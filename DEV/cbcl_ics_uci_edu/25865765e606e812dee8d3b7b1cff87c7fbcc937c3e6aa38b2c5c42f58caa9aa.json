Potkin, Zhaoxia Yu, Xiaohui Xie\n</p><p>\n\nCopyright (C) 2010 Lingjie Weng\n</p><p>\n\nThe code is implemented with Java. The demonstration \ncode can be found here: <a href=\"http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA/SSEA_v1.0.jar\">download\n SSEA</a>.<br>\n\n</p><h3>Instruction of use </h3>\n\t\n<p>\n\nInput files: ( Example input files can be found here: <a href=\"http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/SSEA/exampledata.zip\"> example files</a>.<br>\n<p>\n\n<ul> \n1) SNP genotype file\n<p>\nThe first line contains the SNP ID and a list of phenotype of the subjects,Ca if the subject belongs to case(disease) group, Co if the subject belongs to control group.\n</p><p>\nLine format: SNP_ID(tab)(subject 1 phenotype)(tab)(subject 2 phenotype)(tab) ... (subject N phenotype)\n</p><p>\nExample\u00ef\u00bc\u0161SNPID Ca_1    Co_1    Co_2    Co_3    Ca_2\t...\n</p><p>\nThe remainder of the data file contains data for all SNPs. Rows corresponds to SNPs, columns corresponds to genotype(use 1,2,3 to represent 3 different genotypes AA, AB,BB; use 0 to represent the missing genotype data).\n</p><p>\nExample: rs12082473      1       0       1       1       3\t...\n</p><p>\n\n2) SNP to Gene Mapping file (annotation file)\n</p><p>\nExample: SNPId Gene_Name\n</p><p>\n\n3) Pathway file(the gene sets used for testing were downloaded together with the original GSEA software from KEGG)\n</p><p> \nExample: Pathway_Name\tannotation\tGene_Name1\tGene_Name2\tGene_Name3\t...\n\n3) Phenotype file(this can be obtain from the first line of SNP genotype file, look for example file for detail)\n</p></ul>\n\nOutput:\n<ul>\n<p>\nThis package has two steps: it first use SNP genotype file and annotation file to generate Significant SNP files; together with pathway(SNPset) file would be used as an input for the second step. The \nfinal output file include the pathway name, pathway size, enrichment score and nominal p-value.\n</p></ul>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
