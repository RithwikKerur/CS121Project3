Data</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Social network analysis has a long and successful history in the social sciences, often with a focus on relatively small survey-based data sets. In the past decade, driven by the ease of automatically collecting large-scale network data sets, there has been significant interest in developing new statistical and machine learning techniques for network analysis. In this talk we will focus on two general modeling themes in this context: the use of latent variables for low-dimensional  vector-based  network  representations  models  and  event-based  models  for temporal network data. We will review the representational capabilities of these models from a generative perspective, discuss some of the challenges of parameter estimation that arise, and emphasize the role of predictive evaluation. The talk will conclude with a brief discussion of future directions in this general area. </p>\n<p>Based on joint work with Zach Butler, Chris DuBois, Jimmy Foulds, and Carter Butts</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Jan 18 =================================== --></p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Jan 18</b></div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><b>No Seminar (MLK Day)</b></div>\n<p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Jan 25 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Jan 25</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jfoulds/\"><b>James Foulds</b></a><br />Postdoctoral Fellow<br />Department of Computer Science<br />University of California, San Diego</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Latent Topic Networks: A Versatile Probabilistic Programming Framework for Topic Models</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Topic models have become increasingly prominent text-analytic machine learning tools for research in the social sciences and the humanities. In particular, custom topic models can be developed to answer specific research questions. The design of these models requires a nontrivial amount of effort and expertise, motivating general-purpose topic modeling frameworks. In this talk I will introduce latent topic networks, a flexible class of richly structured topic models designed to facilitate applied research. Custom models can straightforwardly be developed in this framework with an intuitive first-order logical probabilistic programming language. Latent topic networks admit scalable training via a parallelizable EM algorithm which leverages ADMM in the M-step. I demonstrate the broad applicability of the models with case studies on modeling influence in citation networks, and U.S. Presidential State of the Union addresses.  This talk is based on joint work with Lise Getoor and Shachi Kumar from the University of California, Santa Cruz, published at ICML 2015.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Feb 1  =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Feb 1 </b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/furongfionahuang/\"><b>Furong Huang</b></a><br />PhD Candidate<br />Department of Electrical Engineering<br />University of California, Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Discovery of Latent Factors in High-dimensional Data</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Latent or hidden variable models have applications in almost every domain, e.g., social network analysis, natural language processing, computer vision and computational biology. Training latent variable models is challenging due to non-convexity of the likelihood objective function. An alternative method is based on the spectral decomposition of low order moment matrices and tensors.  This versatile framework is guaranteed to estimate the correct model consistently. I will discuss my results on convergence to globally optimal solution for stochastic gradient descent, despite non-convexity of the objective. I will then discuss large-scale implementations (which are highly parallel and scalable) of spectral methods, carried out on CPU/GPU and Spark platforms. We obtain a gain in both accuracies and in running times by several orders of magnitude compared to the state-of-art variational methods. I will discuss the following applications in detail: (1) learning hidden user commonalities (communities) in social networks, and (2) learning sentence embeddings for paraphrase detection using convolutional models. More generally,  I have applied the methods to a variety of problems such as text and social network analysis, healthcare analytics, and cataloging neuronal cell types in neuroscience.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Feb 8  =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Feb 8 </b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/MajidJanzamin/\"><b>Majid Janzamin</b></a><br />PhD Candidate<br />Department of Electrical Engineering<br />University of California, Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Non-convex Optimization in Machine Learning: Provable Guarantees using Spectral Methods</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Optimization lies at the core of machine learning.

The focus of my work is on overcomplete regime where the hidden dimension is larger than the observed dimensionality. I describe how tensor methods enable us to learn these models in the overcomplete regime with theoretical guarantees in recovering the parameters of the model. I also provide efficient sample complexity results for training these models. Next, I will describe a new method for training neural networks for which we provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the algorithm.

Optimization methods, both convex and nonconvex are promising approaches to do this. In this talk I will review two classes of my work on prominent problems in convex and nonconvex optimization.  </p>\n<p>Beating the Perils of Non-Convexity: Guaranteed Training of Neural Networks using Tensor Method: Neural networks provide a versatile tool for approximating functions of various inputs. Despite exciting achievements in application, a theoretical understanding of them is mostly lacking. Training a neural network is a highly nonconvex problem and backpropagation can get stuck in local optima. For the first time, we have a computationally efficient method for training neural networks that also has guaranteed generalization. This is part of our recently proposed general framework based on method-of-moments and tensor decomposition to efficiently learn different models such as neural networks and mixture of classifiers.  </p>\n<p>Breaking Curse of Dimensionality: Stochastic Optimization in high dimensions:  We have designed an efficient stochastic optimization method based on ADMM that is fast and cheap to implement, can be performed in parallel and can be used for any regularized optimization framework with some mild assumptions. We have proved that our algorithm obtains minimax optimal convergence rates for sparse optimization and robust PCA framework. Experiment results show that in the aforementioned scenarios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art, i.e., yields smaller error with equal time.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Oct  5 =================================== --></p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Oct  5</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.eew.caltech.edu/people/\"><b>Gokcan Karakus</b></a><br />Graduate Student<br />Department of Civil Engineering<br />Caltech</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Using Waveform Envelopes in a Bayesian Framework for Earthquake Early Warning</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">We are proposing an algorithm to test the accuracy of the predictions by earthquake early warning systems.

On the other hand, &#8220;reverse&#8221; versions of IS and AIS tend to overestimate the partition function, and degenerate when the target distribution is more peaked than the proposal distribution. We present a simple, general method that gives much more reliable and robust estimates than either IS (AIS) or reverse IS (AIS). Our method works by converting the estimation problem into a simple classification problem that discriminates between the samples drawn from the target and the proposal. We give both theoretical and empirical justification, and show that an annealed version of our method significantly outperforms both AIS and reverse AIS (Burda et al., 2015), which has been the state-of-the-art for likelihood evaluation in deep generative models.

We assume that each message version has a given number of bits. Each server can receive any subset of the v versions and stores a function of the message versions it receives. The multi-version code we consider ensures that, a decoder that connects to any c out of the n servers can recover the message corresponding to the latest common version stored among those servers, or a message corresponding to a version that is later than the latest common version. We describe a simple and explicit achievable scheme, as well as an information-theoretic converse.

Networks can be used to reveal underlying data structures, infer functional modules, and facilitate experiment design. In practice, however, size, uncertainty and complexity of the underlying associations render these applications challenging.  </p>\n<p> In this talk, we illustrate the use of spectral, combinatorial, and statistical inference techniques in several significant network science problems. First, we consider the problem of network alignment where the goal is to find a bijective mapping between nodes of two networks to maximize their overlapping edges while minimizing mismatches. To solve this combinatorial problem, we present a new scalable spectral algorithm, and establish its efficiency theoretically and experimentally over several synthetic and real networks. Next, we introduce network maximal correlation (NMC) as an essential measure to capture nonlinear associations in networks. We characterize NMC using geometric properties of Hilbert spaces and illustrate its application in learning network topology when variables have unknown nonlinear dependencies. Finally, we discuss the problem of learning low dimensional structures (such as clusters) in large networks, where we introduce logistic Random Dot Product Graphs, a new class of networks which includes most stochastic block models as well as other low dimensional structures. Using this model, we propose a spectral network clustering algorithm that possesses robust performance under different clustering setups. In all of these problems, we examine underlying fundamental limits and present efficient algorithms for solving them. We also highlight applications of the proposed algorithms to data-driven problems such as functional and regulatory genomics of human diseases, and cancer.  </p>\n<p> <b>Bio:</b> Soheil Feizi is a PhD candidate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), co-supervised by Prof. Muriel M\u00e9dard and Prof. Manolis Kellis.

This allows us to easily incorporate the statistics of occlusion patterns in a discriminatively trained model. However, this model does not exploit bottom-up cues such as detection of occluding contours and image segments.

In this paper we focus on the problem of learning classifiers to make predictions at the instance level. To achieve this we propose a new objective function that encourages smoothness of inferred instance-level labels based on instance-level similarity, while at the same time respecting group-level label constraints. We apply this approach to the problem of predicting labels for sentences given labels for reviews, using a convolutional neural network to infer sentence similarity. The approach is evaluated using three large review data sets from IMDB, Yelp, and Amazon, and we demonstrate the proposed approach is both accurate and scalable compared to various alternatives.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Dec  7 =================================== --></p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Dec  7</b></div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><b>Finals week</b><br />(no seminar)</div>\n<p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\r\n\t\r\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://cml.ics.uci.edu/2015/09/fall-2015/\" title=\"1:14 pm\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date genericon\" datetime=\"2015-09-15T13:14:09-07:00\">September 15, 2015</time></a>\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\r\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\r\n\r\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<article id=\"post-532\" class=\"post-532 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-aiml\">\r\n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\r\n\t\t<!-- This is the output of the POST THUMBNAIL (if exists): REMOVED (h1 is clear:both) -->\r\n\t\t<!--<div class=\"entry-thumbnail\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div> -->\r\n\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://cml.ics.uci.edu/2015/03/spring-2015/\" title=\"Permalink to Spring 2015\" rel=\"bookmark\">Spring 2015</a></h1>\t\t\t\t<span class=\"entry-format genericon\">Standard</span>\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n\t\t<br />\n<table cellpadding=5 border=1>\n<col width=\"100\">\n<col>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Mar 30 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Mar 30</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.igb.uci.edu/~pfbaldi/\"><b>Pierre Baldi</b></a><br />Chancellor&#8217;s Professor<br />Department of Computer Science<br />UC Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>The Ebb and Flow of Deep Learning: a Theory of Local Learning</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">In a physical neural system, where storage and processing are intertwined, the rules for adjusting the synaptic weights can only depend on variables that are available locally, such as the activity of the pre- and post-synaptic neurons. We propose a systematic framework to define and study the space of local learning rules where one must first define the nature of the local variables, and then the functional form that ties them together into a learning rule. We consider polynomial learning rules and analyze their behavior and capabilities in both linear and non-linear networks. As a byproduct, we also show how this framework enables the discovery of new learning rules and important relationships between learning rules and group symmetries.</p>\n<p> Stacking local learning rules in deep feedforward networks leads to deep local learning. While deep local learning can learn interesting representations, we show however that it cannot learn complex input-output functions, even when targets are available for the top layer. Learning complex input-output functions requires local deep learning where target information is propagated to the deep layers. The complexity of the propagated information about the targets and the channel through which this information is propagated partition the space of learning algorithms and highlight the remarkable power of the backpropagation algorithm. The theory clarifies the concept of Hebbian learning, what is learnable by Hebbian learning, and explains the sparsity of the space of learning rules discovered so far.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Apr  6 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Apr  6</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://ee.usc.edu/nseip/\"><b>Maryam M.

In this talk, I present our work on developing both these types of BMIs, specifically motor BMIs for restoring movement in paralyzed patients and a new BMI for control of the brain state under anesthesia. Motor BMIs have largely used standard signal processing techniques. However, devising novel algorithmic solutions that are tailored to the neural system can significantly improve the performance of these BMIs. Here, I develop a novel BMI paradigm for restoration of motor function that incorporates an optimal feedback-control model of the brain and directly processes the spiking activity using point process modeling. I show that this paradigm significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in closed-loop primate experiments. In addition to motor BMIs, I construct a new BMI that controls the state of the brain under anesthesia. This is done by designing stochastic controllers that infer the brain&#8217;s anesthetic state from non-invasive observations of neural activity and control the real-time rate of drug administration to achieve a target brain state.

Yet, learning their parameters remain a challenging problem. In the first part of the talk I will present a novel approach to learning an HMM whose outputs are distributed according to a parametric family. This is done by decoupling the learning task into two steps: first estimating the output parameters, and then estimating the hidden states transition probabilities. The first step is accomplished by fitting a mixture model to the output stationary distribution. Given the parameters of this mixture model, the second step is formulated as the solution of an easily solvable convex quadratic program. We provide an error analysis for the estimated transition probabilities and show they are robust to small perturbations in the estimates of the mixture parameters.  </p>\n<p> The above approach (and other recently proposed spectral/tensor methods) strongly depends on the assumption that all states have different output distributions. In various applications, however, some of the hidden states are aliased, having identical output distributions. The minimality, identifiability and learnability of such aliased HMMs have been long standing problems, with only partial solutions provided thus far. In the second part of the talk, as a first step, I will focus on parametric-output HMMs that have exactly two aliased states. For this class, we present a complete characterization of their minimality and identifiability. Furthermore, we derive computationally efficient and statistically consistent algorithms to detect the presence of aliasing and learn the aliased HMM transition parameters. We illustrate our theoretical analysis by several simulations.  </p>\n<p> A joint work with Boaz Nadler and Aryeh Kontorovich.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== May 11 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>May 11</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://acsweb.ucsd.edu/~asuresh/\"><b>Ananda Theertha Suresh</b></a><br />PhD student<br />Department of Electrical Engineering<br />UC San Diego</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Approximating Spherical Gaussian Mixtures</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Many statistical and machine-learning applications call for estimating Gaussian mixtures using a limited number of samples and computational time.

As a result, the appropriate division and assignment of a collection of resources to a set of data sources can substantially impact the overall performance of an inferential strategy. In this expository article, we adopt a general view of the notion of a resource and its effect on the quality of a data source, and we describe a framework for the allocation of a given set of resources to a collection of sources in order to optimize a specified metric of statistical efficiency. We discuss several stylized examples involving inferential tasks such as parameter estimation and hypothesis testing based on heterogeneous data sources, in which optimal allocations can be computed either in closed form or via efficient numerical procedures based on convex optimization.

Examples include topic models for documents, hidden Markov models for speech, gaussian mixture models for point data, etc. The model parameters often give interesting semantic insights into the data.  </p>\n<p> I will first discuss algorithms for parameter estimation in mixture models via the use of tensors, or higher dimensional arrays. The idea is to estimate (using the data) a tensor, whose decomposition allows us to read off the hidden parameters. Thus parameter estimation is reduced to tensor decomposition. Unfortunately, tensor decomposition is NP-hard in general. However, I will show that there exist algorithms that &#8220;almost always&#8221; work efficiently, in the framework of smoothed analysis, as long as the &#8220;rank&#8221; is at most a polynomial in the number of dimensions.  </p>\n<p> Next I will consider the case in which we wish to learn mixtures in small (constant number of) dimensions. Tensor methods do not apply to this regime, and indeed, there are lower bounds which say that exponentially many samples are needed to &#8220;identify&#8221; the parameters. However I will show that under a slightly relaxed objective, we can obtain &#8220;PAC&#8221; style learning algorithms.

By using a method called model compression, we show that shallow feed-forward nets can learn the complex functions previously learned by deep nets and achieve accuracies previously only achievable with deep models while using the same number of parameters as the original deep models. On the TIMIT phoneme recognition and CIFAR-10 image recognition tasks, shallow nets can be trained that perform similarly to complex, well-engineered, deeper convolutional architectures. The same model compression trick can also be used to compress impractically large deep models and ensembles of large deep models down to \u201cmedium-size\u201d deep models that run more efficiently on servers, and down to \u201csmall\u201d models that can run on mobile devices. In machine learning and statistics we used to believe that one of the keys to preventing overfitting was to keep models simple and the number of parameters small to force generalization. We no longer believe this &#8212; learning appears to generalize best when training models with excess capacity, but the learned functions can often be represented with far fewer parameters.

In this setting, we show that an accurate appearance model is considerably more effective than a strong motion model. We develop simple but effective algorithms that alternate between tracking and learning a good appearance model given a track. We show that it is crucial to learn from the \u201cright\u201d frames, and use the formalism of self-paced curriculum learning to automatically select such frames. We leverage techniques from object detection for learning accurate appearance-based templates, demonstrating the importance of using a large negative training set (typically not used for tracking).

While much past work focuses on estimation from temporal video sequences, we consider the problem of single-image pose estimation, necessary for (re) initialization. The high number of degrees-of-freedom, frequent self-occlusions, and pose ambiguities make this problem rather challenging. While previous approaches tend to rely on articulated hand models or local part classifiers, our models are based on discriminative pose exemplars that can be quickly indexed with parts. We propose novel metric depth features that make the search over exemplars accurate and fast. Importantly, our exemplar models can reason about depth-aware occlusion. Finally, we also provide an extensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art, including academic and commercial systems, on a real-world annotated dataset.

The model is robust to common parametric and semi-parametric assumptions in that it avoids simple distributional assumptions on longitudinal measures and allows for non-proportional hazards covariate effects in the survival component. Specifically, we use a Gaussian process model with a parameter that captures within-subject volatility in the longitudinally sampled biomarker, where the unknown distribution of the parameter is assumed to have a Dirichlet process prior. We then estimate the association between within-subject volatility and the risk of mortality using a flexible survival model constructed via a Dirichlet process mixture of Weibull distributions.

Broadly speaking, structured prediction refers to any type of prediction performed jointly over multiple input instances, and has been a topic of active research in the machine learning community over the past 10-15 years. However, what has been less studied is how to model structured prediction problems for an interactive system. For example, a recommender system necessarily interacts with users when recommending content, and can learn from the subsequent user feedback on those recommendations. In general, each &#8220;prediction&#8221; is an interaction where the system not only predicts a structured action to perform, but also receives feedback (i.e., training data) corresponding to the utility of that action.  </p>\n<p> In this talk, I will describe methods for balancing the tradeoff between exploration (collecting informative feedback) versus exploitation (maximizing system utility) when making structured predictions in an interactive environment. Exploitation corresponds to the standard prediction goal in non-interactive settings, where one predicts the best possible action given the current model. Exploration refers to taking actions that maximize the informativeness of the subsequent feedback, so that one can exploit more reliably in future interactions. I will show how to model and optimize for this tradeoff in two settings: diversified news recommendation (where the feedback comes from users) and adaptive vehicle routing (where the feedback comes from measuring congestion).  </p>\n<p> This is joint work with Carlos Guestrin, Sue Ann Hong, Ramayya Krishnan and Siyuan Liu.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Nov 24 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Nov 24</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://newport.eecs.uci.edu/anandkumar/MajidJanzamin/\"><b>Majid Janzamin</b></a><br />Graduate Student<br />EECS<br />UC Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Learning overcomplete latent variable models through tensor methods</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Learning several latent variable models including multiview mixtures, mixture of Gaussians, independent component analysis and so on can be done by the decomposition of a low-order moment tensor (e.g., 3rd order tensor) to its rank-1 components.

It could be shown that under separability of topics, \\ell_1 normalized rows of the word-word co-occurence probability matrix are embedded inside a convex polytope, whose vertices correspond only to the novel words of different topics.

One of the main problems underlying graphical models is to infer the values of certain variables based on observations of other variables. Rigorous analysis of statistical inference algorithms can be very complicated even for relatively simple models. Instead, methods based on statistical physics of disordered systems provide a viable alternative. Here I will demonstrate the application of those methods on two problems, MAP estimation of Hidden Markov Models and Stochastic Block Models. The inference in both problems can become highly unstable due to a critical phase transition in the corresponding statistical physical system. Those instabilities are caused by frustrated (e.g., conflicting) constraints that are imposed on the inference objective. I will also discuss how one can mitigate this undesirable feature by active inference, i.e., by adaptively acquiring information about the (true) states of the hidden variables.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Apr 9 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Apr 9</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />4pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://cnls.lanl.gov/~chertkov\"><b>Misha Chertkov</b></a><br />Theory Division<br />Los Alamos National Laboratory</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Complex Energy Systems</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Today\u2019s energy systems, such as electric power grids and gas grids, already demonstrate complex nonlinear dynamics where, e.g., collective effects in one exert uncertainty and irregularities on other.

This problem is relevant to many applications including detecting anomalies in sensor and computer networks, brain activity, co-expressions in gene networks, disease outbreaks, etc. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difficulty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. We develop from first principles the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph with Gaussian noise. Due to the combinatorial nature of this test, the GLRT is computationally infeasible. We discuss two approaches, relaxing the combinatorial GLRT and a wavelet construction over graphs, to overcome this issue.</p>\n<p> One such relaxation that we develop is the graph ellipsoid scan statistic, whose statistical performance is characterized by the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Another relaxation that we have developed is the Lovasz extended scan statistic (LESS), which is based on submodular optimization and the performance is described using electrical network theory. We then introduce the spanning tree wavelet basis over graphs, a localized basis that reflects the topology of the graph. We show that using the uniform spanning tree in the basis construction yields a randomized test with performance guarantees similar to that of the LESS. For each of these tests we compare their statistical guarantees to an information theoretic lower bound. Finally, we consider specific graph models, such as the torus, k-nearest neighbor graphs, and epsilon-random graphs and show that for these graphs we achieve near-optimal risk consistency regimes.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Apr 28 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Apr 28</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~qliu1/\"><b>Qiang Liu</b></a><br />PhD Candidate<br />Department of Computer Science<br />University of California, Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Distributed estimation, information loss and exponential families</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Modern data science applications increasingly involve statistical learning on very large datasets, where the data instances are stored in a distributed way across different nodes of the clusters, with expensive communication costs between nodes. We study a simple communication-efficient learning algorithm that first calculates the local maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) based on the subsets of datasets, and then combines the local MLEs to achieve the best possible approximation to the global MLE, based on the whole dataset jointly. A naive and commonly used combination method is to take the linear average of the local ML estimates; this method; however, this has a sub-optimal error rate, and more critically, can easily break down in practical cases where the parameters are either unidentifiable (e.g., in  mixture models), non-additive, or have complicated structure. In this work, we propose a KL-divergence-based combination method that achieves the best possible error rate, and avoids weaknesses of linear averaging. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that our algorithm exactly recovers the global MLE under full exponential families, and its error rate on general distributions are related to how nearly &#8220;exponential family&#8221; they are &#8212; formally captured by Efron&#8217;s statistical curvature, originally defined by Efron (1975) to extend Fisher and Rao&#8217;s theory of information loss and second order efficiency of the MLE.  In addition, we show that the statistical curvature equals the lower bound of the asymptotic error rate of arbitrary combination methods, and hence represents an intrinsic difficulty measurement of distributed learning in this setting.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== May 5 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>May 5</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~iypark/\"><b>Dennis Park</b></a><br />PhD Candidate<br />Department of Computer Science<br />University of California, Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Tracking people and their poses</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Automatically tracking people and their body poses in unconstrained videos is an important task, as it serves as a foundation for high-level reasoning such as activity recognition.

We demonstrate this using a simple linear regression example. We then introduce a test that can tell from the data whether we are heading for such a situation. If we are, we adjust the learning rate (equivalently: make the prior lighter-tailed, or penalize the likelihood more) in a data-dependent way. The resulting &#8220;safe-Bayesian&#8221; estimator continues to achieve good rates with wrong models. In classification, it learns faster in easy settings, i.e.  when a Tsybakov condition holds. The safe estimator is based on empirical mixability/exp-concavity, which generalizes an idea from worst-case online prediction. Thus, safe estimation connects three paradigms: Bayesian inference, (frequentist) statistical learning theory and (individual sequence) on-line prediction.</p>\n<p>For an informal introduction to the idea, see Larry Wasserman&#8217;s blog: http://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/self-repairing-bayesian-inference/</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Jan 20 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Jan 20</b></div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><b>Martin Luther King, Jr Day</b><br />(no seminar)</div>\n<p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Jan 27 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Jan 27</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~feisha/\"><b>Fei Sha</b></a><br />Assistant Professor<br />Department of Computer Science<br />University of California, Los Angeles</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Learning kernels for visual domain adaptation</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Statistical machine learning has become an important driving force behind many  application fields.

In particular, the data distribution on which statistical models are optimized is the same as the distribution to which the models are applied.</p>\n<p> Real-world applications are far more complex than the pristine condition. For instance, computer vision systems for recognizing objects in images often suffer from significant performance degradation if they are evaluated on image datasets that are different from the dataset on which they are designed.</p>\n<p> In this talk, I will describe our efforts in addressing this important challenge of building intelligent systems that are robust to distribution disparity. The central theme is to learn invariant features, cast as learning kernel functions and adapt probabilistic models across different distributions (i.e., domains). To this end, our key insight is to discover and exploit hidden structures in the data. These structures, such as manifolds and discriminative clusters, are intrinsic and thus resilient to distribution changes due to exogenous factors. I will present several learning algorithms we have proposed and demonstrate their effectiveness in pattern recognition tasks from computer vision.</p>\n<p> This talk is based on the joint work with my students (Boqing Gong and Yuan Shi, both from USC) and our collaborator Prof. Kristen Grauman (U. of Texas, Austin).</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Feb 3 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Feb 3</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rcammaro/\"><b>Rosario Cammarota</b></a><br />System Security Architect<br />Qualcomm Research</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Automatic construction of program optimization strategies</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">An optimization strategy is a mean to improve program performance, e.g., through architectural, execution and development environment enhancements (including new architectural mechanisms/instructions, the use of specialized libraries, new compiler optimizations or compiler optimization sequences, new algorithms).

Algorithms especially in Machine Learning are required to generalize over input fluctuations or randomization during execution.  This talk elaborates a new framework to measure the &#8220;informativeness&#8221; of algorithmic procedures and their &#8220;stability&#8221; against noise.  An algorithm is considered to be a noisy channel which is characterized by a generalization capacity (GC). The generalization capacity objectively ranks different algorithms for the same data processing task based on the bit rate of their respective capacities. The problem of grouping data is used to demonstrate this validation principle for clustering algorithms, e.g. k-means, pairwise clustering, normalized cut, adaptive ratio cut and dominant set clustering. Our new validation approach selects the most informative clustering algorithm, which filters out the maximal number of stable, task-related bits relative to the underlying hypothesis class. The concept also enables us to measure how many bit are extracted by sorting, feature selection or minimum spanning tree algorithms when the respective inputs are contaminated by noise.</p>\n<p><b>Bio:</b>Joachim M.

Formulating the MAP problem as an ILP has led to the development of many approximate inference methods based on linear programming (LP) relaxations, including Tree-Reweighted Belief Propagation, MPLP and Max-Sum Diffusion.  Recent work suggests that going in the opposite direction and posing an ILP as a MAP problem may also prove beneficial. In this talk, I&#8217;ll focus on a classic combinatorial optimization problem, the weighted matching problem, and show that if it is posed as a MAP inference problem then the Max-Product Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm always converges to the MAP configuration. Remarkably, this is true even though the weighted matching graphical model is loopy and BP is neither guaranteed to converge, nor be correct in such models. I&#8217;ll then discuss a cutting plane approach to solving the weighted matching problem that utilizes the BP algorithm to iteratively tighten the LP relaxation of the matching ILP. This line of work improves our understanding of the performance of the loopy BP algorithm in general and further strengthens the theoretical link between message passing algorithms and optimization theory.</p>\n<p>This talk is based on joint work with Misha Chertkov (Los Alamos National Lab) and Jinwoo Shin (KAIST University).</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Feb 17 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Feb 17</b></div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><b>President&#8217;s Day</b><br />(no seminar)</div>\n<p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Feb 24 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Feb 24</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlevorat/\"><b>Marco Levorato</b></a><br />Assistant Professor<br />Department of Computer Science<br />University of California, Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Sparse approximation methods for large scale network control</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">The explosion of the number of devices capable of transmitting and receiving information connected to wireless and wired communication infrastructures, both for human-to-human and machine-to-machine interaction, is forcing a technological transition to a different inter-networking model. The communication infrastructure is merging from a collection of distinct networks to a single super-network deeply integrated with heterogeneous sub-systems. Mobile health-care, smart energy grids and social networks are just examples of complex systems interoperating with the global communication infrastructure. Adaptive learning and control are the key to empower the next generation of communication networks with the ability to operate and interoperate in heterogeneous environments and with heterogeneous sub-systems. However, the high complexity of these systems discourages the use of traditional tools in practice. In this seminar, I will discuss a novel framework for online learning and optimization in complex inter-networked systems based on sparse approximation theory and wavelet analysis. The key observation is that communication protocols, and supposedly natural and human phenomena, induce a structured behavior of the stochastic process tracking the state of the system. This induces a regular structure at different time scales (hop number) of the graph modeling state transitions, and enables dimensionality reduction based on graph wavelet analysis and graph filtering. Sparse approximation algorithms can be then employed to dramatically reduce the number of observations needed to estimate fundamental control functions mapped on the state space of the observed system.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Mar 3 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Mar 3</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.dmi.usherb.ca/~larocheh/index_en.html\"><b>Hugo La Rochelle</b></a><br />Assistant Professor<br />Department of Computer Science<br />Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Deep Learning for Distribution Estimation</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Deep learning methods have shown to be powerful approaches for modelling a large variety of data (speech, computer vision, natural language, biological, etc.) and solve a vast range of machine learning tasks (classification, regression, etc.).

In recent years there has been an explosion in the amount of digital text information available, leading to challenges of scale for traditional inference algorithms for topic models.  In this talk, I will present algorithms for learning and evaluating topic models, quickly, accurately and at scale.</p>\n<p> In part one of the talk I will describe SCVB0, a stochastic variational Bayesian inference algorithm which exploits the collapsed representation of LDA.  The algorithm can fit a topic model to Wikipedia in a matter of hours, and to the NIPS corpus of machine learning articles in seconds.  It is also extremely simple and easy to implement.</p>\n<p> The second part of the talk considers the problem of evaluating topic models by computing the log-likelihood of held-out data, a task which requires approximating an intractable high-dimensional integral.  Annealed importance sampling (AIS), a Monte Carlo integration technique which operates by annealing between two distributions, has previously been successfully used to evaluate topic models.  We introduce new annealing paths which exhibit much lower empirical variance than the previous AIS approach (albeit at the cost of increased bias when given too few iterations), facilitating reliable per-document comparisons of topic models. We then show how to use these paths to evaluate the predictive performance of topic model learning algorithms on a per-iteration basis. The proposed method achieves better estimates at this task than previous algorithms, in some cases with an order of magnitude less computational effort.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Mar 17 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Mar 17</b></div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><b>Finals Week</b><br />(no seminar)</div>\n<p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\r\n\t\r\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://cml.ics.uci.edu/2014/01/winter-2014/\" title=\"3:33 pm\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date genericon\" datetime=\"2014-01-01T15:33:27-07:00\">January 1, 2014</time></a>\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\r\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\r\n\r\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<article id=\"post-503\" class=\"post-503 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-aiml\">\r\n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\r\n\t\t<!-- This is the output of the POST THUMBNAIL (if exists): REMOVED (h1 is clear:both) -->\r\n\t\t<!--<div class=\"entry-thumbnail\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div> -->\r\n\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://cml.ics.uci.edu/2013/09/fall-2013/\" title=\"Permalink to Fall 2013\" rel=\"bookmark\">Fall 2013</a></h1>\t\t\t\t<span class=\"entry-format genericon\">Standard</span>\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n\t\t<br />\n<table cellpadding=5 border=1>\n<col width=\"100\">\n<col>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Sept 26 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Sept 26</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/vferrari/\"><b>Vittorio Ferrari</b></a><br />Reader<br />Department of Informatics<br />University of Edinburgh</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Searching for objects driven by context</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">The dominant visual search paradigm for object class detection is sliding windows.

Traditional survival models (e.g., the prevalent proportional hazards model) often impose strong assumptions on hazard functions, which describe how the risk of an event changes over time depending on covariates associated with each individual. In this paper we propose a nonparametric survival model (GBMCI) that does not make explicit assumptions on hazard functions. Our model trains an ensemble of regression trees by the gradient boosting machine to optimize a smoothed approximation of the concordance index, which is one of the most widely used metrics in survival model evaluation. We benchmarked the performance of GBMCI against other popular survival models with a large-scale breast cancer prognosis dataset.

Some examples include regression models with norm constraints (e.g., Lasso), probit models, many copula models, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models. Bayesian inference involving probability distributions confined to constrained domains could be quite challenging for commonly used sampling algorithms. For such problems, we propose a novel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method that provides a general and computationally efficient framework for handling boundary conditions. Our method first maps the $D$-dimensional constrained domain of parameters to the unit ball ${\\bf B}_0^D(1)$, then augments it to the $D$-dimensional sphere ${\\bf S}^D$ such that the original boundary corresponds to the equator of ${\\bf S}^D$. This way, our method handles the constraints implicitly by moving freely on sphere generating proposals that remain within boundaries when mapped back to the original space. To improve the computational efficiency of our algorithm, we divide the dynamics into several parts such that the resulting split dynamics has a partial analytical solution as a geodesic flow on the sphere. We apply our method to several examples including truncated Gaussian, Bayesian Lasso, Bayesian bridge regression, and a copula model for identifying synchrony among multiple neurons. Our results show that the proposed method can provide a natural and efficient framework for handling several types of constraints on target distributions.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Nov 25 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Nov 25</b></div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><b>Thanksgiving week</b><br />(no seminar)</div>\n<p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== Dec 2 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>Dec 2</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rcammaro/\"><b>Rosario Cammarota</b></a><br />System Security Architect<br />Qualcomm Research</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Rescheduled </b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\"></div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\r\n\t\r\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://cml.ics.uci.edu/2013/09/fall-2013/\" title=\"1:13 pm\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date genericon\" datetime=\"2013-09-01T13:13:33-07:00\">September 1, 2013</time></a>\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\r\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\r\n\r\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<article id=\"post-507\" class=\"post-507 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-aiml\">\r\n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\r\n\t\t<!-- This is the output of the POST THUMBNAIL (if exists): REMOVED (h1 is clear:both) -->\r\n\t\t<!--<div class=\"entry-thumbnail\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div> -->\r\n\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://cml.ics.uci.edu/2013/03/spring-2013/\" title=\"Permalink to Spring 2013\" rel=\"bookmark\">Spring 2013</a></h1>\t\t\t\t<span class=\"entry-format genericon\">Standard</span>\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n\t\t<p>Blank post&#8230;</p>\n\t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-content -->\r\n\t\r\n\t<footer class=\"entry-meta\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://cml.ics.uci.edu/2013/03/spring-2013/\" title=\"1:37 pm\" rel=\"bookmark\"><time class=\"entry-date genericon\" datetime=\"2013-03-10T13:37:44-07:00\">March 10, 2013</time></a>\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t</footer><!-- .entry-meta -->\r\n</article><!-- #post-## -->\r\n\r\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\r\n<article id=\"post-526\" class=\"post-526 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-aiml\">\r\n\t<header class=\"entry-header\">\r\n\t\t<!-- This is the output of the POST THUMBNAIL (if exists): REMOVED (h1 is clear:both) -->\r\n\t\t<!--<div class=\"entry-thumbnail\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div> -->\r\n\t\t<h1 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://cml.ics.uci.edu/2013/03/spring-2013-2/\" title=\"Permalink to Spring 2013\" rel=\"bookmark\">Spring 2013</a></h1>\t\t\t\t<span class=\"entry-format genericon\">Standard</span>\t\t\t</header><!-- .entry-header -->\r\n\r\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\r\n\t\t<br />\n<table cellpadding=5 border=1>\n<col width=\"100\">\n<col>\n<p>  <!-- ==== March 11 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>March 11</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"\"><b>Furong Huang</b></a><br />Graduate Student<br />Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science<br />University of California, Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Learning Mixtures of Tree Graphical Models</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">We consider unsupervised estimation of mixtures of discrete graphical models, where the class variable is hidden and each mixture component can have a potentially different Markov graph structure and parameters over the observed variables.

One example is dynamic in-game advertising, in which ads served over the Internet are seamlessly integrated into the 3D environments of video games played on consoles like the XBox 360. We begin by introducing a plan-track-revise approach for an in-game ad scheduling problem posed by Massive Inc., a pioneer in dynamic in-game advertising that is now part of Microsoft. Using 26 weeks of historical data from Massive, we compare our algorithm&#8217;s ad slotting performance with Massive&#8217;s legacy algorithm over a rolling horizon, and find that we reduce make-good costs by 80-87%, reserve more premium ad slots for future sales, increase the number of unique individuals that see each ad campaign, and deliver ads in a smoother, more consistent fashion over time. Next, we build on our real-world experience and formulate a single-period ad planning problem which emphasizes the core structure of how ads should be planned in a broad class of new media. We develop two efficient algorithms which intelligently aggregate the high-dimensional audience space that results when ad campaigns target very specific cross-sections of the overall population, and use duality theory to show that when the audience space is aggregated using our procedure, near-optimal schedules can be produced despite significant aggregation. Optimality in this case is with respect to a quadratic objective chosen for tractability, however, by explicitly modeling the stochastic nature of viewers seeing ads and the low-level ad slotting heuristic of the ad server, we derive sufficient conditions that tell us when our solution is also optimal with respect to two important practical objectives: minimizing the variance of the number of impressions served, and maximizing the number of unique individuals that are shown each ad campaign.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== April 1 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>April 1</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.usabart.nl\"><b>Bart Knijnenburg</b></a><br />Graduate Student<br />Department of Informatics<br />University of California, Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>ML Opportunities in Privacy Research</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Abstract:</p>\n<p>Personalized systems often require a relevant amount of personal information to properly learn the preferences of the user.

In this talk, we approach thecrowdsourcing problem by transforming it into a standard inference problem in graphical models, and apply powerful inference algorithms such as belief propagation (BP). We show both the naive majority voting and a recent algorithm by Karger, Oh, and Shah are special cases of our BP algorithm under particular modeling choices. With more careful choices, we show that our simple BP performs surprisingly well on both simulated and real-world datasets, competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms based on more complicated modeling assumptions.

As stated in their abstract: &#8220;When a large feedforward neural network is trained on a small training set, it typically performs poorly on held-out test data. This overfitting is greatly reduced by randomly omitting half of the feature detectors on each training case. This prevents complex co-adaptations in which a feature detector is only helpful in the context of several other specific feature detectors. Instead, each neuron learns to detect a feature that is generally helpful for producing the correct answer given the combinatorially large variety of internal contexts in which it must operate. Random \u0081gdropout\u0081h gives big improvements on many benchmark tasks and sets new records for speech and object recognition.&#8221; This seminar will present a mathematical analysis of the dropout algorithm and its intriguing properties.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== April 29 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>April 29</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://staff.science.uva.nl/~whiteson\"><b>Shimon Whiteson</b></a><br />Assistant Professor<br />Informatics Institute<br />University of Amsterdam</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Multi-Objective Decision Making in Collaborative Multi-Agent Systems</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">In collaborative multi-agent systems, teams of agents must coordinate their behavior in order to maximize their common utility.  Such systems are useful, not only for addressing tasks that are inherently distributed, but also for decomposing tasks that would otherwise be too complex to solve. Unfortunately, computing coordinated behavior is computationally expensive because the number of possible joint actions grows exponentially in the number of agents. Consequently, exploiting loose couplings between agents, as expressed in graphical models, is key to rendering such decision making efficient. However, existing methods for solving such models assume there is only a single objective. In contrast, many real-world problems are characterized by the presence of multiple objectives to which the solution is not a single action but the set of actions optimal for all trade-offs between the objectives. In this talk, I will propose a new method for multi-objective multi-agent graphical games that prunes away dominated solutions.  I will also discuss the theoretical support for this method and present an empirical study that shows that it can tackle multi-objective problems much faster than alternatives that do not exploit loose couplings.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== May 6 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>May 6</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~akoratti/\"><b>Anoop Korattikara</b></a><br />Graduate Student<br />Department of Computer Science<br />University of California, Irvine</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the Bias-Variance Tradeoff</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Bayesian posterior sampling can be painfully slow on very large datasets, since traditional MCMC methods such as Hybrid Monte Carlo are designed to be asymptotically unbiased and require processing the entire dataset to generate each sample.

We argue that lower risk estimates can often be obtained using \u0081gapproximate\u0081h MCMC methods that mix very fast (and thus lower the variance quickly) at the expense of a small bias in the stationary distribution. I will first talk about two such biased algorithms: Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics and its successor Stochastic Gradient Fisher Scoring, both of which use stochastic gradients estimated from mini-batches of data, allowing them to mix very fast. Then I will present our current work on a new (biased) MCMC algorithm that uses a sequential hypothesis test to approximate the Metropolis-Hastings test, allowing us to accept/reject samples with high confidence using only a fraction of the data required for the exact test.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== May 13 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>May 13</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~katef/\"><b>Katerina Fragkiadaki</b></a><br />Graduate Student<br />Department of Computer Science<br />University of Pennsylvania</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Multi-Granularity Steering for Human Actions: Motion, Pose and Intention</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Tracking people and their body pose in videos is a central problem in computer vision.

However, predicting a single (most probable) hypothesis is often suboptimal when training data is noisy or underlying model is complex. As an alternative, various M-best algorithms have been introduced mainly in speech recognition community.

The presented methods and algorithms will be validated on implemented SAR systems evaluated byhuman subject cohorts from a variety of user populations, including stroke patients, children with autism spectrum disorder, and elderly with Alzheimers and other forms of dementia.</p>\n<p>Bio:</p>\n<p> Maja Mataric is professor and Chan Soon-Shiong chair in Computer Science, Neuroscience, and Pediatrics at the University of Southern California, founding director of the USC Center for Robotics and Embedded Systems (cres.usc.edu), co-director of the USC Robotics Research Lab (robotics.usc.edu) and Vice Dean for Research in the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.

The underlying themes are power consumption, the massive increase in concurrency, and architectural balance for \u201cBig Data\u201d systems. Applications that require balance are presented in astronomy, high-energy physics, and engineering. Optimal uncertainty quantification is shown as a way to rigorously connect simulations with Big Data.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== June 14 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>June 14</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />2 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://web.it.kth.se/~nimad/\"><b>Nima Dokoohaki</b></a><br />Postdoctoral Research Assistant<br />Department of Software and Computer Systems<br />Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Trust-Aware User Profile Mining, Recommendation and Retrieval</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">We have introduced the notion of augmenting user profiling process with trust, as a solution to the problem of uncertainty and unmanageable exposure of personal data during access, mining and retrieval by web applications. Our solution suggests explicit modeling of trust and embedding trust metrics and mechanisms within very fabric of user profiles. This has in turn allowed information systems to consume and understand this extra knowledge in order to improve interaction and collaboration among individuals and system. When formalizing such profiles, another challenge is to realize increasingly important notion of privacy preferences of users. The profiles are designed in a way to incorporate preferences of users allowing target systems to understand privacy concerns of users during their interaction. Highlighted results start from modeling of adaptive user profiles incorporating users taste, trust and privacy preferences. This in turn led to proposal of several ontologies for user and content characteristics modeling for improving indexing and retrieval of user content and profiles across the platform. Sparsity and uncertainty of profiles were studied through frameworks of data mining and machine learning of profile data taken from on-line social networks. Results of mining and population of data from social networks along with profile data increased the accuracy of intelligent suggestions made by system to improving navigation of users in on-line and off-line museum interfaces. These results were highlighted mainly under the context of EU FP7 Smartmuseum project.</p>\n<p>We also introduced several trust-based recommendation techniques and frameworks capable of mining implicit and explicit trust across ratings networks taken from social and opinion web. Resulting recommendation algorithms have shown to increase accuracy of profiles, through incorporation of knowledge of items and users and diffusing them along the trust networks. At the same time focusing on automated distributed management of profiles, we showed that coverage of system can be increased effectively, surpassing comparable state of art techniques. We have clearly shown that trust clearly increases accuracy of suggestions predicted by system. To assure overall privacy of such value-laden systems, privacy was given a direct focus when architectures and metrics were proposed and shown that a joint optimal setting for accuracy and perturbation techniques can maintain accurate output. Finally, focusing on hybrid models of web data and recommendations motivated us to study impact of trust in the context of topic-driven recommendation in social and opinion media, which in turn helped us to show that leveraging content-driven and tie-strength networks can improve systems accuracy for several important web computing tasks.</p>\n<p>Speaker Bio:</p>\n<p>Nima Dokoohaki holds a MSc (2007) in software engineering of distributed systems, and a PhD (2013) in information and communication technologies from KTH-Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.
