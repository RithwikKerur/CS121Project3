Sparse Markov and Independence Domains</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Fitting high-dimensional data involves a delicate tradeoff between faithful representation and the use of sparse models. Too often, sparsity assumptions on the fitted model are too restrictive to provide a faithful representation of the observed data. In this talk, we present a novel framework incorporating sparsity in different domains. We decompose the observed covariance matrix into a sparse Gaussian Markov model (with a sparse precision matrix) and a sparse independence model (with a sparse covariance matrix). Our framework incorporates sparse covariance and sparse precision estimations as special cases and thus introduces a richer class of high-dimensional models. We characterize sufficient conditions for identifiability of the two models, \\viz Markov and independence models. We propose an efficient decomposition method based on a modification of the popular $\\ell_1$-penalized maximum-likelihood estimator ($\\ell_1$-MLE). We establish that our estimator is consistent in both the domains, i.e., it successfully recovers the supports of both Markov and independence models, when the number of samples $n$ scales as $n = \\Omega(d^2 \\log p)$, where $p$ is the number of variables and $d$ is the maximum node degree in the Markov model. Our experiments validate these results and also demonstrate that our models have better inference accuracy under simple algorithms such as loopy belief propagation.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== January 14 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>January 14</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~cshelton\"><b>Christian Shelton</b></a><br />Associate Professor<br />Department of Computer Science and Engineering<br />University of California, Riverside</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Machine Learning for Critical Care Medicine</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Medicine is becoming a &#8220;big data&#8221; discipline.

This this talk I will discuss my work in collaboration with Children&#8217;s Hospital Los Angeles in applying machine learning to improve health care, particularly pediatric intensive care.  I will use two current projects to drive the discussion: (1) monitoring of blood CO2 and pH levels for patients on mechanical ventilation and (2) predicting acute kidney injury and identifying potential causes.  I will describe the data collection, how the data do and do not fit into machine learning assumptions, and the current state and trends in medical data.  Both problems have been tackled with a variety of methods and I will summarize our findings and lessons in applying machine learning to medical data.</p>\n<p>Bio:</p>\n<p>Christian Shelton is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California at Riverside.

We model the interactions via a dynamic social network with joint edge and vertex dynamics. It is natural to expect that the accuracy of vertex prediction (i.e. whether an actor participates or not at a given time) strongly affects the ability to predict dynamic network evolution accurately.  A conditional latent random field (CLRF) model is employed here to model the joint vertex evolution. This model family can incorporate dependence in vertex co-presence, found in many social settings (e.g., subgroup structure, selective pairing). Moreover, it can incorporate the effect of covariates (e.g. seasonality).  We introduce a novel approach for fitting such CLRF models which leverages on the recent results for learning latent tree models and combines it with a parametric model for covariate effects and a logistic model for edge prediction (i.e. social interactions) given the vertex predictions. We apply this approach to both synthetic data and a classic social network data set involving interactions among windsurfers on a Southern California beach. Experiments conducted show the potential to discover hidden social relationship structures and a significant improvement in prediction accuracy of the vertex and edge set evolution (about 45% for conditional vertex participation accuracy and 122% for overall edge prediction accuracy) over the baseline dynamic network regression approach.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== February 4 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>February 4</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"\"><b>Matthias Blume</b></a><br />Senior Director of Analytics<br />CoreLogic</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Entity Disambiguation</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">Entity disambiguation (a.k.a.

Networks are interesting for machine learning because they grow in interesting ways. A person joins a social network because their friend is already in it. A patient joins a network of disease infection because they are in contact with someone who has been infected. A new bridge is built because there are major transportation facilities on both sides of a body of water. Networks form iteratively; each new cohort of nodes depends on nodes already present. This talk discusses a way to apply machine learning methods to network classifiers for networks that grow by adding cohorts.</div></div><div class=\"clear\"></div>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== February 18 (no seminar) =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>February 18 (no seminar)</b></div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top class='aiml-none'>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><b>Presidents&#8217; Day</b></div>\n<p>\n  </td>\n</tr>\n<p>  <!-- ==== February 25 =================================== --> </p>\n<tr>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-date\"><b>February 25</b><br />Bren Hall 4011<br />1 pm</div>\n</td>\n<td valign=top>\n<div class=\"aiml-name\"><a href=\"http://www.isi.edu/integration/people/lerman/index.html\"><b>Kristina Lerman</b></a><br />Project Leader<br />University of Southern California/Information Sciences Institute</div>\n<p>\n  <div class=\"toggle clearfix wp_shortcodes_toggle\"><div class=\"wps_togglet\"><span><a><b>Social Dynamics of Information</b></a></span></div><div class=\"togglec clearfix\">It is widely believed that information spreads through a social network much like a virus, with \u201cinfected\u201d individuals transmitting it to their friends, enabling information to reach many people. However, our studies of social media indicate that most information epidemics fail to reach viral proportions. We show that psychological factors fundamentally distinguish social contagion from viral contagion. Specifically, people have finite attention, which they divide over all incoming stimuli.

I will go over the recent work on using copulas in two different settings. In the first setting, the graphical models are developed for copulas with the goal of modeling of non-Gaussian multivariate real-valued data.  I will focus on tree-structured copulas in particular as they provide a convenient building block for such models and their applications to modeling of multi-site rainfall. The second setting, copulas are used to construct non-parametric robust estimators of dependence (e.g, information).

In order to test our system we recorded data from 10 babies admitted to the newborn intensive care unit at the UCI Medical Center. We demonstrate a Markov model based technique for recognizing gestures from accelerometers that explicitly represent duration. We do this by embedding an Erlang-Cox state transition model, which has been shown to accurately represent the first three moments of a general distribution, within a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). The transition probabilities in the DBN can be learned via Expectation-Maximization or by using closed-form solutions. We show that by treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling duration, we improve the recognition of Cramped Syn- chronized General Movements, a motion highly correlated with an eventual diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy. Validated video observation annotations were utilized as ground truth.

By way of example, inference in distributed sensor networks presents a fundamental trade-off between the utility in a distributed set of measurements versus the resources expended to acquire them, fuse them into a model of uncertainty, and then transmit the resulting model. Active approaches seek to manage sensing resources so as to maximize a utility function while incorporating constraints on resource expenditures. Such approaches are complicated by several factors. Firstly, the complexity of sensor planning is typically exponential in both the number of sensing actions and the planning time horizon. Consequently, optimal planning methods are intractable excepting for very small scale problems. Secondly, the choice of utility function may vary over time and across users. Approximate approaches (c.f. [Zhao et al., 2002, Kreucher et al., 2005]) have been proposed that treat a subset of these issues; however, the approaches are indirect and do not scale to large problems. In this presentation, I will discuss the use of information measures for resource allocation in distributed sensing systems. Such measures are appealing due to a variety of useful properties. For example, recent results of [Nguyen et al., 2009] link a class of information measures to surrogate risk functions and their associated bounds on excess risk [Bartlett et al., 2003]. Consequently, these measures are suitable proxies for a wide variety of risk functions. I will discuss a method [Williams et al., 2007a] which enables long time-horizon sensor planning in the context of state estimation with a distributed sensor network. The approach integrates the value of information discounted by resource expenditures over a rolling time horizon. Simulation results demonstrate that the resulting algorithm can provide similar estimation performance to that of greedy and myopic methods for a fraction of the resource expenditures. Furthermore, recently developed methods [Fisher III et al., 2009] have been shown to be useful for estimating these quantities in complex signal models. Finally, one consequence of this algorithmic development are new fundamental performance bounds for information gathering systems [Williams et al., 2007b] which show that, under mild assumptions, optimal (though intractable) planning schemes can yield no better than twice the performance of greedy methods for certain choices of information measures. The bound can be shown to be sharp. Additional on-line computable bounds, often tighter in practice, are presented as well.</p>\n<p>This is joint work with Georgios Papachristoudous, Jason L.

Riemannian Manifold HMC (RMHMC) further improves HMC&#8217;s performance by exploiting the geometric properties of the parameter space. However, the geometric integrator used for RMHMC involves implicit equations that require costly numerical analysis (e.g., fixed-point iteration). In some cases, the computational overhead for solving implicit equations undermines RMHMC&#8217;s benefits. To avoid this problem, we propose an explicit geometric integrator that replaces the momentum variable in RMHMC by velocity. We show that the resulting transformation is equivalent to transforming Riemannian Hamilton dynamics to Lagrangian dynamics. Experimental results show that our method improves RMHMC&#8217;s overall computational efficiency.

Probabilistic Bayesian methods such as Markov random fields are well suited for describing ambiguous images and videos, providing us with the natural conceptual framework for representing the uncertainty in interpreting them and automatically learning model parameters from training data.

With Perturb-and-MAP random fields we thus turn powerful deterministic energy minimization methods into efficient probabilistic random sampling algorithms that bypass costly Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) and can generate in a fraction of a second independent random samples from mega-pixel sized images. I will discuss how the Perturb-and-MAP model relates to the standard Gibbs MRF and how it can be used in conjunction with other approximate Bayesian computation techniques.
