Subsequent  sub-reactions can be generated\n procedurally, and any potential \u201cnew\u201d kMech  enzyme mechanisms that \nfall within the pattern abstracted from previous motifs need  not be \ncreated explicitly.&nbsp; </p>\n\t  <p>     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The highly parameterized\n reaction types of SigMech,  together with the kMechReaction classes in \nthe Sigmoid schema, provide a parameterized representation  that \nencompasses all previous Compound reactions that were present in the \nSigmoid  schema, and can generate these and other novel reaction \nmechanisms from the  cross product of the valid SigMech input \nparameters.&nbsp; This development effectively renders kMech  \nintegration a solved problem within the scope of previous reaction \nmotifs, and  will vastly reduce the need for frequent updates of the \nSigmoid schema, database,  middleware translation and GUI.&nbsp; </p>\n\t  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SigMech  combines the \nreaction motifs of previous kMech reaction mechanisms, with the  \nconversion phase that was implemented in the three-stage xCellerator \nreaction  (ThreeStageCatalytic in the Sigmoid schema) yielding a greater\n parameter space  of possible enzymatic reaction mechanisms that can be \ngenerated on the fly  inside SME, and that can consequently be simulated\n by Mathematica/ xCellerator.</p>\n    </div>\n      </div>\n      <div id=\"research\" class=\"pagesection\">\n        <div class=\"sectbody\">\n\t      <p>SigMech integrated with the Sigmoid Model Explorer can be found <a href=\"http://computableplant.ics.uci.edu/%7Ecompanib/SigMech/\">here</a> as a Java .jar executable.<br>\n        </p></div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  \n\n</body></html>", "encoding": "utf-8"}
