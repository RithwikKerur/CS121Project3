Also, fitting the resulting\ndata to dynamical models requires a flexible modeling framework for\ncoupled mechanical and regulatory networks.  For these problems we develop\na mathematical foundation based on the use of a ?dynamical grammar?\ncapable of representing discrete-time events such as cell division that\nchange the number of objects and their relationships, as well as\ncontinuous-time processes arising from regulatory networks and mechanical\ninteractions.  The resulting algorithms are being used to assist\nexperimental research on mechanisms of meristem maintenance and\nphyllotaxis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJoint work with Tigran Bacarian, Pierre Baldi, Ashish Bhan, Victoria Gor,\nMarcus Heisler, Henrik J\u00c3\u00b6nsson, Elliot Meyerowitz, Venu Reddy, Alex\nSadovsky, Bruce Shapiro.

He has served on the faculties of Yale University, the\nUniversity of California San Diego, the California Institute of\nTechnology, and the University of California Irvine where he is currently\na member of the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics and the Computer\nScience Department.  He has also served as a leading member of the Machine\nLearning Systems Group at the Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  His\nresearch interests are largely connected with the construction of\nscientific inference systems, using techniques from machine learning,\npattern recognition, nonlinear optimization, statistical physics and other\nmathematical disciplines to further research into computational biology\nand other sciences.\n</p>\n\n<hr width=\"100%\">\n</body></html>", "encoding": "ISO-8859-1"}
