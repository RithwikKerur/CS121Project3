Cyber @ UCI has come a long\nway since our inception several years ago, but that does not mean the work ends here.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/micah-raney_teamwork-teaching-training-activity-6508537449646559232-Wzw9\">LinkedIn post</a>,\nI shared a bit more of my learning and experience on the CCDC recruitment, training, and competition process.</p>\n\n<div class=\"box\">\n  <p>\n  WOW!<br /><br />\n\n  Cyber @ UCI's CCDC Team just won 3rd Place at the Western Regional Cybersecurity Competition, facing Universities from California, Arizona, and Nevada. We also won 3rd best for service up-time, as well as first for Blue Team/defense overall.\n  <br />\n\n  As the Linux Captain, it has definitely been a wild ride over the past year. There is just so much to learn, and breaking that down and utilizing all our strengths to build a cohesive team definitely isn't easy. Primarily, I took away lessons in teamwork, teaching, and training.\n  <br /><br />\n\n  <b>Teamwork</b><br />\n  The live environment does not lend well to one-man shows. You have to trust your team to do the best and jump in there.\n  <br /><br />\n\n  <b>Teaching</b><br />\n  In our team, every member also had to become a teacher. We worked hard to make our team a place open to that teaching process.\n  <br /><br />\n\n  <b>Training</b><br />\n  Unless you're intentional about training, it does not happen. Our final training regimen was focused intentional, and ultimately effective.\n  <br /><br />\n\n  I am SO proud of the team, and all the work they put in over these past two years. We've put in hundreds of hours of staring at man pages, debugging systems, struggling over integrations, and preparing for this competition. Thank you to all the volunteers that made this event happen!\n  #teamwork #teaching #training #cybersecurity #wrccdc #ccdc\n  <br /><br />\n  </p>\n\n  (Originally posted on LinkedIn)\n\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"whats-next\">What\u2019s Next?</h3>\n<p>The CCDC coordinating team has compiled a report on what went right, and more importantly,\nwhat went wrong in training for the 2018-19 season. Those inputs as well as team feedback\nare being strongly considered as we revamp for the upcoming season. Stay tuned for more details\nas the club drives forwards into next year!</p>\n\n<p>- <em>Micah Raney | 2018-19 Linux Team Captain &amp; CCDC Coordinator</em></p>\n</p>\n      \t\t</section>\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<!-- Footer -->\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<footer>\n              <ul class=\"actions\">\n                <li><a href=\"/blog/\" class=\"button\">Our Blog</a></li>\n              </ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</footer>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<!-- Footer -->\n        <footer id=\"footer\">\n</footer>\n<!-- Copyright -->\n<div id=\"copyright\">\n  <ul><li>&copy; Cyber @ UCI</li><li>&copy; HTML5 UP</li><li>Design by <a href=\"https://html5up.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTML5 UP</a> and <a href=\"http://micahraney.com\">Micah Raney</a></li><li>Jekyll Integration by <a href=\"https://slapform.com\">Slapform</a> </li></ul>\n  <br>\n  <a href=\"https://www.iubenda.com/privacy-policy/20257280\" class=\"w3-medium iubenda-black iubenda-embed \" title=\"Privacy Policy\">Privacy Policy</a> <script type=\"text/javascript\">(function (w,d) {var loader = function () {var s = d.createElement(\"script\"), tag = d.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; s.src=\"https://cdn.iubenda.com/iubenda.js\"; tag.parentNode.insertBefore(s,tag);}; if(w.addEventListener){w.addEventListener(\"load\", loader, false);}else if(w.attachEvent){w.attachEvent(\"onload\", loader);}else{w.onload = loader;}})(window, document);</script>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n      <!-- Scripts -->\n  \t\t<!-- DYN -->\n<script src=\"/assets/js/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/assets/js/skel.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/assets/js/util.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"/assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n\n\t\t\t<script async src=\"https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-88419750-1\"></script>\n<script>\n  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];\n  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)};\n  gtag('js', new Date());\n\n  gtag('config', 'UA-88419750-1');\n</script>\n\n\n\t</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
