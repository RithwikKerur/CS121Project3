We will see how they use Git to collaborate in the CS122B class.\r\n\r\nSetting up Git:\r\n\r\n 1. Each student creates a github account, and shares his/her github username with the CS122B staff on this [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B0eu9Zt5gtaHdBFMnPnYb1mYzzpBPUcEKjmeGEiRC6E/edit#gid=172016701 spreadsheet].\r\n 1. The staff will send each of them an invitation to join the \u201cUCI-chenli-teaching\u201d organization. Both accept the invitation and are added to the organisation.\r\n 1. Bob creates a repository called \u201ccs122b-winter18-team-999\u201d on Github.com under this organization. Make sure to make it \u201cprivate\u201d (default setting). The repository is initially empty.\r\n\r\nUsing Git:\r\n\r\n 1. On his local machine, Bob installs a Git client by following the instructions [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git here].\r\n 1. He then does the following:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nmkdir mycs122b-projects\r\ncd mycs122b-projects\r\ngit init\r\necho \"Cool project\" > README.md          - creates a README file\r\ngit status          - check the status of the repository\r\ngit add README.md          - The file is initially untracked by Git. 'git add' moves it to staged.\r\ngit status           - check the status of the repository after staging the file\r\ngit commit \u2013m \"First Commit\"          - The staged files are committed locally.\r\ngit status          - check the status of the repository after committing the file\r\n}}}\r\n 3. The local repository now has to be linked to the remote repository. For that Bob does the following:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-winter18-team-999.git \r\ngit push -u origin master\r\n}}}\r\n 4. Bob now wants to start on project 1. He creates a new branch from the master branch for this.\r\n\r\n{{{\r\ngit branch            - This command is used to check which branch you are on and what branches are there in your repository. master should be highlighted as you are on master branch. \r\ngit checkout -b bob-feature1            - This command creates a new branch and copies all the code from the previous (i.e. master in our case) branch into the new branch. \r\nmkdir project1 \r\ncd project1 \r\necho \"SELECT * FROM stars\" > mysql-script.sql \r\ngit add mysql-script.sql \r\ngit commit -m \"added mysql command\"            - commits changes locally to the bob-feature1 branch \r\ngit push --set-upstream origin bob-feature1            - creates a remote tracking branch for the local bob-feature1 branch\r\n}}}\r\n 5. Alice wants to contribute too. She can see the changes on Github.com and adds some comments. She wants the code on her system so that she can make changes and test them. She does the following:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nmkdir gitclones \r\ncd gitclones \r\ngit clone https://<Alice's username>@github.com:UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-winter18-team-999.git             - brings the repository onto her system \r\ncd cs122b-winter18-team-999 \r\ngit checkout bob-feature1             - She is initially on master branch. This statement changes her branch bob-feature1 branch. She can now see project 1 code and does the required changes. \r\ngit add mysql-script.sql \r\ngit commit -m \"minor changes\" \r\ngit push             - pushes the commit to bob-feature1 remote branch\r\n}}}\r\n 6. Bob wants to continue coding. But before proceeding to modify any files, it's always a good idea to do 'git pull' so that the local branch pulls the latest code from the remote branch. Bob does:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\ngit branch             - to see which branch he is on. He sees he is on bob-feature1 branch. \r\ngit pull             - pulls the latest code. Bob now sees the changes that Alice pushed.\r\n}}}", "encoding": "utf-8"}
