We are more likely to quickly respond to questions via Piazza than via email.\r\n\r\n== Meeting Times & Places ==\r\n\r\nTime: !Mon/Wed 2:00-3:20 PM [[BR]] Place: DBH 1423 [[BR]] \r\n\r\n----\r\n== Course Overview ==\r\nThis two-course sequence is intended to be the \"grand finale\" for Data Science majors.\r\nIts goal is to tie together many of the topics that are independently covered in the first 3+ years of Data Science requirements and electives; it also aims to fill in in some of the potential gaps required to solve an end-to-end problem. \r\nIn addition to a brief review of some of the required skills, the course will cover problem definition and analysis, data representation, algorithm selection, solution validation, and results presentation.\r\nStudents will do projects, possibly in small teams, while the lecture periods will cover analysis alternatives, project planning, and data analysis issues.\r\nThe first quarter will emphasize tools and techniques, approach selection, project planning, and experimental design.\r\nThe second quarter will focus on project execution, data analysis, and presentation of results.\r\nProject planning and execution will include the setting of weekly or bi-weekly milestones as well as weekly progress tracking and reporting.\r\nThe final course deliverables will include both a written project report and an oral presentation of the project results.\r\n\r\n== Prerequisites ==\r\nSenior standing and completion of the following courses: STATS 68, STATS 111, IN4MATX 43, COMPSCI 122A, COMPSCI 161, and COMPSCI 178.\r\n\r\n== Textbooks ==\r\n\r\n''Data Wrangling with Python: Tips and Tools to Make Your Life Easier'' [[BR]]\r\nBy Jacqueline Kazil and Katharine Jarmul, O'Reilly Media, 2016.\r\n\r\n''Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, !NumPy, and IPython'' (2nd Edition)[[BR]]\r\nBy William !McKinney, O'Reilly Media, 2017.\r\n\r\n''Principles of Data Wrangling: Practical Techniques for Data Preparation'' [[BR]]\r\nBy Joseph Hellerstein, Jeffrey Heer, Tye Rattenbury, Sean Kandel, and Connor Carreras, O'Reilly Media, 2017.\r\n\r\n''Mining the Social Web'' (2nd Edition, Chapters 1 and 9 in particular) [[BR]]\r\nBy Matthew Russell, O'Reilly Media, 2014.\r\n\r\n''Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and !TensorFlow'' (Chapters 1 through 4 in particular) [[BR]]\r\nBy Aurelien Geron, O'Reilly Media, 2017.\r\n\r\n(''Note:'' All of these titles are available for free online via the UCI Library's subscription to Safari Books Online (http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/).\r\n\r\n== Other Resources  ==\r\nhttps://chrisalbon.com/#articles -- A great collection of relevant how-to and tutorial articles.\r\n\r\n[attachment:\"AsterixDBOverview.pdf\" AsterixDB Overview]-- An overview of Apache AsterixDB (a homegrown NoSQL DB system: http://asterixdb.apache.org/).\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/search/api-reference/get-search-tweets -- Twitter search API documentation.\r\n\r\nNote on machine learning from Prof Alex Ihler's CS 178 course: http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Classes/2016W-178\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Topic Coverage and Work Schedule ==\r\n=== Winter Quarter Syllabus ===\r\n|| '''Date''' || '''Lecture Topic''' || '''Relevant Resources''' ||\r\n|| Mon, 1/08 || Course overview and plan ||  Slides from Lecture 1 ||\r\n|| Wed, 1/10 || Dusting off your databases || Your CS122a textbook ||\r\n|| Mon, 1/15 || ''(No Class)'' || ''(No Class)'' ||\r\n|| Wed, 1/17 || Data wrangling concepts and issues || Hellerstein ''et al'' book ||\r\n|| Mon, 1/22 || Wrangling with Pandas and Dataframes I || !McKinney book (Ch. 4, 5) ||\r\n|| Wed, 1/24 || Wrangling with Pandas and Dataframes II || !McKinney book (Ch. 7, 8, 10 ) ||\r\n|| Mon, 1/29 || XML, JSON, Twitter, and Tweepy || !McKinney book (Ch. 6) & Twitter Search API docs ||\r\n|| Wed, 1/31 ||Semistructured data and SQL vs. NoSQL databases || AsterixDB overview paper ||\r\n|| Mon, 2/05 || Exploratory data analysis and data visualization  || Class lecture slides ||\r\n|| Wed, 2/07 || Cluster analysis algorithms  ||Unsupervised learning notes from 178 above||\r\n|| Mon, 2/12 ||  Predictive modeling: regression ||Chapters 2 and 4 in Geron text||\r\n|| Wed, 2/14 || Predictive modeling: classification ||Chapter 3 in Geron text ||\r\n|| Mon, 2/19 || ''(No Class)'' || ||\r\n|| Wed, 2/21 || Text analysis methods || ||\r\n|| Mon, 2/26 || Project planning, proposals and guidelines || ||\r\n|| Wed, 2/28 || Project idea meetings  || ||\r\n|| Mon, 3/05 || Project planning meetings || ||\r\n|| Wed, 3/07 || Project planning meetings (cont.) || ||\r\n|| Mon, 3/12 || Oral project proposal meetings || ||\r\n|| Wed, 3/14 || Oral project proposal presentations || ||\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Assignments, Projects, and Grading ==\r\n\r\n=== Grading Criteria (for 170A) ===\r\nHomework: 40% [[BR]]\r\nProject proposal: 50% [[BR]]\r\nClass participation: 10% [[BR]]\r\n[[BR]]\r\nLate homeworks will not be graded - please submit whatever you have completed by the homework deadline.  Each homework's due date is listed in the table of homework assignments at the end of this page, and each homework will be due in EEE by 11:45 PM on the indicated date.\r\n\r\nA single grade will be assigned at the end of Spring quarter for this class, with 50% weight on the Winter grade and 50% on the Spring grade.\r\n\r\n=== Homework and Class Participation ===\r\nThe first quarter will involve a mix of lectures and homework assignments intended to dust off, sharpen, or introduce the skills, tools, and techniques that you will need to successfully execute your course project. Since you are now seniors, and this is your Data Science grand finale, individual initiative and engagement will be expected of all students. The homework assignments may be \"looser\" than what you are used to -- you will have to seek out some of the information needed to complete the assignments and to make  choices about how to attack some of the challenges -- i.e., spoon feeding will be kept to a minimum. The lectures will aim for interactivity, and class participation will be encouraged (and in fact expected).\r\n\r\n=== Academic Honesty Policy ===\r\nStudents will be expected to adhere to the UCI and ICS Academic Honesty policies (see http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm#academic and http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty to read their details). Any student found to somehow be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means that you could fail this course in its entirety. (Ask around - it's happened.)  Just say ''no'' to cheating!\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Software Platform(s) ==\r\nThis course will make use of the Python ecosystem, including the Python language, various Python packages/tools for data analysis and machine learning, Jupyter notebooks, and open source databases (PostgreSQL).  For convenience and package completeness, students are advised to download the most recent Anaconda distribution of Python and friends (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the most recent EDB distribution of PostgreSQL (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Assignment Due Dates & Links ==\r\n\r\n(Be sure to monitor this space carefully as the days and weeks go by!)\r\n\r\n|| '''Assignment''' || '''Due Date (and Time)''' || '''Topic''' || '''Details''' ||\r\n|| HW 1 || Wed, 1/17 (Noon) || Schemas and SQL Refresher  || [attachment:\"HW1.pdf\" HW1] ||\r\n|| HW 2 || Mon, 1/22 (11:45 PM)  || Data Wrangling Principles || [attachment:\"HW2.pdf\" HW2] ||\r\n|| HW 3 || Mon, 1/29 (11:45 PM)  || Data Wrangling with Python and Pandas || [attachment:\"HW3.pdf\" HW3] ||\r\n|| HW 4 || Mon, 2/05 (11:45 PM)  || Capturing and Wrangling Twitter Data || [attachment:\"HW4.pdf\" HW4] ||\r\n|| HW 5 || Mon, 2/12 (2 PM)  || Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization || [attachment:\"HW5.pdf\" HW5] ||\r\n|| HW 6 || Wed, 2/21 (2 PM)  || Predictive Regression Models || [attachment:\"HW6.pdf\" HW6] ||\r\n|| HW 7 || Wed, 2/28 (2 PM)  || Classification with Text Data || [attachment:\"HW7.pdf\" HW7] ||\r\n|| Proj 1 || Wed, 3/07 (11:45 PM)  || Written Project Proposal, Take 1 || [attachment:\"Proj1.pdf\" Proj1] ||\r\n|| Proj 2 || Mon, 3/12 (11:45 PM)  || Written Project Proposal, Take 2 || [attachment:\"Proj2.pdf\" Proj2] ||\r\n|| Proj 3 || Wed, 3/14 (due in class) || Oral Project Proposal || [attachment:\"Proj3.pdf\" Proj3] ||\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
