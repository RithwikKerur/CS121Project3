It covers the entity relationship (E/R) approach to database design. It then covers the relational data model, mapping of E/R designs to relations, relational database design principles, abstract query languages such as the relational algebra and relational calculus, and the industry-standard query language, SQL. Students will gain exposure to how relational database management systems are used to manage an actual database. Time permitting, the course will also touch lightly on advanced database management topics.\r\n\r\nThis course is aimed at database design and the use of database management systems in implementing database applications. It feeds into a follow-on project course, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs122b CS122B], whose focus is data-centric Web applications. The CS122A/B course sequence does NOT cover the internals of database systems; that material is covered in the undergraduate course [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs122c CS122C] (co-listed as [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~cs222 CS222]) and its graduate-level follow-on course CS223.  (The course textbook also delves further into that material for those students who are curious about what goes on under the hood.)  Interested students are strongly encouraged to take one, two, or all of these courses. CS122B and CS122C/CS222 are independent, and each requires only CS122A as their required database background.\r\n\r\n== Prerequisites ==\r\nStudents should have programming experiences in Java, C#, or C++.\r\n\r\n== Textbooks ==\r\n''Database Management Systems'' (3rd Edition) by Raghu Ramakrishnan and Johannes Gehrke, ''a.k.a.'' \"the Cow book\".\r\n\r\n== Exam Schedule ==\r\n=== Midterm Exam ===\r\nTime: April 28, Thursday, in class. Closed books, closed notes.\r\n\r\nHere is a [attachment:CS122aMidtermS14.pdf sample midterm] with [attachment:CS122aS14MidtermSolution.pdf\u200b sample solutions].  Note that topics covered in each quarter might vary. So you may find some questions in the sample midterm not covered during this quarter. So, please conform to this quarter's lectures.\r\n\r\n=== Final Exam ===\r\nTime: Monday, Jun 6,  1:30 - 3:30 p.m. Place: [https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/roomfinder/class.php?ccode=34150&quarter=W16 Schneiderman Lecture Hall, Room 100A].\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Exams, Assignments, and Grading ==\r\n=== Grading Criteria ===\r\nHomework: 40% [[BR]] Quizzes: 5% [[BR]] Midterm: 25% [[BR]] Final: 29% [[BR]]  Participation in EEE Class Evaluation: 1% [[BR]]\r\n\r\n=== Homework ===\r\nHomework assignments must be turned in by the assigned due dates/times on EEE.\r\n\r\n * The official due date for each assignment is listed here on the wiki, and it is expected that students will turn the work in on or before that date.\r\n * We will offer a 24-hour \"grace period\" for each assignment, and will therefore accept submissions turned in within 24 hours of the due date, with a 10-point penalty.  It's 10 points, not 10 percent.  For example, if your late project got 87 points, then your real score will be 87-10=77 points. Notice that EEE will only keep the latest submission. If so you submit or resubmit the assignment after the deadline, it will be considered as a late submission.\r\n * Late assignments will NOT be accepted beyond the grace period, so do always aim to be on time! Please don't even ask, as this is what the 1-day grace period is intended for.\r\n\r\n=== Discussion Sessions ===\r\nThere will also be short weekly quizzes in the discussion session to give you further practice with the course material. Those will count very little towards your final grade. They are mostly a discussion session participation score, and they're really just there for your benefit to give you another opportunity to check your understanding of things.  You will get the full credit for each discussion session if you attend it, or 0 if you are absent.\r\n\r\n=== Grade Change Policy ===\r\nFor all of the graded assignments as well as the midterm exam, if you disagree with the grading, you may discuss your concerns with the relevant staff member within '''1 week''' after they are returned. After that, all grades will be considered final.\r\n\r\n=== Working in Groups ===\r\nWorking together on the assignments is strongly encouraged. You should form groups of ''3 (three)'' students and submit one homework solution per group making sure that the names of all the group members appear on the first page. Work in groups will be graded on a per group basis.\r\n\r\nStudents may leave their existing group in the quarter. But they cannot join any new group after the end of the '''second week'''. For each group splitting, the group members should tell the instructor at least '''1 week''' before the corresponding project/homework deadline.\r\n\r\n=== Policy on Academic Honesty ===\r\nAll students will be expected to adhere to the UCI and ICS Academic Honesty policies (see http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm#academic and http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty to read their details). Any student found to be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means you will fail this course.  Just say ''no'' to cheating!\r\n\r\n----\r\n== DBMS Platform ==\r\nThis class will use an industrial-strength relational database management system (RDBMS) for the hands-on homework assignments, namely MySQL. [[BR]] For information on how to set up and use MySQL, please see: [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-mysql-installation-guide-for-mac.pdf\" \"[MySQL Installation Guide for Mac]\"], [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-mysql-installation-guide-for-windows.pdf\" \"[MySQL Installation Guide for Windows]\"], [attachment:\"sample_script.sql\" \"[Sample SQL Script used in the guide]\"].[[BR]] For information on how to use MySQL Command-Line Tool, please see: [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-mysql-cmdtool-guide-for-mac.pdf\" \"[MySQL Command-Line Tool Guide for Mac]\"], [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-mysql-cmdtool-guide-for-windows.pdf\" \"[MySQL Command-Line Tool Guide for Windows]\"] [attachment:\"createscript.sql\" \"[Sample SQL Script used in the guide]\"].[[BR]]  For further information on how to use the DBMS, please go here: [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/index.html].[[BR]]\r\n\r\n----\r\n== HW Due Dates & Links ==\r\n=== Homework Assignments ===\r\n|| '''Due Date''' || '''Topic''' || '''Assignment''' || '''Solution''' || '''Grading Notes''' || '''TA/Reader to contact''' ||\r\n|| April 14, 11:45 pm || E/R Modeling || [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw1.pdf\" \"[HW 1]\"] [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw1-template.pdf\" \"[Template:PDF]\"] [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw1-template.pptx\" \"[Template:PPT]\"] ||[attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw1-solution.pdf\" \"[HW 1 Solution]\"] ||[attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw1-notes.pdf\" \"[HW1 Grading Notes]\"] || Taewoo Kim ||\r\n|| April 21, 11:45 pm || E/R and Relational Translation ||[attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw2.pdf\" \"[HW 2]\"] [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw2-template.pdf\" \"[Template:PDF]\"] ||[attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw2-solution.pdf\" \"[HW 2 Solution]\"] || || Abdulrahman Alsaudi ||\r\n|| April 28, 11:45 pm || Relational Algebra and SQL query || [attachment:\"2016S-cs122a-hw3.2.pdf\" \"[HW 3]\"] [attachment:\"2016s-cs122a-hw3-template.pdf\" \"[Template:PDF]\"] [attachment:\"HW3_Instructions.pdf\" \"[HW3 Instruction]\"] || [attachment:\"2016S-cs122a-hw3-solution.pdf\" \"[HW 3 Solution]\"]  || || Xikui Wang ||\r\n\r\n=== Discussion Section Quizzes ===\r\n|| '''Week''' || '''Topic''' || '''Quiz''' || '''Solution''' ||\r\n|| Week 1 || Academic honesty || [attachment:\"CS122AS16_quiz_1.pdf\" \"[Quiz 1]\"] || [attachment:\"CS122AS16_quiz_1_solution.pdf\" \"[Solution 1]\"] ||\r\n|| Week 2 || ER diagram basics || [attachment:\"CS122AS16_quiz_2.pdf\" \"[Quiz 2]\"] || [attachment:\"CS122AS16_quiz_2_solution.pdf\" \"[Solution 2]\"] ||\r\n|| Week 3 || No quiz || No quiz || No quiz||\r\n|| Week 4 || Translate ER to SQL || [attachment:\"CS122AS16_quiz_3.pdf\" \"[Quiz 3]\"] || [attachment:\"CS122AS16_quiz_3_solution.pdf\" \"[Solution 3]\"] ||\r\n|| Week 5 || Relational algebra and SQL || [attachment:\"CS122AS16_quiz_4.pdf\" \"[Quiz 4]\"] || [attachment:\"CS122AS16_quiz_4_solution.pdf\" \"[Solution 4]\"] ||", "encoding": "utf-8"}
