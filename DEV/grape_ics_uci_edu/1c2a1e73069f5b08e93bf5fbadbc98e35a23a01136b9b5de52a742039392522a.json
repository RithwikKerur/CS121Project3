Since you are now seniors, and this is your Data Science grand finale, individual initiative and engagement will be expected of all students. The homework assignments may be \"looser\" than what you are used to -- you will have to seek out some of the information needed to complete the assignments and to make  choices about how to attack some of the challenges -- i.e., spoon feeding will be kept to a minimum. The lectures will aim for interactivity, and class participation will be encouraged (and in fact expected).\r\n\r\n=== Academic Honesty Policy ===\r\nStudents will be expected to adhere to the UCI and ICS Academic Honesty policies (see http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm#academic and http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty to read their details). Any student found to somehow be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means that you could fail this course in its entirety. (Ask around - it's happened.)  Just say ''no'' to cheating!\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Software Platform(s) ==\r\nThis course will make use of the Python ecosystem, including the Python language, various Python packages/tools for data analysis and machine learning, Jupyter notebooks, and open source databases (PostgreSQL).  For convenience and package completeness, students are advised to download the most recent Anaconda distribution of Python and friends (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the most recent EDB distribution of PostgreSQL (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Assignment Due Dates & Links ==\r\n\r\n(Be sure to monitor this space carefully as the days and weeks go by!)\r\n\r\n|| '''Assignment''' || '''Due Date''' || '''Topic''' || '''Details''' ||\r\n|| HW 1 || Mon, 1/15  || Schemas and SQL Refresher  || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n|| HW 2 || Mon, 1/22 || Data Wrangling Principles || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n|| HW 3 || Mon, 1/29 || Data Wrangling with Python and Pandas || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n|| HW 4 || Mon, 2/05 || Capturing and Wrangling Twitter Data || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n|| HW 5 || Mon, 2/12 || Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n|| HW 6 || Mon, 2/19 || Taming Tweets with ML and Statistics || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n|| Proj 1 || Mon, 3/07 || Written Project Proposal, Take 1 || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n|| Proj 2 || Mon, 3/12 || Written Project Proposal, Take 2 || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n|| Proj 3 || Wed, 3/14 || Oral Project Proposal || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
