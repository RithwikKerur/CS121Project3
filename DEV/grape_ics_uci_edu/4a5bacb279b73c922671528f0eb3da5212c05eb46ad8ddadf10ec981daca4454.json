Details of how to turn in a given assignment will be included in each assignment's handout. The 40% of your grade attributed to homework will be based on your ''top 7 out of 8'' homework scores. (You can spend the 8th one however you like, but if you decide to skip an assignment, do keep in mind that the material will still be on the exam and that the homework is intended to be a useful study/practice tool.) There will also be short weekly quizzes in the discussion sections to give you further practice with the course material; those will count relatively little towards your final grade (they're essentially a discussion section participation score), and they're just there for your benefit (to give you another chance to check your understanding of things and see what questions you might want to ask the TA). We will also drop your lowest quiz score when grading.\r\n\r\nIt should go without saying, but we will say it here anyway: Note that these points are entirely under your control!  If you wish or need to maximize your grade, it should be obvious that you should turn in all of the HW assignments on time and attend all of the Discussion sessions. It is \"your choice\" whether or not to do so. (There will be zero end-of-quarter sympathy for students whose grades are lower than they would have liked due to late points or missed Discussions! Your fate is in your own hands!) One missed discussion or one late HW will not kill you - that's why the quiz points are small and one HW score is dropped - but you should save those options for emergencies (if at all).\r\n\r\n=== Grade Change Policy ===\r\nFor all of the graded assignments as well as the Midterm exam, if you disagree with the grading, you may discuss your concerns with the relevant instructor (professor, TA, or reader) within two weeks after they are returned. After that, all grades will be considered final. Instructors' office hours are the best time/place to handle these issues (or you can make a separate appointment). Do not wait until the end of the term to raise issues, as two weeks really means two weeks.\r\n\r\n=== Collaboration Policy ===\r\nAll homework assignments are to be completed ''individually''. It is okay to discuss assignments with your peers, e.g., to clarify details of an assignment or to compare thoughts on rough approaches, but the details of your work are to be done solo.  See http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty for a good discussion of what is/isn't considered honest collaboration.  The exams are also to be done solo. :-)\r\n\r\n=== Late Policy ===\r\nDue dates will be clearly indicated on all HW assignments. Most assignments will still be accepted for up to '''two days''' after the due date, but you will lose 20 points per day (out of the 100-point total per assignment) for any lateness. We will not accept assignments in any form whatsoever after that time. \"Stuff happens\" sometimes, as we all know, so you should anticipate that reality and try to avoid working up until the very last minute. Assignments MUST be turned in per the assignment's instructions by the indicated deadline date/time in order to get full credit.  (Note:  The best-7-out-of-8 grading policy is another fallback plan for what would otherwise be late homework assignments; that will work once, but obviously only once.)\r\n\r\n=== Exam Attendance Policy ===\r\nThe exam dates are provided at the start of the term. These dates are not flexible and makeup exams will not be offered, so please avoid scheduling job interviews, trips, or any other activities in ways that interfere with exam-taking. All students are required to take the exam on the *same* date in the *same* time window in order to ensure that we can give, grade, and fairly curve the entire class on a single exam offering.  (Thanks!)\r\n\r\n=== Academic Honesty Policy ===\r\nCheating is the one area where the instructor for this course has ''zero'' patience or sympathy. You are here at UCI to learn, and cheating totally defeats that purpose. All students will be expected to adhere to the UCI and ICS Academic Honesty policies (see http://www.editor.uci.edu/catalogue/appx/appx.2.htm#academic and http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty to read their details). Any student found to be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means that you could fail this course in its entirety. (Ask around - it's happened.)  Just say ''no'' to cheating!!!\r\n\r\n----\r\n== DBMS Platform ==\r\nThis class will use an industrial-strength relational database management system (RDBMS) for the hands-on homework assignments. In some past terms we have allowed students to choose between MySQL (an open source DBMS), DB2 (from IBM), and/or another RDBMS of their choosing. This quarter we will be suggesting that everyone use the same system, namely MySQL, for better or for worse.\r\n\r\nFor information on how to set up and use MySQL, please see: [attachment:\"2017s-cs122a-mysql-installation-guide-for-mac.pdf\" \"[MySQL Installation Guide for Mac]\"], [attachment:\"2017s-cs122a-mysql-installation-guide-for-windows.pdf\" \"[MySQL Installation Guide for Windows]\"], [attachment:\"sample_script.sql\" \"[Sample SQL Script used in the guide]\"].[[BR]] For information on how to use MySQL Command-Line Tool, please see: [attachment:\"2017s-cs122a-mysql-cmdtool-guide-for-mac.pdf\" \"[MySQL Command-Line Tool Guide for Mac]\"], [attachment:\"2017s-cs122a-mysql-cmdtool-guide-for-windows.pdf\" \"[MySQL Command-Line Tool Guide for Windows]\"] [attachment:\"createscript.sql\" \"[Sample SQL Script used in the guide]\"].[[BR]]  For further information on how to use the DBMS, you can look here: [https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/index.html].[[BR]]\r\n\r\nIf you have a strong preference for using another database system for the course project, e.g., because you are working elsewhere on- or off-campus with a different RDBMS (e.g., SQL Server), you may e-mail the Instructor with a request for permission to do so. If you opt to do this, you will then be on your own to make sure everything works right within the prescribed timeframes (i.e., DBMS difficulties will not be accepted as a lateness excuse).\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Discussion Forums for All Things CS122A ==\r\nWe will be using Piazza for online class discussions. The system is catered to getting you the help you need fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, the Reader, and the Instructor. Rather than emailing your course or HW content questions to the teaching staff, you will be expected to post your questions on Piazza. (If you have any problems or feedback for the Piazza developers, email team@piazza.com.)  We've used Piazza for this class multiple times before, and it seems to work remarkably well. You can find our class Piazza page at: [http://piazza.com/uci/Spring2017/cs122a]. There are two things we'll ask you to keep in mind in terms of Piazza:  First, before you post a new question, you are expected to have skimmed the existing questions and answers in order to avoid posting questions that were already asked and answered. Second, please avoid posting homework \"specifics\", e.g., \"Here is my answer to question 5b, what did others answer?\" - otherwise you will risk violating the course's Collaboration Policy. Thanks!\r\n\r\nAs you are aware, there is also a weekly Discussion session meeting, and attendance of those is highly encouraged. This encouragement is provided via the quiz portion of your final grade (5%), as quizzes can only be taken in person during the Discussion session.  Because of the class size, and limited Discussion room space, everyone must attend the session in which you are enrolled; you can only attend a different (e.g., earlier or later) session with prior one-time permission from the TAs, and should only due so because of an unavoidable one-time \"issue\". Note that you will be held responsible for the material discussed in the Discussion sessions, so if you opt out or miss one, be sure to ask a trusted classmate who's been to theirs what you might need to know. The Discussion sessions will also serve as \"group office hours\" - we will leave ample time for questions most weeks, so come armed with things you'd like to have clarified or expanded on.\r\n\r\n----\r\n== HW Due Dates & Links ==\r\n=== Homework Assignments ===\r\n|| '''Due Date''' || '''Topic''' || '''Assignment''' || '''Solution''' || '''Grading Notes''' ||\r\n|| Fri, Apr 14 (6 PM) || E-R Modeling || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Td-qCSaqHxKH5vSIWi0gJdeJ0DPt72phw8FUNGwdwPw/edit?usp=sharing HW 1] [https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1py_iC4AFqcW_GGgD6meqi7aMlTur3xE8EdR_VyGpRGs/edit?usp=sharing TMPL] || [attachment:\"2017s-cs122a-hw1-solution-release.pdf\" HW 1 Solution] || [HW 1 Grading Notes] ||\r\n|| Fri, Apr 21 (6 PM) || E-R to Relational Translation || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZZHAJiSotuPZCYqQ5LiTraJ9vQxXvoAG2HlwD9YC3M/edit?usp=sharing HW 2] [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ow74drQWolIbzqSOm2-PWALOffPcT405jhpTECCUx9o/edit?usp=sharing TMPL] || HW 2 Solution: [attachment:\"2017s-cs122a-hw2-solution-release.pdf\" PDF] [attachment:\"2017s-cs122a-hw2-solution-release.txt\" TXT] || [HW 2 Grading Notes] ||\r\n|| Fri, Apr 28 (6 PM) || Relational Design Theory || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PwFLO62arZAP6UNRMUmuTrEPdHBAtgwp5_6Sqps6NHk/edit?usp=sharing HW 3] [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EduSV89q4WAwx33EOpao-gHsr93t_YI9I2m4jfi4Pt0/edit?usp=sharing TMPL] || [attachment:\"2017s-cs122a-hw3-solution.pdf\" HW 3 Solution] || [HW 3 Grading Notes] ||\r\n|| Fri, May 5 (6 PM) || Relational Algebra and Calculus || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jvy51143w4xCAPB4XHPz3VoKFuMSYi8M372gpu2q3gk/edit?usp=sharing HW 4] [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LMhLbUQvM5znRbPro__1yiAjz-wrGfaiyQJBrAifyxE/edit?usp=sharing TMPL] [attachment:HW4_Instruction-release.pdf INST] || [attachment:2017s-cs122a-hw4-solution.pdf HW 4 Solution] || [HW 4 Grading Notes] ||\r\n|| Thu, May 18 (6 PM) || Structured Query Language (SQL) || [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xJ0_Kpl3ohdiSTYQCUuzebg8DIEPDCv5VafdpPnuepI HW 5] [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xjuchiWZQeP5xs-LKooA5o0iL1xf_RxvL_gnlWD-4KE INST] [attachment:HW5_Dataset-release.sql SCRIPT] || [attachment:2017s-cs122a-hw5-Solution-release.pdf HW 5 Solution] || [HW 5 Grading Notes] ||\r\n|| Fri, May 26 (6 PM) || More SQL (Hands-on) || [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZpbJamm1_MrVmQYr5x1vaigmkx4XEOq83KU7JBA0MlY HW 6] [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O8Oxpg14DQWiZa7q3_oN1LXDb-tBHenZzoU1yAT0MVk/edit?usp=sharing INST] [attachment:HW6_Dataset.sql SCRIPT] [attachment:hw6_sample_script.sql Sample Script] || [attachment:2017s-cs122a-hw6-solution-release.pdf HW 6 Solution] || [HW 6 Grading Notes] ||\r\n|| Fri, June 2 (6 PM) || SQL Design and Indexing || [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1To4VtXMuVkiJPaay5hYXTAgq47AgtiKzX_SUZbddvXY HW 7] [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Al7aehmdqLo-JWsFqs40yeWK1lP5Wgfpz6xhrwx12OA TMPL] || [attachment:2017s-cs122a-hw7-solution-release.pdf HW 7 Solution] || [HW 7 Grading Notes] ||\r\n|| Fri, June 9 (6 PM) || NoSQL (Hands-on) || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Fmahqo_9OZzV0PvcLXjc4RCgYt6GTVZtudZNLyH3jsY/edit?usp=sharing HW 8]  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MRFipZEtAL1GyJ5lDH_uzouujjEB-8EXjKUQJz4LY54/edit?usp=sharing TMPL] [attachment:\"RunAsterixDB.pdf\" \" >First_Step<\"] [attachment:\"HW8_TableInit.txt\" \"TableInit\"] [attachment:\"HW8_DataInit.txt\" \"DataInit\"]  || [attachment:2017s-cs122a-hw8-solution-release.pdf HW 8 Solution] || [HW 8 Grading Notes] ||", "encoding": "ascii"}
