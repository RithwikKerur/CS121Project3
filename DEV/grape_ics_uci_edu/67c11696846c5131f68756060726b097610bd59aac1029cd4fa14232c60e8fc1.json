It has several important components to support search. The engine consists of several modules, where the \"Document store\" module is already provided.  Throughout the quarter we will develop the modules one by one. For each of them, we will define the API, and students are required to implement the API.  Each student team will also submit your own test cases.\r\n\r\nThe development of each project consists of three phrases:\r\n\r\n- Phrase 1: We will provide the API;\r\n- Phrase 2 (5 days): Students will design and implement their module, and submit test cases;\r\n- Phrase 3 (before the deadline): Students will provide comments on the published test cases, and continue their implementation. You will provide peer comments and suggestions on the test cases to make sure they are all correct.  The goal is to pass all the test cases before submitting the project.  Notice that the development of the module should start in Phrase 2 in order to finish the work before the deadline.\r\n\r\n|| Project || Topic || Days || Due Date || Weight || Grading Rubrics || \r\n|| 0 || DS: Document store (provided) || || || || || \r\n|| 1 || TA: Text analyzers (stemming and tokenization) || || || || || \r\n|| 2 || II: Inverted index, boolean search || || || || || \r\n|| 3 || PI: Positional index, phrase search || || || || || \r\n|| 4 || RA: Ranking || || || || || ||\r\n\r\n\r\n== Course Information ==\r\n\r\n=== Overview ===\r\nThis course exposes students to principal concepts related to information retrieval, including text analyzers (e.g., stemming and tokenization), text indexing, inverted index, search (boolean expressions, phrase search), and ranking.  It will also cover topics of Web search and vertical search, with related techniques such as crawling and search engine optimization. A significant part of the course is to implement a search engine using Java.\r\n\r\n=== Prerequisites ===\r\n\r\nJava programming; data structures and algorithms.\r\n\r\n=== Grading Breakdown ===\r\nProjects: 76% [[BR]] Final: 20% [[BR]] Class participation: 3% [[BR]] EEE Class Evaluation: 1% [[BR]]\r\n\r\nFor all the graded projects and exams, if you disagree with the grading, you can discuss with us within '''two weeks''' after they are returned. After that, all the grades will be finalized.\r\n\r\n=== Class participation ===\r\n\r\nStudents need to actively participate in the lectures.  Before each lecture, the instructor will come up with initial slides using Google slides.  We will assign a group of students to each lecture (except the first one) who will be responsible to keep notes during the lecture.  If needed, they can take pictures, but no photos including the lecturer please :-)  Within two days after the lecture, the assigned students will modify the initial slides and add more.  After that, the whole class, including the lecturer, will give improvement comments and suggestions within one week,  which should be taken care of by the group.  3% of the overall grade of the assigned students will be based on the quality of the final slides.\r\n\r\n=== Textbooks ===\r\n\r\nIntroduction to Information Retrieval, Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan and Hinrich Sch\u00c3\u00bctze, Cambridge University Press. 2008, [https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html Book Site], [https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookprint.pdf PDF].\r\n\r\n=== Using Github ===\r\n[TODO] You are required to use Github to manage your source code.  Here are the [https://grape.ics.uci.edu/wiki/public/wiki/cs122b-2019-winter-project1-git instructions].\r\n\r\n=== Working in Groups ===\r\nWorking together on projects is '''strongly encouraged'''. You can form groups of no more than ''2 (two)'' students and submit one homework solution per group making sure that the names of all the group members appear on the first page. Work in groups will be graded on a per group basis.\r\n\r\nStudents may leave their existing group in the quarter. But they cannot join any new group after the end of the '''second week'''. For each group splitting, the group members should tell the instructor at least '''two weeks''' before the corresponding project/homework deadline. From the previous quarters, we saw quite a few students who worked alone first but found out the workload was much higher than they initially expected. Thus, please seize the opportunity of the first two weeks to find good teammates to work together.\r\n\r\n=== Award ===\r\nThe top 1 student who made the most contributions to Piazza (e.g., providing high-quality answers, decided by the staff) will receive 1% extra credit on the overall grade.\r\n\r\n=== Project Late Policy ===\r\n * The official due date for each assignment is listed here on the wiki, and it is expected that students will turn the work in on or before that date.\r\n * We will offer a '''24-hour grace period''' for each assignment, and will therefore accept submissions turned in within 24 hours of the due date, with a 10-point penalty. It's 10 points, not 10 percent. For example, if your late project got 87 points, then your real score will be 87-10=77 points. Notice that EEE will only keep the latest submission. If so you submit or resubmit the project after the deadline, it will be considered as a late submission.\r\n * Late assignments will NOT be accepted beyond the grace period, so do always aim to be on time! Please don't even ask, as this is what the 1-day grace period is intended for.\r\n\r\n=== Policy on Academic Honesty ===\r\nAll students will be expected to adhere to the UCI and ICS Academic Honesty policies (see [http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty] to read their details). Any student found to be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means you will fail this course. Just say ''no'' to cheating!\r\n", "encoding": "ISO-8859-1"}
