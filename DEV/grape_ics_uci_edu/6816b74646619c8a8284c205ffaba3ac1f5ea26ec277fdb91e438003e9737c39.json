Failure to follow the instructions could make your project unable to build on our machines, which may result in loss of points.\r\n\r\n2. Project Report (10%)\r\n * Clearly document the design of your project (the record format, the page format, the page format in the file, and the meta-data) using the template file that we have provided.\r\n * Explain the implementation of important functions such as updateTuple and deleteTuple.\r\n\r\n3.
