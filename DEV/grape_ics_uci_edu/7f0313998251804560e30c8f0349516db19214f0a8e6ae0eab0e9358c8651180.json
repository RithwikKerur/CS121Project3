We will soon switch to Piazza for class announcements.\r\n\r\n- Form a team to do project 1.  Specify your team members on the spreadsheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F9KZHjk9RjoRd4yIIu9rdiHXHFBSNOVGGAkoqX0VcVo/edit .  A team of size 3 is highly recommended.  No matter what the size is, please fill in the information there.\r\n\r\n- The spreadsheet has a tab for people looking for partners.\r\n\r\n- Project 1 will be due on 1/18/2017, Wednesday.  Start on it soon.  You will do your submission as a team, and each team only needs one submission.\r\n\r\n- Setup your development environment on your laptop (Java, Eclipse, MySQL, JDBC, and Tomcat).\r\n\r\n- Set up an AWS account.  Apply for free credits at https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/.\r\n\r\n- Start a Ubuntu 64-bit instance (free tier) and follow our instructions to setup the environment on the instance.  Make sure to configure the security group to make it safe.  Also \"Stop\" the instance when you are not using it.\r\n\r\nGiven the nature of this project-oriented course, our deadline to drop the class is by the end this Friday.  After that, you are in!\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
