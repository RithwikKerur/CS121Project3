IntelliJ is needed because a library we use is written in Kotlin, which has built-in support in IntelliJ.\r\n\r\n== Join Github Organization and create a repo for your team ==\r\nThis course uses Github for version control, submitting final code, submitting test cases and reviews. The students are expected to use Github as explained below.\r\n\r\n * Create an account on Github if you don't have one. Then provide us your username in the  [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_iwJOT-bnYDk9tWNNy61GCyi1kRN7s3VHdn5h_2T1DA/edit?usp=sharing Google Spreadsheet].\r\n * Wait for the invitation from our staff to join the [https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching UCI-Chenli-teaching organization]. The invitation might take a few days to be sent out based on our schedule.\r\n * One member from each team needs to create a '''private''' repository. The repository name should be of the form 'cs221-spring19-team-x' where 'x' is your assigned team number, e.g., \"cs221-spring19-team-1\". Other members can then be added to the repository as collaborators (by following steps given [https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/ here]).\r\n * You must wait for the invitation from us and '''create a private repository within the organization UCI-Chenli-teaching'''. Don't create a private repository on your own. 1) Go to [https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching UCI-Chenli-teaching organization]. 2) click the '''New''' button to create a repository. 3) Type in the name and choose '''private'''.\r\n\r\nWe have a [https://grape.ics.uci.edu/wiki/public/wiki/cs221-2019-spring-project1-git wiki] to get you started with Github for this course. Go through one of these online tutorials to get familiar with Git and Github if you are not familiar with them.\r\n * https://try.github.io\r\n * https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners\r\n\r\n\r\n= Coding Tasks =\r\n\r\n== Task 1: Implement a simple tokenizer based on punctuations and white spaces (3 points) ==\r\n\r\nImplement this tokenizer in `analysis/PunctuationTokenizer.java`\r\n\r\nFor example: the text `I am Happy Today!` should be tokenized to `[\"happy\", \"today\"]`.\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n - White spaces (space, tab, newline, etc..) and punctuations provided by us should be used to tokenize the text.\r\n - White spaces and punctuations should be removed from the result tokens.\r\n - All tokens should be converted to lower case.\r\n - Stop words should be filtered out. Use the stop word list provided in `StopWords.java`.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Task 2: Implement a Dynamic-Programming based Word-Break Tokenizer (7 points) ==\r\n\r\nWord break is a problem where given a dictionary and a string (text with all white spaces removed), determine how to break the string into a sequence of words.\r\nImplement this tokenizer in `analysis/PunctuationTokenizer.java`. As an example, an input string `\"catdog\"` should be broken to tokens `[\"cat\", \"dog\"]`.\r\n\r\nUse frequency statistics to choose the optimal way when there are many alternatives to break a string. For example:\r\n{{{\r\ninput string is \"ai\",\r\ndictionary and probability is: `\"a\": 0.1, \"i\": 0.1, and \"ai\": \"0.05\"`\r\n\r\nAlternative 1: [\"a\", \"i\"], with probability p(\"a\") * p(\"i\") = 0.01\r\nAlternative 2: [\"ai\"], with probability p(\"ai\") = 0.05\r\nFinally, [\"ai\"] is chosen as result because it has higher probability.\r\n}}}\r\n\r\nWe provide an English dictionary corpus with frequency information in \"resources/cs221_frequency_dictionary_en.txt\".\r\n\r\nRequirements:\r\n - Use Dynamic Programming for efficiency purposes.\r\n - Use the given dictionary corpus and frequency statistics to determine an optimal alternative.\r\n     The probability is calculated as the product of each token's probability, assuming the tokens are independent.\r\n - A match in the dictionary is case insensitive. Output tokens should all be in lower case.\r\n - Stop words should be removed.\r\n - If there's no possible way to break the string, throw an exception.\r\n\r\n\r\n== Task 3: Incorporate a Porter stemmer (2 points) ==\r\n\r\nStemming is the process of reducing a word into its \"stem\" (\"root\") form.\r\n\r\nPorter stemming is a classic and popular algorithm that uses a set of rules and steps to process a token.\r\nWe ask you to incorporate the following existing Porter stemmer implementation into this project:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/lucene-solr/blob/master/lucene/analysis/common/src/java/org/apache/lucene/analysis/en/PorterStemmer.java\r\n\r\n\r\n== Task 4:  Implement a dynamic-programming based Chinese or Japanese tokenizer (Optional Extra Credit, 3 points) ==\r\n\r\nTokenizing Chinese or Japanese text is challenging because there are no explicit spaces between words. It is very similar to the word-break problem in task 2.\r\n\r\nUse the same dictionary-frequency and dynamic programming based algorithm in task 2 to implement a Chinese or Japanese Tokenizer. For fairness, you must choose a language that is NOT your native language.\r\n\r\nYou need to find a Chinese or Japanese dictionary corpus with frequency information on your own, and write at least 3 test cases to test the correctness of your tokenizer.\r\n\r\n= Testing Tasks =\r\n\r\n== Task: Submitting Test Cases (3 points) ==\r\n\r\nFor this project, we require each team to submit at least 2 test cases. We expect you to write high-quality test cases, and grade will be based on the correctness, quality, and documentation. \r\n\r\nEach team will be assigned to write test cases for 1 specific task (Punctuation-based Tokenizer, or Word Break Tokenizer, or Porter Stemmer). Check the Google Spreadsheet (TO BE FILLED) to see on which task your team should write tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test cases should follow these general guidelines:\r\n1. Create a new class under the corresponding package in `test/java/edu.uci.ics.cs221/...`. The class name should follow the naming convention `Team#TaskNameTest`. \r\n2. Write tests using the JUnit testing framework. Use `Assert` functions from the Junit framework.\r\n3. Each test case should be independent of each other. JUnit runs test cases in an arbitrary order.\r\n4. Each test case should have informative comments.\r\n\r\nThe test cases should be submitted via Github Pull Requests, to submit a test case:\r\n1. '''fork''' the [https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/spring19-cs221-project spring19-cs221-project] into your own Github account. Clone your fork into your local machine.\r\n1. In your own fork repo, go to \"settings -> Collaborators\", add the TA \"zuozhiw AT gmail DOT com\" as a collaborator.\r\n1. Add the test cases, commit, and push to your own fork's master branch.\r\n1. In your own fork repo, click \"Pull request\" and open a pull request to merge into the original repo `UCI-Chenli-teaching/spring19-cs221-project`.\r\n1. Follow the title and content of the [https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/spring19-cs221-project/pull/1 template pull request]\r\n\r\n\r\n== Task: Peer Review Test Cases (2 points) ==\r\n\r\nFor this project, we require each team to review 2 other teams' test cases after the test cases are submitted. The reviewers need to leave comments under the Github Pull Requests to discuss problems or suggestions with the authors, and approve the pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
