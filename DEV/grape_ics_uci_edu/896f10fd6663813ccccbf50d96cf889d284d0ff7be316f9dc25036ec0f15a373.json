Any student found to somehow be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means that you could fail this course in its entirety. (Ask around - it's happened.)  Just say ''no'' to cheating!\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Software Platform(s) ==\r\nThis class will make use of the Python ecosystem, including the Python language, popular modules/tools for Python data analysis and machine learning, Jupyter notebooks, \r\n\r\n----\r\n== HW Due Dates & Links ==\r\n=== Homework Assignments ===\r\n|| '''Due Date''' || '''Topic''' || '''Assignment''' ||\r\n|| Fri, Jan (6 PM) || Database Cobweb Removal  || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
