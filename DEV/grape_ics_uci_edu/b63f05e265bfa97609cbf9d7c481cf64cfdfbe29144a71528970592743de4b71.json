I have listened to this CD for YEARS and I still LOVE IT. When I'm in a good mood it makes me feel better. A bad mood just evaporates like sugar in the rain. This CD just oozes LIFE. Vocals are jusat STUUNNING and lyrics just kill. One of life's hidden gems. This is a desert isle CD in my book. Why she never made it big is just beyond me. Everytime I play this, no matter black, white, young, old, male, female EVERYBODY says one thing \"Who was that singing ?\"\nOne of the best game music soundtracks - for a game I didn't really play: Despite the fact that I have only played a small portion of the game, the music I heard (plus the connection to Chrono Trigger which was great as well) led me to purchase the soundtrack, and it remains one of my favorite albums. There is an incredible mix of fun, epic, and emotional songs. Those sad and beautiful tracks I especially like, as there's not too many of those kinds of songs in my other video game soundtracks. I must admit that one of the songs (Life-A Distant Promise) has brought tears to my eyes on many occasions.My one complaint about this soundtrack is that they use guitar fretting effects in many of the songs, which I find distracting. But even if those weren't included I would still consider the collection worth it.\nBatteries died within a year ...: I bought this charger in Jul 2003 and it worked OK for a while. The design is nice and convenient. However, after about a year, the batteries would not hold a charge. Might as well just get alkaline disposables, or look elsewhere for a charger that comes with batteries that have better staying power.\nworks fine, but Maha Energy is better: Check out Maha Energy's website. Their Powerex MH-C204F charger works in 100 minutes for rapid charge, with option for slower charge (better for batteries). And they have 2200 mAh batteries.\nGreat for the non-audiophile: Reviewed quite a bit of the combo players and was hesitant due to unfavorable reviews and size of machines. I am weaning off my VHS collection, but don't want to replace them with DVD. This unit is well built, easy to setup and resolution and special effects (no progressive scan for HDTV owners) suitable for many people looking for a versatile product.Cons- No universal remote.\nDVD Player crapped out after one year: I also began having the incorrect disc problems that I've read about on here. The VCR still works, but hte DVD side is useless. I understand that DVD players sometimes just quit on you, but after not even one year? To me that's a sign on bad quality. I'm giving up JVC after this as well. I'm sticking to Sony or giving another brand a shot.\nIncorrect Disc: I love the style of this, but after a couple years, the DVD is giving me problems. It doesn't even work anymore and I use my broken PS2 Now. I wouldn't recommend this, I'm just going to upgrade to a recorder now. I wish it would work but I guess i'm giving up on JVC. I really did like this one... before it stopped working. The dvd player gave me problems probably after a year of having it.\nDVD menu select problems: I cannot scroll through a DVD menu that is set up vertically. The triangle keys will only select horizontally. So I cannot select anything on most DVD's besides play. No special features, no language select, nothing, just play.\nUnique Weird Orientalia from the 1930's: Exotic tales of the Orient from the 1930's. \"Dr Shen Fu\", a Weird Tales magazine reprint, is about the elixir of life that grants immortality at a price. If you're tired of modern authors who all sound alike, this is the antidote for you. Owen's palette is loaded with splashes of Chinese and Japanese colours. Marvelous.\nNot an \"ultimate guide\": Firstly,I enjoyed the format and tone of the book (how the author addressed the reader). However, I did not feel that she imparted any insider secrets that the book promised to reveal. If you are just starting to research law school, and do not know all the requirements of admission, then this book may be a tremendous help. If you have done your homework and are looking for an edge when it comes to admissions, I recommend some more topic-specific books. For example, books on how to write your personal statment, books geared specifically towards LSAT preparation (Powerscore books were the most helpful for me), and there are some websites with great advice geared towards aiding the individuals whom you are asking to write letters of recommendation. Yet, for those new to the entire affair, this book can definitely clarify the requirements for you.\nGreat book for travelling Europe: I currently live in Europe, and this is the book I recommend for my visitors. It covers many countries, colour pictures, and is a nice starter for before you go, and once you are there.\nNot!: If you want to listen to El Duke , then it is better if you have access to his shower,this is not him, it is a gimmick,very well orchestrated.\nA complete Bust: This game requires quicktime 5.0 to work...if you have a better version of quicktime (I have 7.5), it will ask you to install the quicktime available on the CD...if you click no, it will not let you play. So, I begrudgingly clicked yes on the third try, and it installed quicktime 5, THEN it tells me to please install the quicktime available on the disc. It KEPT telling me that, even after I uninstalled my version of quicktime 7.5, and reinstalled Barbie Rapunzel and quicktime 5. Very frustrating, and the game absolutely will not work for me. It keeps telling me over and over, to install quicktime 5, tho I've been through the installation process repeatedly. It is NOT my \"operating system limitations\". This is a brand new computer...merely weeks old with all the state of the art contraptions.\nTRULY MADE A DIFFERENCE!: I have been using this product for a couple years now. I started using it because my hair had gotten so dry from all the chemical treatments and relaxers. This actualy came in the relaxer kit. I tried it and could not beleive the difference it made with one use. I could not find it in any of the stores at the time so I searched Amazon and they had it. I absolutely love it. It is the best moisturizing product I have used so far. My hair is soft with good elasticity and it is not breaking anywhere close to what it was. I am very happy with it.\nI didn't run off of USB bus power: Was hoping that this drive would run off of bus power, but it required the adapter to actually work. :( I sent it back.\nDon't buy!: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!\nSimple, Durable, Fun game for all ages: This is an AWESOME game! Almost everyone know tic-tac-toe so it is EASY to learn and quick to play. You can't play just once! The twist is that your pieces are slightly different sizes - just big enough to gobble up your opponent. The first person to make tic-tac-toe wins, but it's not as easy as it looks when you're stuck in the mindset of just making three in a row and forget about the gobbling possibilities! My 4 and 5 year olds will beat me even when I'm trying to win! Excellent beginning critical thinking game. Grandparents loved playing it with the kids too.\nReview of Kelly Club for Toddlers: For the price of 7.99, this PC game is WELL worth it, great graphics, colorful and lots to do! My four year old daughter is in love with the many tasks to complete in this game, including dressing and grooming wide variety of pets and decoration of numerous floats to show in your little one's very own parade.\nDon't like it: This product smells when you open the package and it appears one of the gel cushions leaks so I spent $10 and haven't worn then. I wouldn't buy this product again. Don't waste your money on something you may not be able to use.\none of the last in the series to collect !: The magazine was in very good condition and had the usual high standard of articles and photos that Victoria magazine has come to represent. I have collected all the previous magazines of the series and still enjoy leafing through them on a rainy day", "encoding": "UTF-8-SIG"}
