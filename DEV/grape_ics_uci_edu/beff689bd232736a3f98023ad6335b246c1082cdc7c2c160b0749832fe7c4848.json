Whenever you have the question \"why doesn't my application work?\", the first thing you should do is to use the logging of MySQL and Tomcat to understand what each tier has received, and whether there is any error. This page provides instructions on how to enable and analyze logging of MySQL and Tomcat, on both the development machine and the production/AWS machine.\r\n\r\n----\r\n= 1. Apache Tomcat Logging (Dev machine + Eclipse) =\r\n* After Eclipse starts, go to the '''Servers''' view in Eclipse show as below:\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-logging:server-view.png)]]\r\n\r\n* Double-click the Tomcat server you're running. You will find a window like the image below:\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-logging:eclipse-server-overview.png)]]\r\n\r\n* Click on the blue link: '''Open launch configuration''' and you will find a dialog window like the image below.\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-logging:launch-configuration.png)]]\r\n\r\n* Click on '''Arguments''' section. Log files are stored in the folder {{{logs}}} of the path {{{-Dcatalina.base}}}.\r\n\r\n* Change the directory to that folder and monitor the files to see how they change as your browser sends requests to Tomcat.  In a Linux-like environment (e.g., Ubuntu or MacOS), you can run the following command : {{{tail -f *}}}.\r\n\r\n----\r\n= 2. Apache Tomcat Logging (AWS) =\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n= 3. MySQL Logging on AWS =\r\n* For MySQL (version > 5.6), to enable logging, you can add the following block to MySQL's configuration file: `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`.\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n# Edit MySQL configuration file and update following setting under [mysqld].\r\n[mysqld]\r\n\r\n# To enable general logs in MySQL or to change location of general log files.\r\n# This file contains all general logs of mysql server for eg: queries, user connect or disconnect etc.\r\ngeneral_log_file   = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log\r\ngeneral_log        = 1\r\n\r\n# To Enable MySQL error log or change MySQL error log location.\r\n# This file contains error generated in MySQL server.\r\nlog_error = /var/log/mysql/error.log\r\n\r\n# To enable or change file path of MySQL slow query logs.\r\n# This file contains logs of those queries which is taking more time to complete.\r\n# Which queries taking time more than defined as long_query_time are logged.\r\n#log_slow_queries    = /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log\r\n#long_query_time     = 2\r\n}}}\r\n\r\n* Create the following three files using commands shown below:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nsudo touch /var/log/mysql/mysql.log\r\n\r\nsudo touch /var/log/mysql/error.log\r\n\r\nsudo touch /var/log/mysql/mysql-slow.log\r\n}}}\r\n\r\n* After making any of the above changes in MySQL configuration, You must have to '''restart MySQL services''' to apply changes: {{{sudo service mysql restart}}}.\r\n\r\n----\r\n= 4. MySQL Logging on Dev =\r\n* Change the corresponding MySQL configuration file as we do for AWS on your development machine\r\n\r\n* Create the corresponding log files under the directories specified in the MySQL configuration file.\r\n\r\n* Restart MySQL server on your development machine to apply the changes.\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
