Submit on EEE.'''[[BR]]Notice that we use 1 day after the official deadline as the submission cut-off time on EEE to allow you to use the 24-hour grace period if you chose so. After that, EEE will no longer accept submissions.\r\n\r\n= Tasks =\r\n 1. (Optional) [#RegisterDomain Register a domain name for Fabflix]\r\n 1. [#reCAPTCHA Adding reCAPTCHA to Project 2]\r\n 1. [#HTTPS Adding HTTPS to Project 2]\r\n 1. [#Dashboard Implementing a Dashboard using Stored Procedure]\r\n 1. [#XMLParsing Importing large XML data files into the Fabflix database]\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[Span(id=RegisterDomain)]]\r\n\r\n== Task 1 (Optional): Register a domain name for Fabflix ==\r\nIf you are tired of using an IP address to visit your AWS instance and want to make it \"real,\" you can register a domain name from a registrar company such as [http://godaddy.com Godaddy]. Then use the AWS instance to do the hosting. Now we are open for real business!\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[Span(id=reCAPTCHA)]]\r\n\r\n== Task 2: Adding reCAPTHA to Project 2 ==\r\nImprove the user-authentication process of project 2 by adding a module that verifies real users and blocks bots.\r\n\r\n 1. Download and deploy [attachment:wiki:cs122b-2017-spring-project3:TomcatFormReCaptcha.war TomcatFormReCaptcha.war].\r\n 1. Get a [https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html reCAPTCHA] from Google. Use the public IP of your AWS instance as the domain. You will get a ''secret key'' and a ''site key''.\r\n 1. Follow the instructions on the page shown in step 2 to modify the file \"webapps/TomcatFormReCaptcha/index.html\" or \"webapps/TomcatFormReCaptcha/index-invisible.html\" depending on version of reCAPTCHA you choose(regular vs. invisible) . In particular, use your own \"site key\" to replace the \"data-sitekey\" value. '''Note:''' if you choose to use the invisible version, you have to replace ''index.html'' with content from ''index-invisible.html''\r\n 1. Test the page http://YOUR_IP:8080/TomcatFormReCaptcha to see if reCAPTHA works for the front end (You should get an error saying \"Recaptcha WRONG!!!!\" if you followed the instructions properly)\r\n 1. Read and understand the file \"sources/TomcatFormReCaptcha.java\", especially the logic related to verifying \"g-recaptcha-response\". Also modify the file \"!MyConstants.java\" to use your own \"SITE_KEY\" and \"SECRET_KEY\" values.\r\n 1. Recompile the Java files and reload the app using the Tomcat console. Test if the backend of reCAPTHA is working properly.\r\n 1. Apply the same logic to your project 2 by making the necessary changes on the login frontend and backend logic.\r\n\r\n[[Span(id=HTTPS)]]\r\n\r\n== Task 3: Adding HTTPS to Project 2 ==\r\nSee this [http://tecadmin.net/configure-ssl-certificate-in-tomcat/ reference] on how to configure Tomcat to enable HTTPS connections.\r\n\r\nStep 1: On your AWS instance, use the following command to create a keystore to be used by Tomcat. Remember what password you use for the keystore. Our example uses \"changeit\".\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nsudo keytool -genkey -alias fabflix -keyalg RSA -keystore /etc/tomcat8.5/keystore\r\n}}}\r\nStep 2: Uncomment the `Connector` tag in `/etc/tomcat8.5/server.xml`, which has port=\"8443\" and defines an SSL HTTP/1.1 connector. Modify it and use the following configuration:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n<Connector port=\"8443\" \r\n protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\"\r\n connectionTimeout=\"20000\"\r\n redirectPort=\"8443\"\r\n SSLEnabled=\"true\"\r\n scheme=\"https\"\r\n secure=\"true\"\r\n sslProtocol=\"TLS\"\r\n keystoreFile=\"/etc/tomcat8.5/keystore\"\r\n keystorePass=\"changeit\" />\r\n}}}\r\nStep 3: Restart tomcat:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nsudo service tomcat restart\r\n}}}\r\nAt this point, https://[YOUR_IP]:8443/manager/html should also an entry point to Tomcat. Note that it uses the secure kind of http (https) and a different port, which is 8443 by default. Make sure to open the port 8443 on your AWS instance.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Limit a Tomcat application to HTTPS only. Currently, http://YOUR_IP:8080/manager/html entry (which uses HTTP) is still open. In order to disable HTTP and enable HTTPS only, change your !TomcatFormReCaptcha application's web.xml by adding the following code before the \"</web-app>\" tag:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n<security-constraint>\r\n <web-resource-collection>\r\n    <web-resource-name>HTTPSOnly</web-resource-name>\r\n    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\r\n </web-resource-collection>\r\n <user-data-constraint>\r\n    <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>\r\n </user-data-constraint>\r\n</security-constraint>\r\n}}}\r\nThis setting will force all HTTP requests to this application to get redirected to the corresponding HTTPS URL. Reload the application to see if the redirection works for the URL http://YOUR_IP:8080/TomcatFormReCaptcha/. Read this [http://www.itworld.com/article/2769041/development/how-to-configure-tomcat-to-always-require-https.html reference] on more details about how to configure Tomcat to always require HTTPS.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Make necessary changes to your project 2 to use HTTPS always with HTTP disabled.\r\n\r\n[[Span(id=Dashboard)]]\r\n\r\n== Task 4: Implementing a Dashboard using Stored Procedure ==\r\nStep 1: To store information about Fabflix's employees, create a new table called ''' employees''' with the following attributes:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nemail varchar(50) primary key\r\npassword varchar(20) not null\r\nfullname varchar(100)\r\n}}}\r\nStep 2: Insert an employee with **classta@''email.edu''**, **classta**, and **TA CS122B** as its email, password, and full name respectively.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Setup an entry point https://YOUR_IP:8443/fabflix/_dashboard that uses HTTPS. It allows employees to login with a valid email and password to access a dashboard.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Allow a logged-in employee to do the following operations using this dashboard. (You can reuse part of your code in Project 1.)\r\n\r\n * Inserting a new star into the database. If the star has a single name, add it as his last_name and assign an empty string(\"\") to first_name.\r\n * Providing the metadata of the database; in particular, show the name of each table and, for each table, each attribute and its type.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Write a stored procedure called ''add_movie''. Its arguments include all the required fields of the movie, a ''single'' star and a '' single'' genre. (The reason we don't want to pass multiple stars and genres is that the current MySQL implementation doesn't allow stored procedures to take an array argument.) If a record corresponding to the star or genre exists, it is linked to the movie; if not, it is created and then linked to the movie. Insert a movie only if it does not exist. All necessary stars_in_movies and genres_in_movies records are also created. The procedure should output informative status messages to the user as it performs the task. If a movie's record set cannot be correctly made, the procedure needs to output a corresponding message, and no changes to the database are made.\r\n\r\nStep 6: In the dashboard implemented in Step 4, add one more feature that allows an employee to add information related to a movie, including a single star and a single genre. The UI should allow the employee to provide the information, and the backend should call the stored procedure '' add_movie'' created above.\r\n\r\n----\r\n[[Span(id=XMLParsing)]]\r\n\r\n== Task 5: Importing large XML data files into the Fabflix database ==\r\nThe goal of this task is to use a new source of data to increase the content size of the Fabflix movie database.\r\n\r\nYou can find the raw version of this new data source in [attachment:wiki:cs122b-2017-winter-project3:stanford-movies.tar.gz this package]. The main source of these files is [http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/movies/dtd.html here]. Before starting to use these files, it is highly recommended to check the main source and read [http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/movies/doc.html its documentation] to get a better understanding of this dataset.\r\n\r\nParticularly, you are required to parse the files `mains243.xml, actor63.xml `and`casts124.xml` to add new `movies`, `stars`, and `genres` to the Fabflix database (i.e., on top of what you already have in the database). If needed, the `stars_in_movies` and `genres_in_movies` tables should also be updated accordingly. Also, for each XML file in this package, there is a DTD file to be used to understand/validate the structure of that XML file.\r\n\r\nPlease note that in this project it is expected that, if needed, you make reasonable decisions on how to use this new data source. The files are not clean and you may find inconsistencies in them. In such cases, do not be surprised. Make reasonable decisions. Such issues are very common in many real applications. You can use the following high-level description regarding the mapping of the XML tag attributes to the Fabflix database schema that was given in [https://grape.ics.uci.edu/wiki/public/wiki/cs122b-2017-winter-project1 project 1].\r\n\r\nAs shown in Figure 1, the root tag in the file `mains243.xml` is `<movies>`, which consists of several instances of the tag `<directorfilms>`. Each `<directorfilms>` contains the information of a director, along with his/her movies, each movie being an instance of the tag `<film>`. It is clear where to find the values of all the columns of the movies table, except for the `banner_url` and `trailer_url` values that should be left NULL. Furthermore, each <film> has a list of ''assigned categories ''in a `<cats>` tag (i.e., each category as a `<cat>` tag). The value of the `<cat>` tag corresponds to the genre name in the `genres` table of the Fabflix database. If a `<cat>` does not exist in the `genres` table, a new genre must be added, and the `genres_in_movies` table must be updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2017-winter-project3:films_structure.png)]] '''Figure 1.'''\r\n\r\nFor updating the `stars` and `stars_in_movies` tables, you should use the content of the file `casts124.xml`, which is shown in a high-level view in Figure 2.\r\n\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2017-winter-project3:casts_structure.png)]] '''Figure 2.'''\r\n\r\nSimilar to the `<movies>` tag, the content of the `<casts>` tag, which is the root of the file `casts124.xml`, is also grouped by the movie directors. You can find the information on the star-movie connection in the instances of the `<m>` tag. In this tag, the film is identified using the `<f>` tag, which links to the `<fid> `tag of the `<film>` tag in the main file. Tag `<m>` also gives you the `stagename` of the actor of this relation in a tag called `<a>`. The `stagename` helps you connect this `stars_in_movies` record to the right star record. The stars to be added to the `stars` table are parsed out of the file `actors63.xml`. Except for the `photo_url` column of the `stars` table that should be left NULL, it is clear how to use the actors file to populate this table.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many libraries for parsing XML, there are two main approaches towards this problem: (1) SAX: event-based XML parsing and (2) DOM: using a tree-based object model for parsing XML. In SAX, the library '''moves''' through the XML tags and makes calls to ''event-handler functions'' that are implemented by the developer. In DOM, the developer is free to move on ''a tree of objects'' that is made available by the library, each object corresponding to an ''entity'' in the XML tree (e.g., a tag). You are free to choose between either of SAX or DOM approaches to parse the document. For examples, look [http://totheriver.com/learn/xml/code/SAXParserExample.java here for SAX] and [http://totheriver.com/learn/xml/code/DomParserExample.java here for DOM]. You can find [http://totheriver.com/learn/xml/xmltutorial.html#7 here], the instructions and files needed to run these examples.\r\n\r\n=== Requirements: ===\r\n * '''XML parsing''': You should write a Java program to parse the XML files and populate the database.\r\n * '''Performance Tuning''': A naive implementation of your program is expected to be slow. Come up with at least two optimization techniques to reduce the running time of your program. Write an itemized, brief report accessible to describe your optimizations, and the corresponding time reductions.[[BR]]\r\n\r\n=== Remarks: ===\r\n * In case of inconsistencies between the provided data with respect to the relational schema, make sure your program does not crash. The inconsistent data must be reported to the user (print the element name and node value) and your program should resume processing.\r\n * Use NULL for missing values when inserting records into the database.\r\n * For inconsistent values with the schema (like non-integer values for volume or roman numbers), you can treat them as NULL.\r\n * For entries with multiple ISBN/publishers/etc, only use one of them.\r\n * Keep track of duplicate entries like multiple occurrences of an author and insert them only once.\r\n * Make sure the encoding of your parser is ISO-8859-1. You can ignore any special character that cannot be handled with this encoding.\r\n\r\n= Deliverables =\r\nPlease submit all the required files (*.class, *.jar, *.jsp, *.html etc) to run your program as WAR. In addition, include any source files (*.java) under WEB-INF/sources. Read the following [http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.wst.webtools.doc.user%2Ftopics%2Ftwcrewar.html page] to get information about how to create a WAR file.\r\n\r\n * Your submission \"war\" file should be named \"project3_[groupID].war\".\r\n\r\n= Demonstration and Grading Criteria =\r\n'''You are required to demonstrate this project'''. Create a running system from your ZIP file\u00e2\u20ac\u201cquickly.
