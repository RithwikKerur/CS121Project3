It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from wild members of the family. The cat is either a house cat, kept as a pet, or a feral cat, freely ranging and avoiding human contact. A house cat is valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.\n                      How Ernie and Bert Came to Be\n\n     You all know Ernie and Bert- they're those two puppet guys that live in an\napartment on Sesame Street.  You probably also have stayed up late at night\nbreaking into a cold sweat because you couldn't figure out how they were\nrelated.  Most people(besides those k-k00l dooooodz who say \"who cares,they're\npuppets\") say Oh, they are gay lovers.  Well, maybe, but if so, why do they\nplay with toys.  Fine, they are immature gay lovers.  No, because how do they\npay the rent.  They don't work, and don't own a car.  Plus, they sleep in\nseperate beds.  They can't be roommates cuz they are just kids or demented\nadults.  Now that you are thoroughly confused, I will help you sort it out.\n     \n     First of all, Bert is Ernie's father.  That's why they sleep in seperate\nbeds.  If you want, they can be gay and incestuous, but thats up to your sick\nlittle imagination.  Anyway, Bert's wife was red. In case you don't remember\nbert is yellow and ernie is orange.  Red and yellow make orange, hence ernie's\ncolor.\n     \n     Bert worked in a factory for several years before he came to sesame\nstreet(but why did he go to sesame street? - read on!) One day, Bert got just a\nlittle too close to that machine that crushes steel girders into pellets the\nsize of a grain of salt.  His head was smashed, and he was brain damaged.  So\nseverely that he regressed to the intelectual level of a small child-a child\nabout ernie's age.\n     When Bert's wife realized that Bert had become a moron, she divorced him\nand took everything they owned (except that little brat Ernie).  Well, bert's\nlawyer found out and sued the wife for everything she had.  Unfortunately Bert\nand Ernie couldn't live alone so they were put into a community for the\nmentally unwell.  You got it- Sesame Street.  They met Oscar, a wierd hairy man\nobsessed with garbage.  Big Bird, a junkie and hallucinogen user  who always\nthought he was being followed by a brown elephant-like thing called\nSnuffalopagulopaloopulagus.  All the real people on sesame street are\ncounselors for the deranged folks who live there.  Why else would they be so\nbloody nice all the time?  The real people kids are trucked in from nearby\ntowns to act as a positive influence on the patients.\n     Well, thats it.  Years of research went into this, and it actually makes\nsense.     Remember, this is only a theory!!!  It has yet to be proven, but I'd\nlike to see you find a flaw in it.\n________________________________________________________________________________\nHi Dok B0llix, Aldebaran (Don't get bloody face!)\nControl the Wekabeast population-if you know one, kill it now.\nBelieve in the Scary powers of \"BOB\"\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n(C) 1991 by Janitor Brand & The Eleventh Hour\nAll Rights Curiously Examined And Contemplated\n\n  \"Torsion Grip Really Loud\"\n\nCall these fine boards:\n\tThe Janitor's Closet  - (617) 69X-XXXX\n\tThe Works             - (617) 861-8976\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
