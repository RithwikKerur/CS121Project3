You can copy the download URL and use the wget command on AWS to download it.\r\n\r\nThen use wget on your AWS machine to download it:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nwget latest_tomcat_download_url (it should look like this:  http://apache.mirrors.pair.com/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.30/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.30.tar.gz\r\n}}}\r\nAfter you download the tar.gz, decompress it to a desired destination (for example, I use /home/ubuntu/tomcat)\r\n\r\n{{{\r\nmkdir /home/ubuntu/tomcat\r\n}}}\r\n{{{\r\ntar xvf apache-tomcat-8.5.29.tar.gz -C /home/ubuntu/tomcat/ --strip-components=1\r\n}}}\r\nNow go to\u00a0/home/ubuntu/tomcat/, and use ls, you show see the following contents:\r\n\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-install-tomcat-on-aws:tomcat-dir.jpeg)]]\r\n\r\n== Configure Tomcat Memory ==\r\nBy default, the maximum heap available for Tomcat may not be enough for large projects. Thus, we need to change the memory configuration by the following steps.\r\n\r\nGo to\u00a0/home/ubuntu/tomcat/bin/, and create a text file name setenv.sh, which contains the following lines:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nenv JAVA_OPTS=\"-Xmx512m -Xms128m\"\r\n}}}\r\nXmx means the maximum heap memory available for Tomcat, and Xms means the initial memory available after each garbage collection. You may vary them based on your machine capacity.\r\n\r\n== Change Access Setting of host-manager and manager ==\r\nhost-manager and manager are two useful default applications provided by Tomcat to manage the Tomcat server. However, by default they can be accessed by only the machine hosting tomcat, i.e., localhost.\r\n\r\nTo change this, you need to change /'''home/ubuntu/tomcat/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml''' and '''/home/ubuntu/tomcat/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml''' by deleting the following lines:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n<Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve\"\u00a0\r\n\r\n      allow=\"127\\.\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1\" />\r\n}}}\r\n== Create a Tomcat User ==\r\nNow, create a tomcat user so that you can manage the tomcat server remotely.\r\n\r\nEdit /home/ubuntu/tomcat/conf/tomcat-users.xml, and add the following line:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n<user username=\"tomcat\" password=\"123456\" roles=\"manager-gui,admin-gui\"/>\r\n}}}\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-install-tomcat-on-aws:tomcat-users.jpeg)]]\r\n\r\nBy doing so, you've created a user named \"tomcat\", and its password is \"123456\". You've also granted two roles \"manager-gui\" and \"admin-gui\" to it.\r\n\r\n== Start Tomcat ==\r\nNow you are ready to start tomcat by executing the following command:\r\n\r\n{{{\r\n/home/ubuntu/tomcat/bin/startup.sh\r\n}}}\r\nIf you see this, then it means your tomcat has started properly.\r\n\r\n== Open port for AWS ==\r\nIf you do the above steps on your local machine, then you should be able to access\u00a0http://localhost:8080\u00a0from your browser to access tomcat.\r\n\r\nHowever, on AWS, the port 8080 is not opened to public by default. Thus, you need to open it as follows.\r\n\r\nGo to your AWS console, and click the item under \"'''Security Groups'''\" for your instance.\r\n\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-install-tomcat-on-aws:security_group.jpeg)]]\r\n\r\nClick \"Edit\" to add more inbound rules:\r\n\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-install-tomcat-on-aws:add-rule.jpeg)]]\r\n\r\n== Access Tomcat ==\r\nNow you should be able to access your tomcat server using\u00a0http://public_ip:8080, and you should be able to see the following page:\r\n\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-install-tomcat-on-aws:tomcat.jpeg)]]\r\n\r\nIf you want to access manager or host-manager, just click the button on the right, and type the username/password you've set in the tomcat-users.xml file.\r\n\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-install-tomcat-on-aws:manager-pwd.jpeg)]]\r\n\r\n[[Image(wiki:cs122b-2019-winter-project1-install-tomcat-on-aws:manager.jpeg)]]\r\n\r\n>", "encoding": "utf-8"}
