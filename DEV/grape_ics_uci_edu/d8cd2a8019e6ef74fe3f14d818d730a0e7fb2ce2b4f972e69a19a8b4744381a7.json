Details of how to turn in a given assignment will be included in each assignment's handout. The 40% of your grade attributed to homework will be based on your ''top 7 out of 8'' homework scores. (You can spend the 8th one however you like, but if you decide to skip an assignment, do keep in mind that the material will still be on the exams and that the homework is intended to be a useful study/practice tool for those -- you will still be responsible for mastering <ins>all</ins> \"skipped\" material.) There will also be short weekly quizzes in the discussion sections to give you further practice with the course material; those will count very little towards your final grade (they will contribute 3%), and they're just there for your benefit (to give you another chance to check your understanding of things and see what questions you might want to ask the TA).</span></td>\n                      </tr>\n            </tbody><tbody class=\"unmod\">\n                  <tr>\n                          <th>100</th><th>90</th><td class=\"l\"><span></span></td>\n                  </tr><tr>\n                          <th>101</th><th>91</th><td class=\"l\"><span>=== Grade Change Policy ===</span></td>\n                  </tr>\n            </tbody>\n              <tbody class=\"skipped\">\n                <tr>\n                  <th><a href=\"/wiki/asterix/wiki/cs122a-2019-spring?version=4#L106\">\u2026</a></th>\n                  <th><a href=\"/wiki/asterix/wiki/cs122a-2019-spring?version=5#L96\">\u2026</a></th>\n                  <td>\u00a0</td>\n                </tr>\n              </tbody>\n            <tbody class=\"unmod\">\n                  <tr>\n                          <th>106</th><th>96</th><td class=\"l\"><span></span></td>\n                  </tr><tr>\n                          <th>107</th><th>97</th><td class=\"l\"><span>=== Late Policy ===</span></td>\n                  </tr>\n            </tbody><tbody class=\"mod\">\n                      <tr class=\"first\">\n                        <th>108</th><th>\u00a0</th><td class=\"l\"><span>Due dates will be clearly indicated on all HW assignments.
