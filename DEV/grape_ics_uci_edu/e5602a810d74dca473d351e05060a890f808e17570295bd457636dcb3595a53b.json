Any student found to somehow be involved in cheating or aiding others in doing so will be academically prosecuted to the maximum extent possible: that means that you could fail this course in its entirety. (Ask around - it's happened.)  Just say ''no'' to cheating!\r\n\r\n----\r\n== Software Platform(s) ==\r\nThis class will make use of the Python ecosystem, including the Python language, various Python packages/tools for data analysis and machine learning, Jupyter notebooks, and open source databases (PostgreSQL).  For convenience and package completeness, students are advised to download the most recent Anaconda distribution of Python and friends (https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the most recent EDB distribution of PostgreSQL (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).\r\n\r\n----\r\n== HW Due Dates & Links ==\r\n=== Homework Assignments ===\r\n|| '''Due Date''' || '''Topic''' || '''Assignment''' ||\r\n|| Fri, Jan (6 PM) || Database Cobweb Removal  || [https://docs.google.com/document/d/todo] ||\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
