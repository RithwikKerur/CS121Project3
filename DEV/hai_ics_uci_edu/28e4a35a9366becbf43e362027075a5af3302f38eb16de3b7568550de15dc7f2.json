I first gather user requirements using qualitative methods, and then implement system interfaces and functions with standard design and development tools. I evaluate the systems by conducting longitudinal studies using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. I received my Ph.D. in Computer and Communication Sciences from the Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland in 2015. My supervisor was Dr. Pearl Pu, the director of Human Computer Interaction Group. Before that, I received my Master's degrees in Security and Mobile Computing from both Aalto University in Finland and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Norway in 2010 and Bachelor's degree in Information Security from Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China in 2008. I was a research intern in the headquarter of Nokia Research Center in Helsinki in 2009 and 2010. </p>\n        \n        <p>\n        <img class=\"icon\" alt=\"email icon\" src=\"img/social/email.png\"/>\n        ychen25@uci.edu\n        </p>\n\n\t\t\n        <div class=\"leading\"></div>\n        <a name=\"other\"></a>\n        <h2>Other Members</h2>\n\t\t  <div class=\"subtle\">Past and Present</div>\n        \n        <div class=\"leading\"></div>\n\t\t  <table>\n\t\t    <tr>\n\t\t      <th>Name</th>\n\t\t      <th>Role</th>\n\t\t      <th>When</th>\n\t\t    </tr>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t    <tr>\n\t\t      <td>Dr. Xiaoyong Liu</td>\n\t\t      <td>Visited from Guangdong Polytechnic Normal University</td>\n\t\t      <td>Summer 2016-2017</td>\n\t\t    </tr>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t    <tr>\n\t\t      <td>Lauren Sukumar</td>\n\t\t      <td>Undergraduate</td>\n\t\t      <td>Spring 2017-Present</td>\n\t\t    </tr>\n\t\t    <tr>\n\t\t      <td>Fatemeh Mousavi</td>\n\t\t      <td>Research volunteer</td>\n\t\t      <td>Fall 2016-Present</td>\n\t\t    </tr>\n\t\t    <tr>\n\t\t      <td>Diane Monchusap</td>\n\t\t      <td>Undergraduate</td>\n\t\t      <td>Spring 2017</td>\n\t\t    </tr>\n\t\t    <tr>\n\t\t      <td>Justin Park</td>\n\t\t      <td>Interned as junior undergraduate from Cornell University</td>\n\t\t      <td>Summer 2016</td>\n\t\t    </tr>\n\t\t    <tr>\n\t\t      <td>Tiancheng Lin</td>\n\t\t      <td>Junior undergraduate from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</td>\n\t\t      <td>Summer 2016</td>\n\t\t    </tr>\n\t\t    <tr>\n\t\t      <td><a href=\"https://uclic.ucl.ac.uk/people/amid-ayobi\">Amid Ayobi, MS</a></td>\n\t\t      <td>Visited from University College London</td>\n\t\t      <td>Summer 2016</td>\n\t\t    </tr>\n\t\t  </table>\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        <!--div class=\"leading\"></div>\n        <a name=\"collaborators\"></a>\n        <h2>Collaborators</h2>\n        \n        <p>\n        <em>Coming soon!</em>\n        </p-->\n        \n      </div>\n      \n      \n      <div id=\"footer\">\n        <p>Website Copyright &copy; HAI Lab</a> 2016.</p>\n      </div>\n      <p class=\"text-right\">&nbsp;</p>\n      \n      \n    </div>\n    \n    \n    \n    <script>\n      \n      \n      $( \"#navbar\" ).menu({\n                          position: { my: \"left top\", at: \"left-0 top+34\" }\n                          });\n                          \n                          \n      </script>\n    \n    \n    \n    \n  </body>\n  \n</html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
