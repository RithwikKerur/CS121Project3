One subject is about the environment. Notice the slingshot on the boy's pocket? \nHe decided not to hurt or kill any of the birds.\nAlso, if you can feel the way I feel about the painting, don't you get the impression that they are rejoicing? \nThe two kid's raised arms are in celebration of a forthcoming bountiful rice harvest. The fields are heavily filled with golden rice.\n</font>\n</p>\n<BR clear=ALL />\n\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<p>\n<img src=\"Salat_Nguni't_Sapat.jpg\" height=\"375\" width=\"600\" align=\"left\" hspace=50>\n<font face=\"tahoma\" color =\"maroon\" size=\"3\">\nSalat Nguni't Sapat (Not Enough but Enough)\n</font>\n<br/>\n<font face=\"tahoma\" color=\"navy\" size=\"3\">\nMany children in rural areas in the Philippines walk miles just to get to school. <br/>\nThey wear ragged clothes, worn out and broken footwear and have barely enough money for food and school supplies. \nSome classes have more than 40 students so everybody has to share tables and chairs and the room is cramped. \nBut surprisingly so they feel happy that they have the opportunity to go to school while many don't have that chance at all. \nThis is an example of a trait of Filipinos - to always look at the brighter side of things no matter how trying times can be.\n</font>\n</p>\n<BR clear=ALL />\n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<font face=\"tahoma\" color =\"maroon\" size=\"4\">\nAbout Paul \n</font>\n<br/>\n<font face=\"tahoma\" color =\"navy\" size=\"3\">\nPaul is an up-and-coming artist in the Philippines.\nHe has been making art as young as 4 years old and at that early age he knew that he wanted to be an artist. \nIt is only recently, however, that he decided \nto give art a serious professional chance as a career. He creates art from 3:00 am to 6:30 am and transforms into a museum curator from 8 am to 5 pm weekdays. \nPaul has developed his own signature style of art, and relishes in creating not just for the viewer's eyes but to also stimulate other senses and emotions as well. \nHis subjects can be drawn from anything around  him but most of his works are taken from cultural and environmental themes, with both sometimes curiously intersecting in one canvas. \nHe subtlety includes  hidden messages, stories, and lessons in the paintings.  Paul prefers to use a lot of bright colours and high contrast. \nHis style is eclectic. He mix and matches impressionism  with pop, low brow, cubism and fauvism. His work is generally identified between impressionism, pop and naif art. \nHe considers Vincent Van Gogh and Filipino painter Marcel Antonio as his art influences. \n</font>\n\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
