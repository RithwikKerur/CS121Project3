For efficient and fast computation servers store this data in memory. Further\\, the database is changing continuously and we need to update the in-memory view of these large number of servers in real-time. For example\\, in Google Search Ads application we have Advertisers configuration stored in a database and this data is loaded in the memory of various servers to compute Ads in a scalable and fast way. In this talk\\, we describe our solution to this data distribution problem and the challenges that we encountered in providing a highly reliable and low latency service. \\n\u00a0 \\nSpeaker Bio:\u00a0 \\nSushant Jain is a member of the Ads Quality Infrastructure group at Google Inc. His research interests include distributed systems and network routing. He is currently an engineering director and a lead engineer for multiple products in Ads Quality Infrastructure with a focus on data management and distribution. Many of the systems developed as part of his work at Google (such as WhyHigh\\, Bandwidth Enforcer\\, B4 Network) are actively deployed at Google and have had significant research impact as well. He is a recipient of the Best Paper Award at ACM SIGCOMM IMC 2011. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 2005 and a B.Tech. from IIT Delhi in 1999. \\n\r\nURL:https://isg.ics.uci.edu/event/large-scale-and-low-latency-data-distribution-from-database-to-servers/\r\nLOCATION:DBH 6011\r\nATTACH;FMTTYPE=image/jpeg:https://isg.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/isg/uploads/2018/10/google-datacenter-tech-13.jpg\r\nEND:VEVENT\r\nEND:VCALENDAR", "encoding": "utf-8"}
