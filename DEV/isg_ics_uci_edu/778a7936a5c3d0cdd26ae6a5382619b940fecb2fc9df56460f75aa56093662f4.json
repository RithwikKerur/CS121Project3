His research focus is on computer architecture and system design for lowering the cost of handling large amounts of data. Before joining UCI\\, Sang-Woo did his Ph.D with Professor Arvind at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\, and his B.S. at Seoul National University in Korea. His industry experience includes intern at the Big Data Discovery team at Oracle\\, and Server/Client developer at Nexon inc.\\n\\n\r\nURL:https://isg.ics.uci.edu/event/prof-sang-woo-jun-lowering-the-cost-of-large-scale-data-analytics-via-efficient-use-of-flash-storage/\r\nLOCATION:DBH 3011\r\nEND:VEVENT\r\nEND:VCALENDAR", "encoding": "ascii"}
