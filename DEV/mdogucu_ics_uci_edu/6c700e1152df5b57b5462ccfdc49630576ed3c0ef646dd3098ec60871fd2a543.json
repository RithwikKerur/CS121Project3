I would recommend you to first focus on your learning, then grades will follow.\r\n            I really hope you can focus on your own learning. It is my intent to design assessments that are source of intellectual curiosity, joy, and learning rather than a source of stress.\r\n            <br> <br>\r\n            <h2>Attendance</h2>\r\n            You will not be graded solely on attendance.\r\n            Research suggests that attendance is a better predictor of grades than many other measures such\r\n            as SAT scores, study habits, and study skills\r\n            (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0034654310362998\">Cred\u00e9, Roch & Kieszczynka, 2010</a>).\r\n            Even though that is not a causal claim (we will learn more on this), If you would like to be successful\r\n            in this class, you should attend ALL lectures\r\n            and discussion sessions. Most of what we do in person will be hands on and you will need to submit\r\n            some of the work you complete in lectures and in discussion.\r\n            An important portion of your grade will based on these\r\n            assignments. You will basically receive points for coming to class and completing group\r\n            work. In addition, I expect you to come to class on time. The class material builds on in\r\n            a linear fashion as the class progresses so if you come in late, you may miss crucial material.\r\n            <br> <br>\r\n            <h2>Reading Questions </h2>\r\n\r\n            Whenever there is an assigned reading, you should read before coming to class. Before class, you  will have\r\n            to respond to questions online related to the reading. These questions will be on Canvas in multiple choice format.\r\n            The main purpose of this assessment is to get you ready for hands on activities in class. For a given set of reading\r\n            questions, if you score 50% or higher you will receive full credit. At the end of the quarter, your lowest\r\n            reading question grade will be dropped but this rule only applies if you have completed all the reading questions\r\n            throughout the quarter. Reading questions have to be completed individually. You may not seek help\r\n            from others. Reading questions cannot be submitted late.\r\n            <br> <br>\r\n            <h2>In Class Activities </h2>\r\n\r\n            We will be engaged in solving problems in class. You will work in groups to answer\r\n            questions, discuss, and express your opinion. From time to time in class activities\r\n            will be graded for completion.\r\n            <br> <br>\r\n            <h2>Homework Assignments</h2>\r\n\r\n            Homework assignments are usually assigned on a weekly basis and they are usually due Fridays at 5:00 pm.\r\n            The format of the homework and how to submit (electronically or on paper) will be detailed in the\r\n            homework instructions. Homework assignemtnts have to be completed individually. You may not seek help\r\n            from anyone except me or TAs. For each hour, homework assignments are submitted late,\r\n            you will lose 10% of your grade. Thus if you submit your homework 10 hours later than it is due,\r\n            you will not receive any points, however, you will still receive feedback.\r\n            <br> <br>\r\n\r\n            <h2>Labs</h2>\r\n            You will be working on lab assignments during discussion sessions in groups.\r\n            You will complete most lab assignments on RStudio Cloud. Labs are due to the end of discussion time.\r\n            Further instructions on how to submit will be shared by your TAs during each discussion.\r\n            If you are behind in the lab, seek help. If you are ahead provide help.\r\n            <br><br>\r\n\r\n            <h2>Midterm</h2>\r\n            There will be one midterm exam and it is scheduled for Nov 4. The midterm will have both an in class\r\n            and take-home part. For the take-home part you will have a week to complete. The in class part will be closed book but you will be given equations in the exam.\r\n            You will need a scientific calculator. You will not be allowed to use a graphing calculator.\r\n            <br><br>\r\n            <h2>Final Exam</h2>\r\n            Final exams are scheduled for Wed, Dec 11 (Section C) 08:00 -10:00 am and Fri, Dec 13 (Section D) 08:00 -10:00 am\r\n            The final will have both an in class  and take-home part. For the take-home part you will have a week to complete.\r\n            The in class part will be closed book but you will be given equations in the exam. The final will be cumulative.\r\n            You will need a scientific calculator. You will not be allowed to use a graphing calculator.\r\n            <br> <br>\r\n            <h2>Extra credit</h2>\r\n\r\n            There are certain circumstances that you will be granted extra credit:\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Participation in Statistics and Data Science Related Competitions\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>National Competitions</li>\r\n              <li>Statewide Competitions</li>\r\n              <li>Campus Competitions</li>\r\n            </ul> </li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n\r\n            The number of points awarded based on competitions will be at the\r\n            discretion of the instructor based on the alignment of course goals and  the goals\r\n            of the competition, your ranking in the competition, and the amount of time put\r\n            into competition.\r\n\r\n            There are certain circumstances that may be granted extra credit at the discretion\r\n            of the instructor:\r\n\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Asking \"good\" questions on Piazza: instructors, TAs, and graders can mark\r\n              your question as good. Note that extra credit is only possible for multiple\r\n            good question status. You should not try to achieve this status. Your focus should\r\n          be using Piazza effectively then extra points may follow. </li>\r\n\r\n          <li>Posting \"good\" answers on Piazza: instructors, TAs, and graders can mark\r\n          your answers as good.

Below I try to lighten the general\r\n            information with a side note that each academic has their own preference.\r\n\r\n            <br> <br>\r\n\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>If a person already informs you about how you should call them please respect that.</li>\r\n              <li>Undergraduate degrees may be followed up by master's and doctoral degrees. If a person has a doctoral degree than they can be\r\n                referred as <i>Dr.</i> folowed by their last name. Yes, just like medical doctors! It may be hard to guess whether someone has a doctoral degree. If you are, for instance, emailing\r\n              someone for an opportunity, make sure to check their website before emailing them. They may list their degrees. The most common doctoral degree\r\n            is abbreviated as <i>Ph.D.</i> but there are other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_doctoral_degrees_in_the_US\">doctoral degrees</a>.\r\n          Since the title <i>Dr.</i> is based on a degree, you can also use this title with anyone outside of academia if they have a doctoral degree.</li>\r\n            <li>Even though many college professors have doctoral degrees, not all do. For instance, in the field of fine arts, master's degrees serve as the terminal degree.\r\n            In other words, a fine arts professor may not have a doctorate but they have completed all the degree requirements to become a professor. For such academics\r\n          who do not have a doctorate degree, you can refer to them as <i>Prof.</i> followed by their last name. You can also use the <i>Prof.</i> title with academics who\r\n        have doctoral degrees. In short, the title Prof. comes with the job. </li>\r\n        <li>The titles <i>Miss</i> and <i>Mrs.</i> are used for unmarried and married women respectively. In formal settings, since you are not aware of marital status\r\n        of the woman you are referring to you can use <i>Ms.</i>. Use this title only with women who are not <i>Dr.</i> or  <i>Prof.</i>. The male title <i>Mr.</i>\r\n      does not indicate marital status and can be used for men who are not <i>Dr.</i> or <i>Prof.</i>.

In a recent <a href=\"https://www.aacu.org/leap/public-opinion-research/2015-survey-falling-short\">survey</a> conducted by Association of\r\n            American and Colleges and Universities (AACU) found that employers ranked teamwork skills as one of\r\n            the most valued skills and even more so than\r\n            undergraduate major when hiring recent graduate skills.\r\n\r\n            Understandably, team work comes with its challenges given your busy schedules and different interests. However,\r\n            remember that work place teamwork will not be much different than your current teamwork experiences. Struggles\r\n            may always rise but here are few ways to avoid them. When working in a group:\r\n            <ul>\r\n              <li>Communicate your schedule to other members clearly early on.</li>\r\n              <li>Listen to your team members with an open mindset.</li>\r\n              <li>Share your resources with your team members.</li>\r\n              <li>Communicate frequently.</li>\r\n              <li>Remember that the goal is to learn so help each other learn rather than just to get the work done.</li>\r\n\r\n            </ul>\r\n\r\n            <h2 id =\"online\">Online communication </h2>\r\n            Most of our online comminication will take place on Piazza.
