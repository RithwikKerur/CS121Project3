early formative years.  I am in Nagpur \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I spent most of my first 21 years of life in this area.  Combined that with the fact that my mother and sisters still lives here and Sudha\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s family lives here, Nagpur is my home town and a special place for me.  Visiting here is always emotional and nostalgic \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even though I come here about twice a year.</p>\n<p>Nagpur has become one of the cleanest and best organized cities.  Good roads, nice gardens, very little encroachment on roads by local merchants, good signs, and usually smoothly flowing traffic is very impressive.  This is a big change from my days.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, in terms of rapid growth, like the one that made Bangalore what it is, this is still a sleepy little town.  Very little IT and any other industrial growth has taken place here.  One sees good signs of progress in terms of construction and some shopping centers but the real advances in terms of making it a modern place are not keeping up with some of the other cities in India.  For example, there is still not Internet connectivity in some of the best hotels here \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and Wi Fi is not indicated at most of the places on my lap top,  During my travels, possibly Nagpur is the worst place in terms of Internet connectivity.  I have to go either to a cybercaf\u00c3\u00a9 or to Lambent\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s office.  Last time, on Monday July 10th, I had to go to the fourth Internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 because the first 3 were still closed at 10:30 AM.</p>\n<p>Lambent is possibly the biggest IT business here that was built under the leadership of Shashi Chaudhary and I am proud to have been associated with it.  Incidentally, Lambent is now acquired by Indus Logic. It is likely to grow under that umbrella.  A spin-off from Lambent is mBlazon for developing mobile games related products.  That company already has some products and will be lead by Shaheer Ahmad, who was with Lambent from its beginning.  Shashi and I are on the board to help Shaheer in this new venture.</p>\n<p>Rumors are that Nagpur is going to become an international airport and a cargo hub.  Also that some IT companies \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Satyam is the name I hear \u00e2\u20ac\u201c have bought lots of land here to build a big campus for their activities.  Obviously, I remain very interested in seeing things happen in Nagpur.</p>\n  \t\t\t</div>\n  \t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta-bar clearfix\">\t        \t\t\t\n    \t\t\t<div class=\"entry-meta\">\n    \t\t\t\t<span class=\"by-author\">By <a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/author/ramesh/\">Ramesh</a></span> |\n    \t\t\t\t<span class=\"date\"><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/\" title=\"7:15 pm\">July 11, 2006</a></span> |\n    \t\t\t\t             \t\t<span class=\"category\"><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/category/general-updates/\" rel=\"category tag\">General Updates</a></span> |\n             \t \n    \t\t\t\t             \t\t<span class=\"comments\"><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comments\">32 Comments</a></span> |\n             \t \t\t          \t\t\t\t\n    \t\t\t</div><!-- .entry-meta -->\n    \t\t</div>\n\n  \t\t\t\t\t\t<ul class=\"default-wp-page clearfix\">\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"previous\"><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/words-space-and-time/\" rel=\"prev\"><span class=\"meta-nav\">&larr;</span> Words: Space and Time</a></li>\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"next\"><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/travel-experiences/\" rel=\"next\">Travel Experiences <span class=\"meta-nav\">&rarr;</span></a></li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\n<div id=\"comments\" class=\"comments-area\">\n\n\t\n\t\t\t<h3 class=\"comments-title\">\n\t\t\t32 thoughts on &ldquo;<span>Visiting Nagpur</span>&rdquo;\t\t</h3>\n\n\t\t<ol class=\"commentlist\">\n\t\t\t\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-495\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-495\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9bbe0fe9db136f25ef5d36bbd591aedc?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/9bbe0fe9db136f25ef5d36bbd591aedc?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Amit Mohod </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-495\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2006-07-24T22:32:08-07:00\">July 24, 2006 at 10:32 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Hi,<br />\nA very nice post. I am from nagpur and now at mumbai as S/W engg. It feels good to read about your own city. The changes in nagpur is really amazing. The person who last visited there say before 4-5 years even will not recognise the places and roads now.<br />\nAlso as said by ramesh the ppl of nagpur really have a good traffic sence.<br />\nAlso its true that Nagpur is too far from industrial growth. also in IT sector. The main reason behind it, what I think is the dirty politics and the politicians with no concern about developing the vidarbha region. Thr are many well known politics in Power, in state and in Central too&#8230;.<br />\nBut none of them is even trying to lift the city in this aspect. Central Aviation ministor Mr. Prafull Patel is one of them.<br />\nIt is rediculus that a man from Nagpur region is Aviation ministor and he is not doing much for forth coming Cargo Hub. This Hub can attract many industries in the city and can generate vast employment.<br />\nThe citizons like me feel stuck on such issue as we cant do any thing.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-498\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-498\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/953e89662307e267e32b4bb3d0377ce7?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/953e89662307e267e32b4bb3d0377ce7?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Rahul Bhanot </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-498\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2006-07-26T00:01:09-07:00\">July 26, 2006 at 12:01 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>First good wishes for this blog, Mr Ramesh. Well I am from a place which is close to Nagpur, Jabalpur. But my grand father came here just after the partition and settled here before moving to Jabalpur. So why I am interested in writting in this place? Nagpur has been core of my family business for about 25 years now and we are expanding.  I cannot agree more with the posting of Mr Amit, dont see any reason why a city with all the infrastructure and educated mass be denied progress. But I am pretty optomist about this city &#8211; it is the FUTURE CITY. The only thing it is waiting is one spark of developement process, I am sure it has the potential to become one of the more known cities of India. I hope and pray for its well being, also promise to do whatever in my capacity to make what ever little I can do for this beautiful city.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-499\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-499\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/befc0406feac2a3f60272c0c6b304562?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/befc0406feac2a3f60272c0c6b304562?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Jateen </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-499\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2006-07-26T23:37:57-07:00\">July 26, 2006 at 11:37 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>I just heard news that Microsoft is goign to invest 700 cr. in Pune.So where Nagpur stands now?

Did play Cricket at National level for Vidharbha.<br />\nUsed to stay at VCA ground at Civil Lines. Now from last 10 years, I am in US. Nagpur always used to fascinate me. It was/still is so Green and peaceful. Wide roads and cosmopolitan culture. Last year I went and visited Bombay and Delhi for some business opportunity. Then came back to Nagpur and concluded that Nagpur is The place to do business. The infrastructure is already there. Road/Energy/Connectivity and Location.</p>\n<p>Only thing it lacks is voice at National level. I guess once you have some private participation then you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need Govt. </p>\n<p>Of-course energy resources are diverted from Nagpur to Western Maharastra. </p>\n<p>Nagpur is reach in energy. So many power plants. Central location. I used to always think why Nagpur is so behind as compare to rest of the cities? Besides from ignorant politicians. Now finally corporate India has woken up and realized that what Nagpur has to offer. It is just the beginning. I firmly believe that Nagpur will be best location to do business in next 5 years, even without Govt. help. Once capitalism kicks in then there no looking back. That is what exactly happening with Nagpur. I am glad/sad.<br />\nNagpur will loose it charm of  little laid back city. Life will be fast. But, I guess that is all part and parcel of growth. </p>\n<p>I can keep on going .. </p>\n<p>Thanks,<br />\nNiranjan</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment byuser comment-author-ramesh bypostauthor even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-922\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-922\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c7e700ac9901c23d82d2720e3664dbd?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4c7e700ac9901c23d82d2720e3664dbd?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Ramesh <span> Post author</span></cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-922\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-03-10T09:42:24-07:00\">March 10, 2007 at 9:42 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Thanks, Niranjan.

But that should take atleast 1 more year. Already INOX opened in Nagpur , CINEMAX will open soon. and 4 more multiplexes have been constructed.The rate of growth depends on these infrastructure things and with more private companies already announced their plans for Nagpur we could see some more investment to land in Nagpur in next 1-2 years.<br />\n                                                                                                   But i think Amravati should also be developed along with Nagpur. Do&#8217;nt want Nagpur to get crowded just like Pune further it will help in spreadign the development throughout Vidarbha region which is vert very essential&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-960\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-960\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1026ac320ab009e50e555c9435036c2?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d1026ac320ab009e50e555c9435036c2?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">sandeep </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-960\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-04-05T06:12:26-07:00\">April 5, 2007 at 6:12 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Interestng blog, Thanks to Mr. Ramesh Jain. am a nagpurian and played tennis for the univ.

My reaction to what is happening there 2 1/2 years was shock=you have to be mad to buy real estate and why would you touch anything that is too good to be true. so a year and half ago i dipped my toes by buying 2 small properties that too with some big daddy partners ( so i could recover some at least) which by the way have tripled= amazing. this town is going nuts near the airport and am now convinced that the likes of Satyam, HCL tech, Shapoorji Pallonji who have invested have brought on critical mass in that area for it to continue, perhaps not at the same pace, so wake up and smell the coffee, but do it in the orange city<br />\nand btw for all you cricketeers the Manohars are as active as ever with Shashank VP of BCCI and he has raised a huge chunk for the new stadium and amazingly already 1/3rd of it is built by guess who Shapoorji Pallonji and SP has also bought a 100 acres in the SEZ area along with likes of the other IT chaps. all u VRCEans probably know who got Boeing at 163 mm into ngp.<br />\nSo wake up and have some OJ, it may boost your risk appetite&#8230;&#8230;.cheers</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-1032\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-1032\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dc74cc68fd1e8c56d52db2e9d8bbbb7f?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dc74cc68fd1e8c56d52db2e9d8bbbb7f?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Kapil Taran </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-1032\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-06-05T15:00:49-07:00\">June 5, 2007 at 3:00 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Hi, Great to read articles from Nagpur. I am a Nagpurian. And would like to contribute max for Nagpur. But curretly  I am in UK and would soon be returning to Nagpur for good. I am in favour of devlopement but also worried about environment. Devlopement around Wardha Road/MIHAN will definitely increase pollution level and affect the temperature in this already HOT city (in summer)..<br />\nI have already started growing Trees specially Neem around my house with the help of my friend who is interested in this. I would like you guys to contribute for this great City&#8230; growing trees is one step towards this.. I would like information on Solar power for homes if anyone has&#8230; I would like to install the same in my house..</p>\n<p>Also the civic sense should increase. NMC should come up with mass transport system. I know Star bus is started but how many of middle class and higher middle class uses bus in Nagpur. One strange thing in Nagpur.. none of the buses have number &#8230; I mean the route numbers. This is quite surprising..how do you expect to identify the route by just reading something in Marathi.. I mean it should have proper numbering scheme.. standardisation is must&#8230;NMC should look into this..</p>\n<p>Lot has been written about Nagpur in different news papers across the world that Nagpur is the first Indian city to be developed for infrastructurre before the arrival of actual growth same as Chinese line of developement.  Hope this is true and Nagpur emerges the best city to live not like Pune, Bangalore and other so called &#8220;HiTech&#8221; cities but no infrastructure to sustain the growth.<br />\nEnough of my thougths&#8230;. thanks for reading..<br />\nCheers,<br />\nKapil</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-1080\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-1080\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6349c6fd6b54cd5826bda24831733146?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6349c6fd6b54cd5826bda24831733146?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://none' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Pankaj</a> </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-1080\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-07-09T03:50:19-07:00\">July 9, 2007 at 3:50 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Its Good to read about Nagpur and so many message that are posted here&#8230;..I am from Akola but have stayed in Nagpur too and therefore would like to see Vidharbha growing, as the trcikle down effect someday may happen to other cities as well.</p>\n<p>I am looking after investments in real estate (for a company) and Nagpur is also one of our focus cities.

I am basically from Nagpur, now currently staying in Bangalore working in the Medical Transcription industry.<br />\nFirst of thanks to  Mr. Ramesh Jain, who started this blog.<br />\nI have gone through all of ur comments and i m very glad to know that all of you are keeping yourrselves updated about the happennings of this city and its surroundings&#8230;but have any one of you thought why we are only ones in maharashtra who are getting ill-treated by any Govt. that comes in state&#8230;and there is something else that i would like to bring light on:<br />\n1. Vidharbha region has not one, not two, but three power plants viz. Koradi, Khaparkheda, and Chandrapur; but we are the only ones among the bigger cities in maharashtra to have major power cuts almost every day!<br />\n2. The much awaited MIHAN and the prestigious GAJRAJ projects were planned for the city way back in the early 90;s by the central government, but nothing is being done for the early implementation of these projects; leave alone implementation a day will come that these projects will either be grabbed by Hyderabad or Bangalore(remember both cities are having their new airports ready by next year). Even the IAF had stated to shift their GAJRAJ project to some other city if land acquisition with other amenties was not made in time.<br />\n3. Remember some years ago there was a huge demand for separate state of VIDARBHA? Why cant this be one of the the reason for the ill-treatment meted to by state govt? Probably that&#8217;s why they are diverting all other industrial projects away from vidarbha.<br />\n4. The debt-ridden farmers of Vidarbha are commiting suicides almost every day. Our hon&#8217;ble CM has announced a special package for these farmers&#8230;just think cooly&#8230; if this would have implemented on a war-footing basis, a lot lives could have been saved.<br />\n5. Ummm&#8230;and now last but not the least&#8230;We Nagpurians are having a very bad habit of blaming others not something not done, and we lack unity among ourselves when it comes to improving infrastructure, employment and other basic amenties. i don&#8217;t want to communalise this point by adding anything further&#8230;hope u are getting my point. i feel it&#8217;s high time that we shed this bad habit of ours and do something&#8230;at least i have started doing something&#8230;by bringing my couple of childhood friends ( both are civil engineers) to bangalore and getting them a job in a company which is from Pune!!! ( remember there is an equal unity among maharashtrians in Karnataka or any other state u name!!)  Now both of my friends are planning to take their transfers back to Nagpur and work on their own..<br />\nIf i have done any mistakes ( or blunders) please feel free to reply me..<br />\nThanks for reading &#8230;<br />\nregards</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-1099\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-1099\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fcb17bd0dcc05ec4c6b808c9f7d8939?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1fcb17bd0dcc05ec4c6b808c9f7d8939?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Sunil Mane </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-1099\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2007-07-31T05:29:15-07:00\">July 31, 2007 at 5:29 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Hi,<br />\nThis is very nice blog to discuss abt Vidharbha.

The MIHAN project will be established on 10,000 acres on the outskirts of Nagpur. The zero mile city or geographic centre of the country will include a captive power plant and special economic zones in about 3,500 acres. IT parks are to be established by DLF, Satyam, Wipro, and Dell.</p>\n<p>The American computer manufacturer will have one of its units here besides that of the Boeing. Nagpur was found to have enormous scope for growth because of vast extent of open land available near the city. More attractive is the cheaper price of land.</p>\n<p>\u00e2\u20ac\u0153About two years back, the open market price of land near the MIHAN site was just Rs. 10 lakh per acre. It increased to Rs. 30 lakh per acre in one year. Since big investors from Andhra Pradesh entered the market, the prices have shot up to Rs. 1 crore per acre,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d said an architect from Nagpur.

Feel so homely hearing so many folks from Nagpur. Thanks Ramesh bhai for initiating it. I (my parents still live there) live in Sadar near VCA and still hear the roaring crowds on a sixer during a cricket match.  I am in US since last 10 years and keep visiting Nagpur regularly. Last time i saw the new VCA stadium under construction near Airport. Yaah i too was impressed with the development and taken back with the soaring property prices. It is loosing its charm of a laid back city but with the bulging economy it will find its place as a leading tier 2 city?. Our family hold a decent property (3+ Acres) within 6 kms from zero miles and i am looking into selling it to a major real estate company or enter into a business venture. If anyone is interested please contact me.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-2589\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-2589\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a06625ee2d6b7ad17015593a14777ae?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a06625ee2d6b7ad17015593a14777ae?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\"><a href='http://www.atlantahomerealtor.com' rel='external nofollow' class='url'>Atlanta MLS Agent</a> </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-2589\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2009-01-03T21:23:13-07:00\">January 3, 2009 at 9:23 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Having visited many under developed places in the world, and some even in Atlanta, the access to information and the resources the internet offers is something all these places will need in order to reach their full potential.

It is nice to read the opinions about Nagpur.  A few have mentioned their desire to return to India.  I am in the same boat.  I am in the US for 20 years and have thought of returning to India.  Nagpur has its positives and negatives.  I love the city, but raising kids is a different issue.  The electricity water situation is scary.  The heat is another factor.  As somebody mentioned, did they find out more about solar power for domestic usein Nagpur (cost, etc). I am not in IT and obviosuly, do not have much prospect from a jo perspective in Nagpur.  But I am interested in setting up a venture of my own.  Thanks to Prof. Jain for the blog.  I will post more.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-2753\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-2753\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/436d05c87c7b25fc10f9667ff14cf033?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/436d05c87c7b25fc10f9667ff14cf033?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Sagar </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-2753\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2009-04-21T08:35:32-07:00\">April 21, 2009 at 8:35 am</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>Dear All,<br />\nPlease highlight this issue to save prosperity of Nagpur </p>\n<p>As from 17-May Qatar airways planning to stop operations from Nagpur to Doha that means people from vidharbha have no other option to fly Mumbai to catch flight for USA or UK or rest of the world.<br />\nWho is responsible for this? our (Vidharbhian) politician were just busy in fighting between themselves while enjoying ministers protocol in Last central Govt. and cities like Hyderabad and other benefits from that.<br />\nThis is bad news for the prosperity of Nagpur, if Qatar airways stop Nagpur operations from 17-May that means it will go very bad and wrong signal in international market for Nagpur and no other international flight will start operations to Nagpur.<br />\nFrom<br />\nSagar Gulhane &amp;<br />\nFriend circle belongs to Central India<br />\nLondon, UK</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</section><!-- .comment-content -->\n\n\t\t\t<div class=\"reply\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div><!-- .reply -->\n\t\t</article><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t</li><!-- #comment-## -->\n\t<li class=\"comment even thread-even depth-1\" id=\"li-comment-3055\">\n\t\t<article id=\"comment-3055\" class=\"comment\">\n\t\t\t<header class=\"comment-meta comment-author vcard\">\n\t\t\t\t<img alt='' src='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e2679b42c99f6ba7e5c751e398fb59ad?s=44&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g' srcset='https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e2679b42c99f6ba7e5c751e398fb59ad?s=88&#038;d=mm&#038;r=g 2x' class='avatar avatar-44 photo' height='44' width='44' /><cite class=\"fn\">Hema Shah </cite><a href=\"https://ngs.ics.uci.edu/visiting-nagpur/#comment-3055\"><time pubdate datetime=\"2009-09-23T15:05:25-07:00\">September 23, 2009 at 3:05 pm</time></a>\t\t\t</header><!-- .comment-meta -->\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<section class=\"comment-content comment\">\n\t\t\t\t<p>I spent about 6 years of my childhood in Nagpur.
