By ignoring the temporal aspects of an attack during the analysis and enforcement, the state-of-the-art approaches aimed at protecting the users against such attacks are prone to have low-coverage in detection and high-disruption in prevention of permission-induced attacks. To address the aforementioned shortcomings, we present Terminator, a temporal permission analysis and enforcement framework for Android. \n</p>\n\n<h3>How Terminator Works</h3>\n<p>\n    Leveraging temporal logic model checking, Terminator's analyzer identifies permission-induced threats with respect to dynamic permission states of the apps. At runtime, Terminator's enforcer selectively leases (i.e., temporarily grants) permissions to apps when the system is in a safe state, and revokes the permissions when the system moves to an unsafe state realizing the identified threats.\n    \n    <br><br><img style=\"margin:10\" ALT=\"[Terminator picture]\" height=\"250\" src=./Overview><br><br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Evaluation</h3>\n<p>\n    The results of our experiments, conducted over thousands of apps, indicate that Terminator is able to provide an effective, yet non-disruptive defense against permission-induced attacks. We also show that our approach, which does not require modification to the Android framework or apps' implementation logic, is highly reliable and widely applicable.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    The details of the evaluation results can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSanJlTt6liJexf8ubYUNzordfCOyjmouk2CMwJ2r8Q8chTqaBtHnYsUBTySyQUWAgdow2Unywjl7GG/pubhtml\">here</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Artifacts</h3>\n<p>\n    Our TLA+ model specifying the Android system with respect to permission-induced attacks can be found <a href=\"./tla_module.html\">here</a>.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Publications</h3>\n\nMore details about Terminator can be found in our publication:\n\n<ul class=\"paperlist\">\n  <li><b>A Temporal Permission Analysis and Enforcement Framework for Android</b><br> \n     Alireza Sadeghi, Reyhaneh Jabbarvand, Negar Ghorbani, Hamid Bagheri, and Sam Malek<br>\n    <i>International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), May 2018, Gothenburg, Sweden</i>\n    <!-- <br>[<a href=\"./2015TSE.pdf\">PDF</a>] -->\n    </li> \n</ul>\n\n\n<!-- ***************** End of content ****************** -->\n<br><br>\n<div style=\"float:left\">\n            <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~seal/\"><img ALT=\"[seal's logo]\" height=\"200\" src=../../seal.png></a>\n</div>\n<div style=\"float:right\">\n            <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu\"><img ALT=\"[uci's logo]\" style=\"padding-top: 40px\" height=\"100\" src=../../uci.jpg></a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>", "encoding": "ascii"}
