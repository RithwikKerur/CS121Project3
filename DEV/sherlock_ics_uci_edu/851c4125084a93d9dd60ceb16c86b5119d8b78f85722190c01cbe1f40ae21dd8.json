It is well recognized\r\n                  that the outcome of the analysis is only as good as the data on which\r\n                  the analysis is performed. That is why today organizations spend a tangible\r\n                  percent of their budgets on cleaning tasks such as removing duplicates,\r\n                  correcting errors, filling missing values, to improve data quality prior\r\n                  to pushing data through the analysis pipeline.<BR>\r\n                  <BR>\r\n                  Given the critical importance of the problem, many efforts, in both industry\r\n                  and academia, have explored systematic approaches to addressing the cleaning\r\n                  challenges. The work of our group focuses primarily on the <b>entity resolution</b> challenge\r\n                  that arises because objects in the real world are referred to using references\r\n                  or descriptions that are not always unique identifiers of the objects,\r\n                  leading to ambiguity.<BR>\r\n                  <BR>\r\n                  The traditional approach for entity resolution uses features associated with\r\n                  a reference (or a record) to find references that co-refer. In our project we are exploring\r\n                  which other sources and types of information could be used, in addition to features, to better\r\n                  disambiguate among references. This information could be present in that data being cleaned itself\r\n                  or can be obtained from external data sources, including ontologies, encyclopedias, and the Web.\r\n                  We are also looking into ways to guide and fine-tune the data cleaning process based\r\n                  on the type of analysis that will be done on the data being cleaned for it to reach higher\r\n                  disambiagution quality as well as efficiency.<BR>\r\n\t\t\t\t </p>\t\r\n\t\t\t\t  \r\n                  <h4>Past Work</h4>\r\n                <p align=\"justify\">\r\n\r\n                  As part of our project, in the past we have pioneered a novel entity resolution methodology which we refer to as\r\n                  Relationship-Based Data Cleaning (<b>RelDC</b>). RelDC relies upon the observation that many real-world\r\n                  datasets are <EM>relational</EM> in nature\r\n                  and contain not only information about entities but also relationships among them,\r\n                  knowledge of which can be used to disambiguate among representations more effectively.\r\n                  RelDC is a principled, domain-independent framework that\r\n                  exploits the <EM>entity-relationship graph</EM> of the dataset, and specifically\r\n                  relationships, for high-quality entity resolution that is self-tuning and requires minimal\r\n                  intervention by analysts.\r\n\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t <h4>Keywords</h4>\r\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"justify\">\r\n                  Entity Resolution, Data Cleaning, Data Cleansing, Information Quality, Data Quality.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h4>Acknowledgement</h4>\r\n                <p align=\"justify\">\r\n\t\tThis material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1118114\">1118114</a>.
