We discuss the challenges posed by the wide variety of\ndifferent sensor failures and anomalies present in the data. The volume and complexity of the data precludes the use of manual visualization or simple thresholding techniques to identify these anomalies. We describe the application of probabilistic modeling and unsupervised learning techniques to this data set and illustrate how these approaches can successfully detect underlying systematic patterns even in the presence of substantial noise and missing data.\n</p><hr />\n<p><a name='kdd08' id='kdd08'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Fast Collapsed Gibbs Sampling for Latent Dirichlet Allocation</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=kdd08.pdf'>PDF</a> ] | [ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=kdd08.ps'>PS</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Porteous, Newman, Ihler, Asuncion, Smyth, Welling</td><td  align='right'>in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) 2008.</td></tr>\n</table><p>In this paper we introduce a novel collapsed Gibbs sampling method for the widely used latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. Our new method results in significant speedups on real world text corpora. Conventional Gibbs sampling schemes for LDA require O(K) operations per sample where K is the number of topics in the model. Our proposed method draws equivalent samples but requires on average significantly less then K operations per sample. On real-word corpora FastLDA can be as much as 8 times faster than the standard collapsed Gibbs sampler for LDA. No approximations are necessary, and we show that our fast sampling scheme produces exactly the same results as the standard (but slower) sampling scheme. Experiments on four real world data sets demonstrate speedups for a wide range of collection sizes. For the PubMed collection of over 8 million documents with a required computation time of 6 CPU months for LDA, our speedup of 5.7 can save 5 CPU months of computation.\n</p><hr />\n<p><a name='uai08' id='uai08'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Adaptive Inference in General Graphical Models</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=uai08.pdf'>PDF</a> ] | [ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=uai08.ps'>PS</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Acar, Ihler, Mettu, Sumer</td><td  align='right'>in Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) 2008.</td></tr>\n</table><p>Many algorithms and applications involve repeatedly solving variations of the same inference problem; for example we may want to introduce new evidence to the model or perform updates to conditional dependencies.

From a statistical point of view, this process can be regarded as estimating many random variables which are related both spatially and temporally: given observations of some of these variables, typically corresponding to times past, we require estimates of several others, typically corresponding to future times.\n</p>\n<p class='vspace'>Graphical models have emerged as an effective formalism for assisting in these types of inference tasks, particularly for large numbers of random variables. Graphical models provide a means of representing dependency structure among the variables, and can provide both intuition and efficiency in estimation and other inference computations. We provide an overview and introduction to graphical models, and describe how they can be used to represent statistical dependency and how the resulting structure can be used to organize computation. The relation between statistical inference using graphical models and optimal sequential estimation algorithms such as Kalman filtering is discussed. We then give several additional examples of how graphical models can be applied to climate dynamics, specifically estimation using multi-resolution models of large-scale data sets such as satellite imagery, and learning hidden Markov models to capture rainfall patterns in space and time.\n</p><hr />\n<p class='vspace'><a name='tkdd07' id='tkdd07'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Learning to detect events with Markov-modulated Poisson processes</strong></td><td  align='right'>[  <a target='_blank'  class='urllink' href='http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1297332.1297337' rel='nofollow'>Link</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Ihler, Hutchins, Smyth</td><td  align='right'>ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol 1 Issue 3, Dec. 2007.</td></tr>\n</table><p>Time-series of count data occur in many different contexts, including Internet navigation logs, freeway traffic monitoring, and security logs associated with buildings. In this article we describe a framework for detecting anomalous events in such data using an unsupervised learning approach. Normal periodic behavior is modeled via a time-varying Poisson process model, which in turn is modulated by a hidden Markov process that accounts for bursty events. We outline a Bayesian framework for learning the parameters of this model from count time-series. Two large real-world datasets of time-series counts are used as testbeds to validate the approach, consisting of freeway traffic data and logs of people entering and exiting a building. We show that the proposed model is significantly more accurate at detecting known events than a more traditional threshold-based technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects, and to make inferences about different aspects of events such as number of vehicles or people involved. The results indicate that the Markov-modulated Poisson framework provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity.\n</p><hr />\n<p class='vspace'><a name='uai07' id='uai07'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Accuracy Bounds for Belief Propagation</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=uai07.pdf'>PDF</a> ] | [ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=uai07.ps'>PS</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Ihler</td><td  align='right'>in Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) 2007.</td></tr>\n</table><p>The belief propagation algorithm is widely applied to perform approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models, in part due to its excellent empirical properties and performance.

The application of these methods, however, requires some care due to a number of issues that are particular to sensor networks. Chief of among these are the distributed nature of computation and deployment coupled with communications bandwidth and energy constraints typical of many sensor networks. Additionally, information sharing in a sensor network necessarily involves approximation. Traditional measures of distortion are not sufficient to characterize the quality of approximation as they do not address in an explicit manner the resulting impact on inference which is at the core of many data fusion problems. While both graphical models and a distributed sensor network have network structures associated with them, the mapping is not one to one. All of these issues complicate the mapping of a particular inference problem to a given sensor network structure. Indeed, there may be a variety of mappings with very different characteristics with regard to computational complexity and utilization of resources. Nevertheless, it is the case that many of the powerful distributed inference methods have a role in information fusion for sensor networks. In this article we present an overview of research conducted by the authors that has sought to clarify many of the important issues at the intersection of these domains. We discuss both theoretical issues and prototypical applications in addition to suggesting new lines of reasoning.\n</p><hr />\n<p class='vspace'><a name='uai06' id='uai06'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Gibbs Sampling for (Coupled) Infinite Mixture Models in the Stick Breaking Representation</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=uai06.pdf'>PDF</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Porteous, Ihler, Smyth, Welling</td><td  align='right'>in Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) 2006.</td></tr>\n</table><p>Nonparametric Bayesian approaches to clustering, information retrieval, language modeling and object recognition have recently shown great promise as a new paradigm for unsupervised data analysis. Most contributions have focused on the Dirichlet process mixture models or extensions thereof for which efficient Gibbs samplers exist. In this paper we explore Gibbs samplers for infinite complexity mixture models in the stick breaking representation. The advantage of this representation is improved modeling flexibility. For instance, one can design the prior distribution over cluster sizes or couple multiple infi- nite mixture models (e.g., over time) at the level of their parameters (i.e., the dependent Dirichlet process model). However, Gibbs samplers for in- finite mixture models (as recently introduced in the statistics literature) seem to mix poorly over cluster labels. Among others issues, this can have the adverse effect that labels for the same cluster in coupled mixture models are mixed up. We introduce additional moves in these samplers to improve mixing over cluster labels and to bring clusters into correspondence. An application to modeling of storm trajectories is used to illustrate these ideas.\n</p><hr />\n<p class='vspace'><a name='kdd06' id='kdd06'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Adaptive Event Detection with Time-Varying Poisson Processes</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=kdd06.pdf'>PDF</a> ] | [ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=kdd06.ps'>PS</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Ihler, Hutchins, Smyth</td><td  align='right'>in Knoweldge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) 2006.</td></tr>\n</table><p>Time-series of count data are generated in many different contexts, such as web access logging, freeway traffic monitoring, and security logs associated with buildings. Since this data measures the aggregated behavior of individual human beings, it typically exhibits a periodicity in time on a number of scales (daily, weekly,etc.) that reflects the rhythms of the underlying human activity and makes the data appear non-homogeneous. At the same time, the data is often corrupted by a number of bursty periods of unusual behavior such as building events, traffic accidents, and so forth. The data mining problem of finding and extracting these anomalous events is made difficult by both of these elements. In this paper we describe a framework for unsupervised learning in this context, based on a time-varying Poisson process model that can also account for anomalous events. We show how the parameters of this model can be learned from count time series using statistical estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility of this model on two datasets for which we have partial ground truth in the form of known events, one from freeway traffic data and another from building access data, and show that the model performs significantly better than a non-probabilistic, threshold-based technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects, and make inferences about the detected events (e.g., popularity or level of attendance). Our experimental results indicate that the proposed time-varying Poisson model provides a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity.\n</p><hr />\n<p class='vspace'><a name='nips06' id='nips06'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Learning Time-Intensity Profiles of Human Activity Using Nonparametric Bayesian Models</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=nips06.pdf'>PDF</a> ] | [ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=nips06.ps'>PS</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Ihler, Smyth</td><td  align='right'>in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2006.</td></tr>\n</table><p>Data sets that characterize human activity over time through collections of timestamped events or counts are of increasing interest in application areas as humancomputer interaction, video surveillance, and Web data analysis. We propose a non-parametric Bayesian framework for modeling collections of such data. In particular, we use a Dirichlet process framework for learning a set of intensity functions corresponding to different categories, which form a basis set for representing individual time-periods (e.g., several days) depending on which categories the time-periods are assigned to. This allows the model to learn in a data-driven fashion what \u00c2\u201cfactors\u00c2\u201d are generating the observations on a particular day, including (for example) weekday versus weekend effects or day-specific effects corresponding to unique (single-day) occurrences of unusual behavior, sharing information where appropriate to obtain improved estimates of the behavior associated with each category.

We analyze the effect resulting from message approximation under two particular measures of error, and show bounds on the accumulation of errors in the system.

In general, self-localization involves the combination of absolute location information (\\eg GPS) with relative calibration information (\\eg distance measurements between sensors) over regions of the network. Furthermore, it is generally desirable to distribute the computational burden across the network and minimize the amount of inter-sensor communication. We demonstrate that the information used for sensor localization is fundamentally local with regard to the network topology and use this observation to reformulate the problem within a graphical model framework. We then present and demonstrate the utility of \\emph{nonparametric belief propagation} (NBP), a recent generalization of particle filtering, for both estimating sensor locations and representing location uncertainties. NBP has the advantage that it is easily implemented in a distributed fashion, admits a wide variety of statistical models, and can represent multi-modal uncertainty. Using simulations of small- to moderately-sized sensor networks, we show that NBP may be made robust to outlier measurement errors by a simple model augmentation, and that judicious message construction can result in better estimates. Furthermore, we provide an analysis of NBP's communications requirements, showing that typically only a few messages per sensor are required, and that even low bit-rate approximations of these messages can have little or no performance impact.\n</p><hr />\n<p class='vspace'><a name='ssp05' id='ssp05'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Particle Filtering Under Communications Constraints</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=ssp05.pdf'>PDF</a> ] | [ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=ssp05.ps'>PS</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Ihler, Fisher, Willsky</td><td  align='right'>in Statistical Signal Processing (SSP) 2005.</td></tr>\n</table><p>Particle filtering is often applied to the problem of object tracking under non-Gaussian uncertainty; however, sensor networks frequently require that the implementation be local to the region of interest, eventually forcing the large, sample-based representation to be moved among power-constrained sensors.

The first set captures the structure of the statistical dependencies within each hypothesis, while the second set measures the details of model differences between hypotheses. We then consider the case when the signal prior models are unknown, so that the distributions of interest must be estimated directly from data, showing that the second set of terms is (asymptotically) negligible and quantifying the loss in hypothesis separability when the models are completely unknown. We demonstrate the utility of nonparametric estimation methods for such problems, providing a general framework for determining and distinguishing between dependency structures in highly uncertain environments. Additionally, we develop a machine learning approach for estimating lower bounds on KL-divergence and mutual information from samples of high-dimensional random variables for which direct density estimation is infeasible. We present empirical results in the context of three prototypical applications: association of signals generated by sources possessing harmonic behavior, scene correspondence using video imagery, and detection of coherent behavior among sets of moving objects.\n</p><hr />\n<p class='vspace'><a name='nips04' id='nips04'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Message Errors in Belief Propagation</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=nips04.pdf'>PDF</a> ] | [ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=nips04.ps'>PS</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Ihler, Fisher, Willsky</td><td  align='right'>in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2004.</td></tr>\n</table><p>Belief propagation (BP) is an increasingly popular method of performing approximate inference on arbitrary graphical models.

Stochastic methods such as particle filters provide an appealing alternative. However, existing techniques fail to exploit the rich structure of the graphical models describing many vision problems. Drawing on ideas from regularized particle filters and belief propagation (BP), this paper develops a nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) algorithm applicable to general graphs. Each NBP iteration uses an efficient sampling procedure to update kernel-based approximations to the true, continuous likelihoods. The algorithm can accomodate an extremely broad class of potential functions, including nonparametric representations. Thus, NBP extends particle filtering methods to the more general vision problems that graphical models can describe. We apply the NBP algorithm to infer component interrelationships in a parts-based face model, allowing location and reconstruction of occluded features.\n</p><hr />\n<p class='vspace'><a name='nips03' id='nips03'></a>\n</p>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'><strong>Efficient Multiscale Sampling from Products of Gaussian Mixtures</strong></td><td  align='right'>[ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=nips03.pdf'>PDF</a> ] | [ <a class='wikilink' href='http://sli.ics.uci.edu/Pubs/Pubs?action=download&amp;upname=nips03.ps'>PS</a> ]</td></tr>\n</table>\n<table border='0' width='90%' ><tr ><td  align='left'>Ihler, Sudderth, Freeman, Willsky</td><td  align='right'>in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2003.</td></tr>\n</table><p>The problem of approximating the product of several Gaussian mixture distributions arises in a number of contexts, including the nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) inference algorithm and the training of product of experts models.

In highly uncertain environments, one may need to determine this correspondence without the benefit of an \\emph{a priori} known joint signal/sensor model. This paper examines the data association problem as the more general hypothesis test between factorizations of a single, learned distribution. The optimal test between known distributions may be decomposed into model-dependent and statistical dependence terms, quantifying the cost incurred by model estimation from measurements compared to a test between known models. We demonstrate how one might evaluate a two-signal association test efficiently using kernel density estimation methods to model a wide class of possible distributions, and show the resulting algorithm's ability to determine correspondence in uncertain conditions through a series of synthetic examples. We then describe an extension of this technique to multi-signal association which can be used to determine correspondence while avoiding the computationally prohibitive task of evaluating all hypotheses.

Classical stochastic models\nmake a number of simplifying assumptions to improve tractability (e.g. linear dynam-\nics, Gaussian uncertainty). While such assumptions lead to algorithms which are both\nfast and optimal under the assumptions, there are a great many real world problems\nfor which these assumptions are false. Recently, computational power has increased\nto the point where another method becomes feasible \u2013 purely example-based, or \u201cnon-\nparametric\u201d, models. Yet these are limited because their computational requirements\ngrow exponentially with the number of variables we observe about the system. For\ndynamical systems, in which we generally observe the past, this means that processes\nwith any substantial past-dependence become intractable.

Furthermore, the uncertainty of the prediction is characterized nonparametrically by a joint density over the learned statistic and present observation. We discuss the application of the technique to both noise driven dynamical systems and random processes sampled from a density which is conditioned on the past. In the first case we show results in which both the dynamics of random walk and the statistics of the driving noise are captured. In the second case we present results in which a summarizing statistic is learned on noisy random telegraph waves with differing dependencies on past states. In both cases the algorithm yields a principled approach for discriminating processes with differing dynamics and/or dependencies.
