In particular, group communication is often crucial \n            in battlefield and law enforcement operations. Regardless of the \n            environment, security services are necessary to provide communication \n            privacy and integrity. These are not possible without secure and \n            efficient key distribution, authentication and other security mechanisms. \n            </p>\n            <p><font size=\"4\" color=\"#008800\"><img src=\"images/banner22.gif\"\n             border=\"0\" alt=\"Banner Text\" class=\"namo-bullet1\"> Motivation <br>\n            </font>While peer-to-peer security is a well-developed field, secure \n            group communication remains relatively unexplored. The prime motivation \n            for CLIQUES is the lack of a general-purpose group security solution \n            that satisfies the requirements of modern group communication security. \n            </p>\n            <p><font size=\"4\" color=\"#008800\"><img src=\"images/banner22.gif\"\n             border=\"0\" alt=\"Banner Text\" class=\"namo-bullet1\"> Goal <br>\n            </font>The primary goal of the CLIQUES project is to design a suite \n            of highly secure key distribution, authentication and other auxiliary \n            protocols for group communication. These protocols will be subsequently \n            realized in a general-purpose CLIQUES toolkit which, additionally, \n            will address the challenges of communication latency and state. \n            The resulting technology will be demonstrated in different application \n            domains. </p>\n            <p><font size=\"4\" color=\"#008800\"><img src=\"images/banner22.gif\"\n             border=\"0\" alt=\"Banner Text\" class=\"namo-bullet1\"> Group Setting \n            <br>\n            </font>CLIQUES supports dynamic group membership in response to \n            the actual requirements of current and emerging group-oriented applications \n            for dynamic peer group. Group membership operations at the granularity \n            of individual members and entire sub-groups is addressed in a secure \n            and efficient manner. Dynamic peer groups are relatively small, \n            non-hierarchical groups typically geared for replication or collaborative \n            applications. CLIQUES favors neither a specific network topology \n            not a specific communication paradigm. </p>\n            <p><font size=\"4\" color=\"#008800\"><img src=\"images/banner22.gif\"\n             border=\"0\" alt=\"Banner Text\" class=\"namo-bullet1\"> Security <br>\n            </font>CLIQUES supports highly secure operation. Its protocols are \n            the group extensions of the well-known Diffie-Hellman key exchange. \n            CLIQUES provides authenticated contributory key agreement which \n            guarantees key independence, key confirmation, perfect forward secrecy, \n            and resistance to known key attacks.
