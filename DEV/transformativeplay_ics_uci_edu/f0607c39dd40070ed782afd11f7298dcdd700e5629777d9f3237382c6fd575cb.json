School of Information and Computer Sciences</h4><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Thursday 3:30pm-6:20pm</h4><h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Location: ICS 180</h4><h1>Catalog Description</h1><p>The &#8220;disappearing computer&#8221; paradigm. Differences to the desktop computing model: applications, interaction in augmented environments, security, alternate media, small operating systems, sensors, and embedded systems design. Evaluation by project work and class participation.</p><h1>Course Overview</h1><p>The emergence of the \u201cubiquitous computing\u201d paradigm in the late 1980s introduced a series of significant challenges for research and practice in human-computer interaction, by moving the locus of interaction from the person sitting at a desk in front of a PC to the person moving through a world suffused with devices and information. This has supported an expansion of HCI\u2019s topics to include questions of spatiality, tangibility and experience. The recent explosion in sensor networks, so-called \u201cbig data\u201d, and the distributed collection of loosely-affiliated devices grouped under the heading of the \u201cinternet-of-things\u201d has further stretched the concept of Ubiquitous Computing to the point where it is hard to define. Thus, we find ourselves in an introductory course to a topic that no longer properly exists. In this class we will explore the history of Ubicomp in a collaborative research context to better understand the central challenges and questions driving contemporary ubiquitous computing theory and practice.</p><p><strong>BIG DISCLAIMER! </strong>Be prepared to read. Be prepared to think. Be prepared to research. Be prepared to write. Your work will be evaluated based on these four factors.</p><h1>Course Resources</h1><h2>Slack</h2><p>We will be using Slack as a discussion board and collective backchannel during class discussions. The URL for the Slack Channel is: <a href=\"http://inf241.slack.com\">http://inf241.slack.com</a></p><h2>Zotero</h2><p>Everyone is required to use Zotero to manage their bibliographic references. We will also use a shared Zotero library to identify and claim readings to discuss in class. The URL for the Zotero Group is: <a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/groups/1757468/inf_241_-_intro_to_ubiquitous_computing\">https://www.zotero.org/groups/1757468/inf_241_-_intro_to_ubiquitous_computing</a></p><h2>What you should bring:</h2><p>Always make certain you have a laptop or tablet with you in class, a pencil or pen, and access to the readings.</p><h1>Course Structure</h1><p>We meet once a week for three hours. Classes will be a combination of lectures, small group discussion, and presentation to the class.</p><h2>Readings, Lecture, + Discussion</h2><p>Each week you will be responsible for reading two to four papers relevant to the field of Ubiquitous Computing.\u00a0 The first papers are ones that I will assign ahead of time, related to that week\u2019s theme.\u00a0 I will lead a discussion of that paper during the first half of class. On three weeks that I will <em>not</em> specify ahead of time you will be given a reading response quiz in-class for a grade.</p><h2>Small Group Discussion and Presentation of Readings</h2><p>Each week, every student is responsible for locating and bringing a scholarly article to discuss with the class, related to that week\u2019s topic. We will be using Zotero to claim articles, and to prevent duplicate selections. Once you have found an article, add it to the Shared Zotero Collection for that week, and add a note with your name to \u201cclaim\u201d it. The longer you wait to find an article, the harder it will be for you to find something relevant to the topic at hand worth discussing. Be sure to check Zotero while searching for articles to see what has already been claimed. \u00a0Scholarly articles include research publications, trade and professional publications, and in rare cases mainstream news publications, however the latter must first be cleared by the instructor.</p><p>Once you have identified an article that is relevant to the topic, and of interest to you, be prepared to discuss it in class.\u00a0 We will divide into small groups each week and every group member will have a chance to present their article of choice.\u00a0 After a short period of discussion, the group will nominate one person to present an article to the class. Presenters can talk about what the article says, why it was chosen, why it\u2019s important, and what was learned from it. Be aware that this is not etched in stone; there is significant flexibility in how you present, however these are general themes that should be touched on.</p><p>Presentations and participation in group discussion are part of your participation grade so try to bring something engaging and relevant.</p><h1>Grading and Evaluations</h1><p>Grades will be based on the following factors:</p><ul><li>Group Project/ Prototype 50% of Grade</li><li>Participation in Class and Online Discussions 30% of Grade</li><li>Reading Response Quizzes 15% of Grade</li><li>Index Cards/Attendance 5% of Grade</li></ul><h2><strong>Group Project/Prototype</strong> (50% of Grade)</h2><ul><li><strong>Recommended Number of People: </strong>3-6</li><li><strong>Deadlines:</strong><ul><li>10/26 &#8211; Week 4 \u2013 Initial concept pitch (in class)</li><li>11/23 \u2013 Week 8 \u2013 Paper drafts due (via email, before 3pm)</li><li>12/14 \u2013 Finals Week \u2013 Final presentation of documentation and final papers due before class @ 3pm.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Project Formats:</strong><ul><li><strong>Working Prototype or App:</strong> Working prototype of a new ubiquitous computing system or app that <em>critically engages </em>with the ideas and concepts discussed in class.</li><li><strong>\u201cFully Elaborated\u201d Design Fiction: </strong>A detailed \u201cwizard of OZ\u201d vision of a fictional technology, presented using film, animation, or illustrated prose that persuasively articulates a new sociotechnical future, or effectively critiques contemporary ubicomp practices.</li><li><strong>\u201cCritical Design\u201d or Artwork: </strong>An artifact or system that embodies a critique of ubiquitous or pervasive computing technology by magnifying or countering an existing trend (taking it to a dystopian or utopian extreme) in technology and society.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Project Deliverables:</strong><ul><li><strong>Documentation (40% of project grade): </strong>A video demonstrating the functionality of your system (prototypes/apps), or documenting the artifact that you created (critical designs/artworks).

This paper can be no longer than 8 pages, not including references.<ul><li><u>Introduction</u> \u2013 What did you make? Why did you make it? What motivated the work? What does it contribute to the field?</li><li><u>Background/Prior Work</u> \u2013 Who has done similar work in the field? Where are the gaps/opportunities to improve? What are the theories, concepts, or ideas that a reader needs to understand to make sense of your project?</li><li><u>Design Process</u> \u2013 How did you approach the project? What ideas were discarded along the way and why? What did you initially envision, and how has it changed? What did you learn from the design process?</li><li><u>(OPTIONAL) Evaluation</u> \u2013 How did people use/react to the thing you made? What did you learn from watching people use it, or asking them about it? If your thing is attempting to solve a problem that is quantifiable, what are the numbers underlying your system\u2019s success or failure?</li><li><u>Discussion</u> \u2013 How does the thing you made connect to the theory, background, prior work etc.? What are the ideas that it expresses or explores?</li><li><u>Conclusions &amp; Future Work</u> \u2013 How do you connect this work to the broader concerns of HCI and/or Ubiquitous Computing? What do you think the next steps for this project should be?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Documentation Grading Criteria:</strong><ul><li><strong>Effective use of the medium: </strong>Did you choose the appropriate medium to best document and communicate your design? Have you used the vocabulary of your chosen medium effectively?</li><li><strong>Engagement with ideas: </strong>Does your design engage with the ideas from the class? Does it extend or critique them?</li><li><strong>Engagement with values and ethics: </strong>What are the moral and ethical implications of your design? Who benefits from your design? Who suffers? Who is included? Who is excluded?</li><li><strong>Polish: </strong>Is your documentation pleasing to look at and listen to? Does it communicate clearly?</li><li><strong>Documentation of sources: </strong>Have you clearly documented and properly credited the sources for any 3<sup>rd</sup>-party materials you may have used in your documentation including art assets, audio, code, etc.?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Reflection Grading Criteria:</strong><ul><li><strong>Clarity of Communication: </strong>Is your writing clear? Do you use proper spelling and grammar throughout? Are your sentences concise and effective? Are your ideas accessible and understandable? Do you use figures, charts, and tables to effectively convey visual information? Are you writing using \u201cactive voice\u201d wherever possible?</li><li><strong>Structure and Organization:</strong> Is your paper well structured? Do you effectively use headings and other navigation markers to guide your reader through the paper? Do you use effective signposting techniques to help the reader know what is coming up next?</li><li><strong>Depth of Research and References: </strong>Have you identified and accurately portrayed the related work in the field? Is your work drawing effectively on materials from the class? Is there evidence of additional research beyond the course materials? Are your references properly formatted with correct in-text citation practices? Are direct quotes properly marked (quotation marks, indentation, and page numbers), and is it clear when you are presenting your ideas vs. someone else\u2019s?</li><li><strong>Coherence of Argument: </strong>Do you clearly state your argument? Do you effectively support your argument with evidence? Does your paper provide enough information to make your point, without getting repetitive, pedantic, or obtuse? Do you anticipate and address possible critiques of your argument? Have you clearly identified your research questions? Does your paper effectively address those questions?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>You will note that in none of these criteria are you being evaluated on the specific idea or argument you are making.\u00a0 This means that you are free to pursue designs and ideas that are bad, uninteresting, impractical, silly, absurd, impossible, unlikely, challenging, upsetting, depressing, inspiring, revolutionary, broad reaching, reductive, playful, subversive, and any other qualities you can imagine. But, no matter how bizarre or absurd your idea is, you need to research it deeply, connect it to the ideas and issues we discuss in class, and argue for it strongly and effectively. Bad/weird/unconventional ideas can be much harder to defend than good ideas, but a well defended idea that isn\u2019t within the normal discourse of the field can be a significant contribution.</p><h2>Participation in Class and Online Discussions (30% of grade)</h2><p>This grade is a measure of how successfully I believe you have engaged with the class. This might take the form of participating in class discussions, posting on the Slack channel, being selected to present your paper within your groups, and any other indicators of engagement I might choose to designate.</p><h2>Reading Response Quizzes (15% of Grade)</h2><p>I will assign three reading response quizzes to be completed in class this quarter. Each one will be worth 5% of your grade. I will not announce when these will be assigned until we are in-class on the day they are due. These quizzes will be distributed on paper, and will be collected and graded by the reader. You may use any printed/handwritten notes you want, but may not refer to the original paper, or use a digital device to search the web for answers. The goal of these quizzes is to hold you accountable for doing the readings, and the content and format of them will reflect this goal.</p><h2>Index Cards/Attendance (5% of Grade)</h2><p>Class attendance will be determined by completing index cards. The index cards are also a means for me to get feedback about the course. The reader will distribute the cards at the beginning of the class and collect them at the end. For each class please write your name on a card, the date, your student ID and a comment about the course.</p><p>If you would like to submit an anonymous comment, take an extra card and don&#8217;t put your name on it.</p><h1>Schedule and Materials</h1><h2>Week 0 \u2013 9/28 \u2013 Introductions and Origin Stories</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByXU8gAAONgobnBDRkR1ck1ENEU/view?usp=sharing\">Introduction to the class</a></li><li>Zotero tutorial</li><li>Group formation</li><li>Read: Mark Weiser. 1991.

Academic dishonesty includes, for example, cheating on examinations or any assignment, plagiarism of any kind (including improper citation of sources), having someone else take an examination or complete an assignment for you (or doing this for someone else), or any activity in which you represent someone else\u2019s work as your own. Violations of academic integrity will be referred to the Office of Academic Integrity and Student Conduct. The impact on your grade will be determined by the individual instructor\u2019s policies. Please familiarize yourself with UCI\u2019s Academic Integrity Policy (<a href=\"https://aisc.uci.edu/policies/academic-integrity/index.php\">https://aisc.uci.edu/policies/academic-integrity/index.php</a>) and speak to your instructor if you have any questions about what is and is not allowed in this course</em>.&#8221; (quote source: <a href=\"https://aisc.uci.edu/faculty-staff/academic-integrity.php\">https://aisc.uci.edu/faculty-staff/academic-integrity.php</a>)</p><p>When writing your final papers, all group members will be held EQUALLY responsible for any plagiarism, regardless of who actually wrote what in the paper. Your drafts and final papers <strong>WILL BE CHECKED FOR PLAGIARISM</strong>.</p><p>The penalty for plagiarism is at a minimum to receive a 0 on the assignment and have the case reported to the Associate Dean\u2019s office.

You must let the reader know which you are doing.</p><ol><li>If you quote the source directly, you must<ol><li>put quotation marks before and after that person\u2019s words;</li><li>let the reader know the source by (1) putting a footnote or endnote number at the end of the quotation, or (2) putting at least the source\u2019s name in parentheses after the quotation marks (such as when being taken from fieldwork).</li></ol></li><li>If you paraphrase (a paraphrase is about the same length as the original, but in different words) or if you summarize (a summary is a severely shortened version of the original), you must<ol><li>introduce the source in some manner at the beginning of the passage being paraphrased (or summarized) so that the reader can tell where your idea stops and the other person\u2019s begins;</li><li>state the ideas taken from the source in your own words and your own arrangement. It is possible to plagiarize sentence patterns as well as exact words. A handy rule: if, in a paraphrase or summary, you use a stretch of more than three words in their exact order from a source, you should put those words into quotation marks;</li><li>provide an exact source citation for those ideas paraphrased or summarized. This may be done either by footnote/endnote number at the end of the passages or by parenthetical references to the work and page(s). This citation provides credit to the author being used and allows the reader access to the material for further study.</li></ol></li><li>You must also provide a footnote for any chart, graph, figure, table, summary, or other data taken directly from another source or any information derived from such materials. You should also be sure to check copyright as to whether you are allowed to use this figure.</li></ol><p>For example, the text here on plagiarism was initially written Gillian Hayes for the Winter 2013 version of her INF 242 class, although some modifications and additions of my own have been integrated into it. The original can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.gillianhayes.com/Inf242w13/\">http://www.gillianhayes.com/Inf242w13/</a>, along with Professor Hayes\u2019 own disclaimer that the material has been \u201cgenerously borrowed and slightly modified from the UTC Center for Advisement and Student Success.\u201d</p><p>Oftentimes plagiarism isn\u2019t intentional \u2013 it happens because the writer either isn\u2019t in the habit of citation, or because the overhead of citing sources turns the process into a burden. I strenuously advise you to adopt the use of a reference management system if you do not already use one.\u00a0 This is one of the single best investments of your time you can undertake as a graduate student, and it will reward you a thousand times over once you have integrated it into your workflow.\u00a0 There are many great options out there at this point.\u00a0 I used EndNote for a long time, before it got crufty and slow.\u00a0 The university library officially supports Mendeley but I am not particularly familiar with it.\u00a0 I\u2019ve moved all of my bibliographic management tasks over to Zotero in the last year, and I am extremely happy with it: it\u2019s free, it works as both a stand-alone program, and as a browser plug-in, it integrates very smoothly with Word, it has great collaboration support, it has AMAZING citation scrapers for the major online repositories (ACM DL, JSTOR, Springer, etc.), and it has a very complete database of reference formats that are easy to install.\u00a0 Did I mention that it\u2019s FREE?\u00a0 It is! For more information about the options out there, the UCI Library has a good resource here: <a href=\"http://libguides.lib.uci.edu/content.php?pid=19606&amp;sid=583269\">http://libguides.lib.uci.edu/content.php?pid=19606&amp;sid=583269</a>.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t<!-- Begin Footer Section -->\n\t<footer id=\"footer\">\n        <div class=\"container\">\n            <div class=\"row\">\n                            </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n            <div class=\"copyrights\">\n                <p>                    <span> | Theme by <a href=\"http://themeegg.com/\"\n                                                                          target=\"_blank\">Themeegg</a></span>\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\t\t        \t\n            \n        </div>\n    </footer>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/themes/builder-lite/assets/vendor/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.js?ver=3.3.7'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/themes/builder-lite/assets/js/jquery.easing.1.3.js?ver=1.3'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/themes/builder-lite/assets/js/modernizr.js?ver=2.6.2'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/themes/builder-lite/assets/js/parallax.js?ver=1.4.2'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/themes/builder-lite/assets/vendor/magnific-popup/jquery.magnific-popup.js?ver=1.1.0'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/themes/builder-lite/assets/js/builder-lite-main.js?ver=1.0.0'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-includes/js/wp-embed.min.js?ver=5.2.3'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/plugins/elementor/assets/js/frontend-modules.js?ver=2.5.11'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-includes/js/jquery/ui/position.min.js?ver=1.11.4'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/plugins/elementor/assets/lib/dialog/dialog.min.js?ver=4.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/plugins/elementor/assets/lib/waypoints/waypoints.min.js?ver=4.0.2'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/plugins/elementor/assets/lib/swiper/swiper.min.js?ver=4.4.6'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript'>\nvar elementorFrontendConfig = {\"environmentMode\":{\"edit\":false,\"wpPreview\":false},\"is_rtl\":false,\"breakpoints\":{\"xs\":0,\"sm\":480,\"md\":768,\"lg\":1025,\"xl\":1440,\"xxl\":1600},\"version\":\"2.5.11\",\"urls\":{\"assets\":\"https:\\/\\/transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu\\/wp-content\\/transformativeplay\\/plugins\\/elementor\\/assets\\/\"},\"settings\":{\"page\":[],\"general\":{\"elementor_global_image_lightbox\":\"yes\",\"elementor_enable_lightbox_in_editor\":\"yes\"}},\"post\":{\"id\":917,\"title\":\"INF 241 - Introduction to Ubiquitous Computing\",\"excerpt\":\"\"}};\n</script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='https://transformativeplay.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/transformativeplay/plugins/elementor/assets/js/frontend.min.js?ver=2.5.11'></script>\n\n</body>\n</html>", "encoding": "utf-8"}
