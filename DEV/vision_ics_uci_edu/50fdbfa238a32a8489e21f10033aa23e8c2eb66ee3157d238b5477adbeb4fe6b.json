Object detection is a building block for a wide\nrange of  applications including self-driving cars, robotics and face recognition. Though\nsignificant progress has been achieved in these tasks, it is still challenging to obtain\nrobust results in unconstrained images. Real world scenes usually contain more than one\nobject and it is very likely that some parts of an object are occluded by other objects\nin the scene. To tackle occlusion, image features generated by occlusion should be explicitly\nmodeled rather than treated as noise. In this thesis, a deformable part model for detection\nand keypoint localization is introduced  that explicitly models part occlusion. The proposed\nmodel structure makes it possible to augment positive training data with large numbers of\nsynthetically occluded instances. This allows us to easily incorporate the statistics of\nocclusion patterns in a discriminatively trained model. To exploit bottom-up cues such as\noccluding contours and image segments, we extend the proposed model to utilize bottom-up\nclass-specific segmentation in order to jointly detect and segment out the foreground\npixels belonging to the object.\n\nIn these approaches, a detector for a single object category is trained which operates\nindependently of other detections in the scene. An appealing alternative approach for\ndetection in cluttered images is to move from single object detection to whole-image\nparsing. The presence of occlusion can then be \u201cexplained away\u201d by the presence of an\noccluding object. We model multi-object detection by classifying each pixel of the image\n(semantic segmentation) using Convolutional Neural Network. CNN architectures have terrific\nrecognition performance but rely on spatial pooling which makes it difficult to adapt them\nto tasks that require dense, pixel-accurate labeling. We demonstrate that while the\napparent spatial resolution of convolutional feature maps is low, the high-dimensional feature\nrepresentation contains significant sub-pixel localization information. We describe a\nmulti-resolution reconstruction architecture based on a Laplacian pyramid that uses skip\nconnections from higher resolution feature maps and multiplicative gating to successively\nrefine segment boundaries reconstructed from lower-resolution maps. We demonstrate that this\napproach yields state-of-the-art semantic segmentation results without resorting to more\ncomplex random-field inference or instance detection driven architectures.\n\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/Ghiasi_THESIS_2016/Ghiasi_THESIS_2016.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nGolnaz Ghiasi.\n<em>Recognizing and Segmenting Objects in the Presence of Occlusion and Clutter</em>.\nPhD thesis, University of California, Irvine, 11 2016.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@phdthesis{Ghiasi_THESIS_2016,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = \"Ghiasi, Golnaz\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = \"Recognizing and Segmenting Objects in the Presence of Occlusion and Clutter\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booktitle = \"PhD Thesis\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school = \"University of California, Irvine\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2016\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;month = \"11\"<br>\n}<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2017 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
