Our visual system\ncan easily handle ambiguous settings, like partial occlusions or large variations in viewpoint.\nOne hypothesis that explains this ability is that we process the scene as a global instance.\nUsing global contextual reasoning  (\\eg a car sits on a road, but not on a building facade)\ncan constrain interpretations of objects to plausible, coherent precepts.\nThis type of reasoning has been explored in Computer Vision using weak 2D context, mostly\nextracted from monocular cues. In this thesis, we explore the benefits of strong\n3D context extracted from multiple-view geometry. We demonstrate strong ties between\ngeometric reasoning and object recognition, effectively bridging\nthe gap between them to improve scene understanding.\n\nIn the first part of this thesis, we describe the basic principles of\nstructure from motion, which provide strong and reliable\ngeometric models that can be used for contextual scene understanding.\nWe present a novel algorithm for camera localization that leverages\nsearch space partitioning to allow a more aggressive filtering of\npotential correspondences. We exploit image covisibility using a\ncoarse-to-fine, prioritized search approach that can recognize scene\nlandmarks rapidly. This system achieves state of the art results in large-scale camera\nlocalization, especially in difficult scenes with frequently repeated structures.\n\nIn the second part of this thesis, we study how to exploit\nthese strong geometric models and localized cameras to improve recognition. We introduce\nan unsupervised training pipeline to generate scene-specific object detectors.\nThese classifiers outperform state of the art and can be used when\nthe rough camera location is known. When precise camera pose is available,\nwe can inject additional geometric cues into novel re-scoring framework to\nfurther improve detection. We demonstrate\nthe utility of background scene models for false positive pruning, akin to\nvideo-surveillance background subtraction strategies. Finally, we observe that the\nincreasing availability of mapping data stored in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)\nprovides strong geo-semantic information that can be used when cameras are located\nin world coordinates. We propose a novel contextual reasoning pipeline that\nuses lifted 2D GIS models to quickly retrieve precise geo-semantic priors.\nWe use these cues to to improve object detection and image semantic segmentation, providing a\nsuccessful trade-off of false positives that boosts average precision over baseline detection models.\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/Diaz_THESIS_2016/Diaz_THESIS_2016.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nRa\u00fal D\u00edaz.\n<em>Strong Geometric Context for Scene Understanding</em>.\nPhD thesis, University of California, Irvine, 10 2016.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@phdthesis{Diaz_THESIS_2016,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = \"D{\\'\\i}az, Ra{\\'u}l\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = \"Strong Geometric Context for Scene Understanding\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booktitle = \"PhD Thesis\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school = \"University of California, Irvine\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2016\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;month = \"10\"<br>\n}<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2017 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
