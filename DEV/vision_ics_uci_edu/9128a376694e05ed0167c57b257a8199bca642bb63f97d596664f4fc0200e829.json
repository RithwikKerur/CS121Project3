We focus on two problems which challenge current state-of-the-art trackers.  First, we address the challenge of long-term occlusion.  For this challenge, a tracker must know when it has lost track and how to reinitialize tracking when the target reappears.  We tackle reinitialization by building good appearance models for humans and hands, with a particular emphasis on robustness and occlusion.  For the second challenge, appearance variation, the tracker must know when and how to re-learn (or update) an appearance model.  Common solutions to this challenge encounter  the  classic  problem  of  drift:  aggressively  learning  putative  appearance  changes allows small errors to compound, as elements of the background environment pollute the appearance model.  We propose two solutions.  First, we consider self-paced learning, wherein a  tracker  begins  by  learning  from  frames  it  finds  easy.   As  the  tracker  becomes  better  at recognizing the target, it begins to learn from harder frames.  We also develop a data-driven approach in which we train a tracking policy to decide when and how to update an appearance model.  To take this direct approach to learning when to learn, we exploit large-scale Internet  data  through  reinforcement  learning.   We  interpret  the  resulting  policy  and  conclude with extensions for tracking multiple objects.  By solving these tracking challenges, we advance applications in augmented reality, vehicle automation, healthcare, and security.\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/Supancic_THESIS_2017/Supancic_THESIS_2017.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nJames&nbsp;Steven Supan\\vc i\\vc .\n<em>Long-Term Tracking by Decision Making</em>.\nPhD thesis, University of California, Irvine, 6 2017.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@phdthesis{Supancic_THESIS_2017,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = \"Supan{\\vc}i{\\vc}, James Steven\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = \"Long-Term Tracking by Decision Making\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booktitle = \"PhD Thesis\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;school = \"University of California, Irvine\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2017\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;month = \"6\"<br>\n}<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2017 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
