Rather than modeling articulation using a family of warped (rotated and\nforeshortened) templates, we use a mixture of small, non-oriented parts. We describe a general, flexible mixture model that\njointly captures spatial relations between part locations and co-occurrence relations between part mixtures, augmenting standard\npictorial structure models that encode just spatial relations. Our models have several notable properties: (1) they efficiently model\narticulation by sharing computation across similar warps (2) they efficiently model an exponentially-large set of global mixtures\nthrough composition of local mixtures and (3) they capture the dependency of global geometry on local appearance (parts\nlook different at different locations). When relations are tree-structured, our models can be efficiently optimized with dynamic\nprogramming. We learn all parameters, including local appearances, spatial relations, and co-occurrence relations (which encode\nlocal rigidity) with a structured SVM solver. Because our model is efficient enough to be used as a detector that searches over\nscales and image locations, we introduce novel criteria for evaluating pose estimation and human detection, both separately\nand jointly. We show that currently-used evaluation criteria may conflate these two issues. Most previous approaches model\nlimbs with rigid and articulated templates that are trained independently of each other, while we present an extensive diagnostic\nevaluation that suggests that flexible structure and joint training are crucial for strong performance. We present experimental\nresults on standard benchmarks that suggest our approach is the state-of-the-art system for pose estimation, improving past\nwork on the challenging Parse and Buffy datasets, while being orders of magnitude faster.\n\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"bibtext\">\n      <h3>Download: <a href=\"/papers/YangR_TPAMI_2013/YangR_TPAMI_2013.pdf\">pdf</a></h3>\n      <h3>Text Reference</h3>\nYi&nbsp;Yang and Deva Ramanan.\nArticulated pose estimation with flexible mixtures-of-parts.\n<em>IEEE TPAMI</em>, 2013.<br>\n<h3>BibTeX Reference</h3>\n@ARTICLE{YangR_TPAMI_2013,<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;author = \"Yang, Yi and Ramanan, Deva\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;title = \"Articulated pose estimation with flexible mixtures-of-parts\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;journal = \"IEEE TPAMI\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;year = \"2013\",<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tag = \"grouping\"<br>\n}<br>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div id=\"footer\">\n    <div>\n      <a href=\"/\">Computational Vision</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> |\n      <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"updated\">&copy; 2007-2017 UC Irvine</div>\n  </div>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
