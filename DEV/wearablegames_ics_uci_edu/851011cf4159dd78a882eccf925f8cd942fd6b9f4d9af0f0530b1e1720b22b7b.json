increase in commercial interest in wearable technologies, spearheaded by Google\u2019s Glass project and also by the success of a new generation of fitness oriented biosensors such as the Fitbit, the Bodymedia Fit, and the Misfit Shine.\u00a0 However, although there is a good deal of optimism and excitement about the future of wearable technology, the design space currently occupied by these new wearables is actually quite narrow.\u00a0 We would argue that this is in part due to a preoccupation with individual-focused, data-driven <em>function </em>of the wearable devices among technology designers, and \u2013 consequentially \u2013 a lack of attention to the ways in which these device shape the social interactions, emotional experiences and identities of wearers. Google Glass has received significant media attention, not just because it enables a new mode of interaction with computational devices, but also because it visibly alters the social identity of its user [e.g. 8].\u00a0 Wearable technologies are different than handheld technologies in part because of the ways in which clothing, costume, and fashion are used as expressive social\u00a0performances in the world.\u00a0 Incorporating an understanding of the expressive and social dimensions of wearability opens up new design possibilities for this technology.</p>\n<p>Concurrent with the rise in fitness and lifestyle focused wearables, in the last 10 years there has been a proliferation of embodied interfaces for digital games, including systems such as Nintendo\u2019s Wii, Sony\u2019s Move controller, and Microsoft\u2019s Kinect, as well as independent \u2018indie\u2019 experimentation with custom controllers.\u00a0 These devices afford a range of new playful experiences, in part by circumventing the entrenched literacies associated with the handheld video game controller \u2013 literacies that exclude many potential gamers who have not mastered the arcane feats of manual dexterity required by such interfaces.\u00a0 Embodied interfaces have opened up a whole new design space for games [e.g. 4, 7]. \u00a0It is evident that interfaces that reshape the body of the player in meaningful ways are capable of using the body as an expressive channel for narrative meaning [10]. Performing an avatar/player character physically and socially can increase the sense of identification and immersion the player feels, as well as heighten social engagement and involvement for both players and spectators [3]. There is a growing \u2018indie\u2019 movement that has increasingly taken up embodied interaction (e.g. Kaho Abe\u2019s games, [1], including the Costumes as Game Controllers project [2]). We draw upon this work in the proposed studio.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_52\" style=\"width: 261px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2469916,00.asp\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-52\" class=\"wp-image-52\" src=\"https://wearablegames.ics.uci.edu//wp-content/wearablegames/uploads/14155682003_d6c1053024_z.jpg\" alt=\"Some &quot;glasshole&quot;...\" width=\"251\" height=\"474\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-52\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Wearing Google Glass is an expressive act &#8211; it has come to signify participation in a value-laden discourse around technology, privacy, and wearability</p></div>\n<p>Taking inspiration from theatrical costuming and fashion design, we plan to host a studio that enables participants to create wearable game controllers that include costuming elements.\u00a0 In theatrical and dance practice, costumes and masks are frequently used to elicit specific character behaviors in performers.\u00a0 Improvisational theater theorist and Mask practitioner Keith Johnstone describes masks as a source of <em>outside-&gt;in </em>transformation [5]. Stanslavski, the father of Method acting, wrote about the power of masks and makeup to elicit powerful new experiences of the self [9].\u00a0 Schools of outside-&gt;in method acting have long held that it is possible to use external stimuli including costumes, choreography, and tangible props to elicit transformative experiences in a performer.</p>\n<p>Fashion aficionados similarly use the clothing they select to inhabit an identity and to project that identity in social contexts and interactions with others. What takes place in a bounded \u2018magic circle\u2019 of gameplay with costuming, we believe also has relevance outside this sphere and in the realm of everyday life. We can see the beginnings of the modulation of wearables into fashion with experiments like Google\u2019s collaboration with Diane von Furstenberg putting Glass on runway models [6]. The proposed studio will allow participants to reflect upon the transformation of wearables into fashion objects in their own right, toward anticipating and designing these aspects of such devices.</p>\n<p>The \u201cCostumes and Wearables as Game Controllers\u201d studio aims to explore how researchers within the tangible and embodied interaction community can expand the expressive possibilities inherent in wearables and embodied interfaces by applying inspiration from costuming and fashion design.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_54\" style=\"width: 470px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://kahoabe.net/?portfolio=hit-me\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-54\" class=\"wp-image-54 size-full\" src=\"https://wearablegames.ics.uci.edu//wp-content/wearablegames/uploads/HitMe.jpg\" alt=\"HitMe\" width=\"460\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://wearablegames.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/wearablegames/uploads/HitMe.jpg 460w, https://wearablegames.ics.uci.edu/wp-content/wearablegames/uploads/HitMe-300x195.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px\" /></a><p id=\"caption-attachment-54\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Games like Kaho Abe\u2019s Hit Me! make use of player postures and movements to explore social dynamics and create engaging spectacle.</p></div>\n<h1>Studio Proposal</h1>\n<p>In addition to providing an easy-to-use hardware prototyping platform, we will also provide a wide assortment of clothing, costume pieces, and accessories for participants to modify and transform into wearable game controllers.\u00a0 Participants will be invited to bring any costume or prop items that they would like to contribute to the shared group pool, so long as they understand that these items may well be modified and re-appropriated during the studio.We plan to assemble a simple kit for quickly hacking together wearable game controllers, so that participants can focus on the expressive possibilities of designing new wearable game interfaces.\u00a0 We propose a very simple hardware platform comprised of conductive fabric, alligator clips, and the MaKey MaKey interface board, which we will provide to teams of participants to facilitate rapid prototyping of wearable controllers.\u00a0 For more advanced and ambitious participants we will also provide an assortment of Arduinos, accelerometers, flex sensors, and other off the shelf sensors.\u00a0 Participants are encouraged to source and supply their own specialized hardware if they desire to work with any particularly esoteric sensors or devices.</p>\n<p>Prior to the start of the studio, the organizers will curate a selection of free-to-play online games that we believe will lend themselves to this type of expressive interface design.\u00a0 A list of these games will be provided to the participants prior to their arrival at the conference, to help them plan possible new interactions ahead of time, but participants are also encouraged to suggest and provide other games that they are interested in designing new interfaces for.</p>\n<p>Expected skills:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passing familiarity with games and embodied interaction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An understanding of basic electronics prototyping will be helpful, but is not required.</p>\n<p>Expected preparation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will expect participants to bring a laptop computer capable of connecting to a MaKey MaKey via USB and the internet via WiFi.</li>\n<li>Participants are expected to take the time to familiarize themselves with the provided list of games and with the basic workings of the MaKey MaKey ahead of time.</li>\n<li>Optionally, participants are encouraged to bring any hardware, software, tools, and prototyping supplies they wish to contribute, particularly if they have a specialized design idea that they wish to realize.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Studio Topics to be covered</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Embodied interaction and embodied game interfaces, characters and avatars.</li>\n<li>Basics of method acting and \u201coutside-&gt;in\u201d theatrical techniques.</li>\n<li>Cultural perspectives on clothing, fashion, and wearability.</li>\n<li>The importance of shaping <em>experience</em>, <em>identity, </em>and<em> sociality</em> in addition to <em>individual</em>&#8211;<em>focused</em> <em>function </em>when designing wearable interfaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We anticipate that exposing participants to these interdisciplinary perspectives will support ongoing explorations of meaningful wearable interface design, beyond the confines of the studio itself.</p>\n<h1>Studio Learning Goals</h1>\n<p>Our studio will broaden participants\u2019 perspective on design criteria and objectives for wearables and embodied interfaces, encouraging them to incorporate aesthetics, strategies, and values from costuming and fashion. The studio should provide valuable food for thought for participants interested in the future of the wearables and embodied interaction design space, shifting their approach to design values and process.</p>\n<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>\n<p>Thanks to Eyebeam gallery for support of the initial Costume as Game Controllers project in NYC.</p>\n<h1>References</h1>\n<p>[1] Abe, K.
