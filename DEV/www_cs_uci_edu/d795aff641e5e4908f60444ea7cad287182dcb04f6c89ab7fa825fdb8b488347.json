Yet\\, at the same time\\, the architectures\\, applications and services that fostered this new reality fundamentally altered the relationship between users and security and privacy. In this talk I map the scientific community\u2019s evolving efforts over the last decade in evaluating smart phone application security and privacy. I consider several key scientific questions and explore the methods and tools used to answer them. Through this exposition\\, I show how our joint understanding of adversary and industry practices have matured over time\\, and briefly consider how these results have informed and shaped technical public policy in the United States. I conclude with\\na discussion of the open problems and opportunities in mobile device security.How hard is it to program these systems today? How will we be programming these systems in the future? How will innovations in memory and storage devices present further opportunities and challenges? What is the impact of longterm software engineering cost on applications? In this talk\\, I will present some research opportunities and challenges that are brought about by this perfect storm. \\nBio: Patrick McDaniel is a Distinguished Professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Pennsylvania State University\\, Fellow of the IEEE and ACM\\, and Director of the Institute for Networking and Security Research. Professor McDaniel is also the program manager and lead scientist for the Army Research Laboratory\u2019s Cyber-Security Collaborative Research Alliance. Patrick\u2019s research focuses on a wide range of topics in computer and network security and technical public policy. Prior to joining Penn State in 2004\\, he was a senior research staff member at AT&T LabsResearch. \\nDownload PDF \\n\r\nURL:https://www.cs.uci.edu/event/patrick-mcdaniel/\r\nLOCATION:Donald Bren Hall\\, Irvine\\, CA\\, 92697\\, United States\r\nCATEGORIES:Distinguished Lecture Series\r\nATTACH;FMTTYPE=image/jpeg:https://www.cs.uci.edu/wp-content/cs/uploads/PatrickMcDaniel.jpg\r\nORGANIZER;CN=\"hbyrnes%40ics.uci.edu\":MAILTO:hbyrnes@ics.uci.edu\r\nEND:VEVENT\r\nEND:VCALENDAR", "encoding": "utf-8"}
