If we did have a clear sense\nof what threads would be discussed on which list, I think it would help,\nnot hinder, the goal of arriving at orthogonal protocols.\n\nIn any event, since there is no consensus on a suitable division, I\nalso agree that the lists ought to be combined.\n\n-Dave\n\nsorry, I can't resist: how about this division?\n\ndistributed authoring covers workspace issues:\n\t- retrieval of documents\n\t- changing them\n\t- lock mechanism\n\nversion control covers repository issues:\n\t- configuration of branches/tips\n\t- release/promotion of a version\n\t- lock policies\n\nAuthoring in the absence of versioning means that one may\nmanually set locks to control concurrency, and GETs retrieve\na resource, and PUTs replace it.\n\nAuthoring in the absence of version control, but with versioning,\nmeans that one may manually set locks to control concurrency,\nGETs (by default) retrieve the tip of a branch (but can retrieve\nprevious revisions), and PUTs result in a new tip revision along\nthat branch.\n\nAuthoring with version control means that one interacts with the\nCM system (acquiring these cookies we've been discussing) to\ndefine which branch one sees oneself (setting up the \"workspace\")\nand to define which branches others see (release/promotion).\nIn addition, the CM system may implicitly set and release locks\nto control concurrency, according to its policies.\n\nAuthoring with version control probably also implies that one's\ncurrent activities are visible in some way to oneself and\nothers.  \"what am I working on\", \"who has this URL locked,\nand what are they working on\", etc.\n\n(I hope that what I've stated here as \"branch/tip\" is equally\napplicable to change-set, etc. systems...)\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0149.html\">Roy T.
