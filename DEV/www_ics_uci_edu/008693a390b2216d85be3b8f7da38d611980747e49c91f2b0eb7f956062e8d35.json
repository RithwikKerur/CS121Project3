Such a requirements\n      analysis will allow the working group to quickly elminate\n      those proposed notations that clearly fail to satisfy the\n      requirements, and discuss the relative merits of the\n      (hopefully several) contenders left in the light of a\n      common framework.</p>\n    <p>The requirements listed in this document were condensed\n      from the discussions held on the\n      <a href=\"mailto:www-vers-wg@ics.UCI.EDU\">WWW Versioning\n        Working Group.</a></p>\n    <h1>Rationale</h1>\n    <p>Before starting in to the development of the requirements\n      of any notation for embedding version information in URLs,\n      the first question must be, \"Is there a requirement that we\n      be able to do so?\"  While the research group at NTT\n      expressed some concern at the group's assumption that such\n      a capability was necessary, the general concensus has been\n      that the ability to embed hypertextual links to historical\n      versions of documents is valuable.</p>\n    <p>Given that we want to be able to link to historical\n      revisions of a document, there are two routes open to us:\n      extend HTML to provide a way to store the information,\n      perhaps as a new attribute for the HTML <code>A</code> tag; or\n      embed such information in the URL itself.  While the former\n      method is conceptually more in keeping with the SGML way of\n      doing things, it does have the drawback that existing Web\n      clients will be unable to access the information in any\n      meaningful way.  Thus, we are limited to embedding version\n      control information in the HTTP URL itself.</p>\n    <h1>Requirements and Anti-Requirements</h1>\n    <p>As well as listing the requirements that any\n      notation must satisfy, it's useful to provide a list of\n      anti-requirements.  Anti-requirements describe\n      functionality that the notation is explicity not\n      required to support or, more strongly, is required to not\n      support.</p>\n    <dl>\n      <dt>The version information is opaque to the client.</dt>\n      <dd>Because the notation will be required to operate in the\n        version control environment prefered by the website\n        maintainer, it must be able to properly contain arbitrary\n        strings, which may be used by the VCS as version\n        identifiers.  While the version information will be\n        explicable to the human operator, and perhaps to\n        special-purpose clients, in the general case, we must\n        assume that the client treats the URL as a black box.</dd>\n      <dt>It is not necessary to be able to decompose a URL into\n        its consitutent resource URL and version identifier.</dt>\n      <dd>URLs have been defined as \"magic cookies\" that HTTP\n        servers use to identify resources.  Clients cannot, in\n        general, decode a URL to determine how a server would\n        interpret it.</dd>\n      <dt>Given a resource URL and a version identifier,\n        version-aware clients must be able to construct a URL.</dt>\n      <dd>While existing URLs cannot be decomposed, the ability\n        to construct a URL is essential for version-aware\n        clients.  This requirement parallels the ability of\n        clients to submit queries against a page.</dd>\n      <dt>Any new notation must not cause problems for existing\n        pages.</dt>\n      <dd>Roughly, this means that the notation cannot cause a\n        version-aware server to interpret a pre-existing URL in a\n        new way.  For example, stating that version\n        information is appended to a resource URL as a \"special\n        query\", using the \"?\" URL syntax, will cause problems for\n        existing forms that contain a \"version\" field.</dd>\n      <dt>The version notation is not a configuration notation.</dt>\n      <dd>The functionality provided by the basic version\n        notation allows for the specification of a given revision\n        of a single resource.  The ability to \"surf into the\n        past\", which requires the ability to retrieve the correct\n        revisions of <strong>all</strong> of the embedding images\n        and linked pages, may be (should be able to be?) built on\n        top of the versioning URL notation.</dd>\n    </dl>\n  </body>\n</html>\n<pre>\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0068.html\">David G.
