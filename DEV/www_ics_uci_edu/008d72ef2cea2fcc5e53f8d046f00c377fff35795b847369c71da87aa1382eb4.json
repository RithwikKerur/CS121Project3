These include new algorithms with\nimproved cache performance for longest common subsequence (LCS), edit\ndistance, gap (i.e., edit distance with gaps), and least weight\nsubsequence. We present a new cache-oblivious framework called the\nGaussian Elimination Paradigm (GEP) for Gaussian elimination without\npivoting that also gives cache-oblivious algorithms for Floyd-Warshall\nall-pairs shortest paths in graphs and 'simple DP', among other\nproblems.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
