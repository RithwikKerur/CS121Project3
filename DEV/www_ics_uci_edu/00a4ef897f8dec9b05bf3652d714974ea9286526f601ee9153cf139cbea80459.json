This course\nwill introduce the broad field of human-computer interaction (HCI):  the\npsychological underpinnings of cognition and perception; the variety of\ninteraction devices, media, and styles; methods for designing systems\nand evaluating their usability; and the principles and guidelines the field has developed.  The success of most systems today, especially\nconsumer products, depends largely on HCI decisions.</P>\n<P>\nThis course is also the prerequisite for Informatics 132, the project course in HCI requirements and evaluation. Also of note are Informatics 133, the course in HCI programming, Informatics 134, the HCI programming project course,  Informatics 143, on information visualization, and Informatics 153, on computer-supported cooperative work.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Prerequisite courses and concepts:</B>\n The prerequisite for Informatics 131 is one course in computing and upper division\nstanding. The course will not require any significant programming&mdash;that&#39;s\nfor Informatics 133&mdash;but we do expect each student to be able to write clear, cogent,\ngrammatical English at an upper division level because much of the work\nin this course will involve describing and justifying the design decisions\nand evaluation judgements you make.  We also expect you to have these basic\ncomputing skills:  Searching and browsing the Web, reading and sending Email,\ndownloading files, viewing and printing PDF (Adobe Acrobat) documents, and\ncreating or saving documents for Email and other purposes in plain ASCII\ntext form (not HTML or Word attachments). </P>\n<P>\n<B>Meeting place and times:</B>  Lecture meets\nTuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 to 3:50 p.m. in Engineering Tower 202. <!-- The originally listed discussion and lab sections will not meet.--></P>\n<P>The projection screen and audio of each class will be recorded and available through UCI Replay; after each class, you will receive electronic mail with the link for access. We must note, however, that this process is not 100% reliable; some classes may end up not being recorded. Moreover, in some classes we will be designing and critiquing our designs; being present to participate in those activities is an important part of the learning and counts towards the participation portion of your course grade.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Office hours:</B>  \n<!-- I will be in or near\nmy office during these scheduled times, during which course-related matters\nwill have first priority: \n-->I will plan to be available to discuss course-related matters right after class on Tuesdays and Thursdays.   <!-- Of course emergencies may come\nup, but I will try to give advance notice of any change.  If I&#39;m not\nimmersed in something else, I&#39;ll be glad to answer short questions whenever\nI&#39;m in my office, so feel free to drop by any time.m-->    The TA\nwill have scheduled hours as needed at a time and place to be announced. We&#39;ll also be\nhappy to make appointments for other times during the week.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can\nusually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours\n(perhaps a bit longer on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to the\naddress <code><A HREF=\"mailto:i131@uci.edu\">i131@uci.edu</A></code>. We will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam fiters snag a legitimate message. Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet Email address will help your messages get noticed.</P>\n<p>Email you send to <code><A HREF=\"mailto:i131@uci.edu\">i131@uci.edu</A></code> is private between you, the TA, the reader, and me. We have also set up a more public discussion forum at <code>www.piazza.com</code>. Piazza has some advantages over the typical noteboard or discussion group; we'll use it this term and analyze its usability, too.</P>\n<P>\nWe may also send course announcements by Email\nto the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.\n Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar\nhas for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your Email on another\naccount, you should set your UCInet account to forward your Email to your\npreferred account (you can do this on the web at <code><A HREF=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html\">http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html</A></code>).\n Don&#39;t let this slide; if you miss official announcements, your grade\ncould suffer.</P>\n\nThis course has a home page at <code><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/131/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/131/</A></code>; an archive of official course Email is available on your MyEEE page.\n<P>\n  <B>Textbook and course materials:</B>  \n  <BR>\n<I>Interaction Design:  Beyond Human-Computer Interaction,</I> fourth edition, by Jennifer\nPreece, Yvonne Rogers, and Helen Sharp. The third edition is okay, too. The <a href=\"http://www.id-book.com/buybook.php\">publisher's site</a> contains purchasing options, including a <a href=\"http://www.coursesmart.com/9781119020752\">rental e-book</a> at a reduced price.</P>\n<P>\n<I>The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint: Pitching Out Corrupts Within, </I>second edition, by \nEdward R. Tufte. This short monograph takes a critical look at the use of\nPowerPoint, a pervasive means of presenting information. <em>(This document and the following one are available on Amazon for $7 each; we'll be using them in the second half of the course.)</em></P>\n<P>\n<I>Visual &amp; Statistical Thinking: Displays\nof Evidence for Decision Making, </I>by Edward R. Tufte.  This reprint of\nChapter 2 of Tufte&#39;s book, <I>Visual Explanations,</I> describes two\nsituations where the way information was presented had life-or-death consequences.</P>\n<P>\n<I><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/12/10/071210fa_fact_gawande\">Annals of Medicine: The Checklist</a>, </I>by Atul Gawande (<em>The New Yorker</em>, December 10, 2007). A broad, practical discussion of how people can better cope with complex systems (in this case, surgery).</P>\n<P>\n<B>Course structure:\n<BR>\n</B><I><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/131/hw/index.html\">Assignments</A></I>\n(40% of the course grade, with later assignments generally weighted more\nheavily than earlier ones)\n<BR>\n<I>Class participation</I> (15%).  This mostly involves being present in class so you can take part in the in-class design and evaluation activities.\nPlan to attend every class meeting. <BR>\n<I>One midterm,</I> given in class on Thursday, August 20 (15%)\n<BR>\n<I>One final exam,</I> on Tuesday, September 8, from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. (30%)</P>\n<P>We determine final grades neither on a formal curve (with equal numbers of As and Fs, Bs and Ds, and so on) nor on a straight, fixed scale.\n  <!-- Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated, but in the past the actual cutoffs have often been lower; this means that you should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale indicates. If you're concerned, check with your TA or the instructor. The basic scale is: grades in the A range (A-, A, and in exceptional cases, A+), 90% and above; grades in the B range, 80%\u201390%; grades in the C range, 70%\u201380%. -->\nGrades below C are rare in this course; they result mostly from not completing assignments or otherwise not being engaged with the course. We recommend that you focus not on letter grades but on learning what's necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</P>\n<P>\nWe&#39;re required to say that in unusual\ncircumstances, these criteria could change, but we do not expect that to\nhappen.</P>\n<P><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the instructor at any time. </P>\n<P><B>What you must do right now to get started\n  in Informatics 131:\n  <BR>\n  </B>&mdash; If you do not have a UCInet ID,\n  get one.  See <code><A HREF=\"http://activate.uci.edu/\">http://activate.uci.edu/</A></code>.\n  <BR>\n  &mdash; If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your\n  UCInet account, redirect your mail at <code><A HREF=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html\">http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html</A></code>.<BR>\n  &mdash; Complete the <a href=\"http://eee.uci.edu/survey/infx131summer2015\">Informatics 131 Questionnaire</a> at http://eee.uci.edu/survey/infx131summer2015 (by 5:00 on Friday, August 7).<br>\n  &mdash; Go to <a href=\"http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/\">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a>, log in with your UCInet ID, choose &quot;Course Listing&quot; and &quot;Summer II 2015,&quot; click &quot;Go&quot; next to Informatics 131, and then click &quot;List me for this course.&quot; You'll submit most of your work electronically; this step is necessary to set that up.\n  <br>\n  &mdash; Sign yourself up for <a href=\"https://piazza.com/uci/summer2015/informatics131\">Informatics 131 on Piazza.com</a>.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Good advice and helpful hints:</B></P>\n<P>\nCheck your electronic mail regularly; this\nis an official channel for course announcements. When sending course-related mail, start the subject line with &quot;Infx 131&quot; or &quot;HCI class&quot;.</P>\n<P>\nAttendance in class is essential; concepts\nand issues that come up in class will find their way onto the exams and\nclass participation in various forms counts towards the  course grade. Note that missing a day of class in the summer session is like missing a whole week in the regular year. We will only take attendance occasionally; if you're not present one of those times, it counts for a lot.</P>\n<P>\nAlways keep your own copy of each assignment,\nboth electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\nshuffle (or if a file server should crash, which has happened\nin the past), we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.</P>\n<P>\nIf you find yourself having trouble or getting\nbehind, speak with the instructor.  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut\nof copying someone else&#39;s work and turning it in; the consequences can\nbe far worse than just a low score on one assignment.
