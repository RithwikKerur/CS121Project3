On entering ICS 1c I did not have a clue about what \nhypertext was. <A HREF= \"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Terms.html\"> \nHypertext</A>,I have learned, is the way that normal people are \nallowed to use computers.  What I mean by that is hypertext covers up all \nthe messy computer commands that most people do not understand (like me \nbefore I took this course).  Now when someone wants to write something on \nthe computer, one needs to use all those messy commands (plain text).  When \npeople see\nwhat you have written they are looking at it in HTML (hypertext markup \nlanguage)i.e., the pretty,clean stuff that we all see on Mosaic and the \nInternet.  Now a <A HREF= \n\"http://www.ziff.com/~eamonn/crash_course.html#links\"> \nlink</A> is \nmerely how one makes those blue words that you \nclick on that can send you from one document to another document.

Curious about the weather in <A HREF= \n\"http://thunder.met.fsu.edu/~nws/flwx.html\">Florida</A>?  At this site you may view the \nentire state of Florida and then click on hi-lited cities for a current weather \nreport.  For weather all over the world all you need to do is hop onto the <A HREF= \n\"http://thunder.met.fsu.edu/nws/public_html/wxhwy.html\"> Weather \nInformation Superhighway</A> and choose just about anywhere in the world.  Some sites \ninclude colorful satellite maps.  You can then see for yourself how the weather system \nis acting and possibly predict your own weather forecast. My <A HREF= \n\"http://zebu.uoregon.edu/weather.html\">favorite</A> so far is \nthe local Oregon weather reports.  Here you can hit the second `this' by local forecast\nand link into the University of Michigan's Weather Underground and receive information \nabout many different cities in the U.S.  Happy weathering!   <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>Do you like to ski?</H2></A>Skiing happens to be \none of my most favorite things to do in the whole world.  When I found \nthe<A HREF=\"http://diamond.sierra.net:80/SkiWeb/\">SKIWEB</A> I was pretty \nexcited.  Now I can look up current \nweather conditions if I'm planning a trip.  I can also get current road \nconditions and lodging information.  From the Rocky Mountains to \nEurope, it's all covered right here.  One of my favorite spots to visit \nin the Web World is<A \nHREF=\"http://www.adfa.oz.au/aais/Maps/AUS.html\">Australia</A> \nbecause I have not yet had a chance to visit there in the real world. \nThey have a great map with satellite pictures and the works.  Just give \nit a couple of minutes to download.  \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>Learn about a special study in Cognitive \nScience..</H2></A> I have discovered that I can learn about what my \nprofessors are researching while they are here at U.C. Irvine.  One \ninteresting study that you can discover for<A HREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/projects/civs/civs.html\"> yourself</A> is \nby my \nExperimental Psychology profesor, Professor D'Zmura. You can <A HREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/dzmura/dzmura.html\">`meet'</A>\nhim and all the other members of the U.C. Irvine Social Science <A HREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/faculty.html\">faculty</A> \nand find out about the research of other professors.  His main research \nemphasis is in color and visual comprehension of color.  This has a lot \nto do with understanding colorblindness. So...if everyone is telling you \nthat your clothes never match when you think they do, D'Zmura's the man for \nyou. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>Information about becoming an undergraduate in \nthe school of Social Sciences at U.C.I.</H2></A> Entering U.C. Irvine as a \nfreshman was difficult. What made it even harder was the fact that I knew \nvery little about my major.  On the web one can find important \ninformation that introduces the new student or just an inquisitive one \nto the department of<A HREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/umsocsci/umsocsci.html\">Social Sciences at \nU.C.I.</A>As we have previously seen you can even meet the members of the \nfaculty and communicate with them through<A \nHREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/faculty.html\"> e-mail</A>. Pick a professor \nin an area that looks interesting and send them some mail. Professors are \nhuman, too, they love mail.  \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a> </UL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted January 30, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
