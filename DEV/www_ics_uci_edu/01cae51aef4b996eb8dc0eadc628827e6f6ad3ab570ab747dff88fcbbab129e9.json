Thus, the reconstruction of a three-dimensional set of\npoints using information about its inter-point distances has become\na task of basic importance in determining molecular structure. But\nthe measurements are error-prone and some of the entries of the\nmesured distance matrix are arbitrarity \"corrupted.\" \n\n<p>In this paper, the authors present an algorithm which runs in\nO(<i>n</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) time, where <i>n</i> is the\nnumber of points, and that algorithm can reconstruct the model of\npoints <i>P</i> from its distance matrix, which has many errors and\nwhich is also not complete. The algorithm will produce a constant\nnumber of point sets consistent to a given distance matrix <i>\nM</i>, and one of them will be the correct point set <i>P</i>.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on a STOC '96 paper by <a href= \n\"http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~bab/\">Bonnie Berger</a>, <a href= \n\"http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/kleinber.html\">Jon\nKleinberg</a>, and <a href=\"http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~ftl/\">Tom\nLeighton</a>.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
