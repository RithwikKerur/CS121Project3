The 1D\nRMQ problem has been studied intensively because of\nits relevance to the Nearest Common Ancestor problem\nand its important use in stringology. If constant-time\nquery answering is required, linear time and space\npreprocessing algorithms were known for the 1D case,\nbut not for the higher dimensional cases. In this paper,\nwe give the first linear-time preprocessing algorithm\nfor arrays with fixed dimension, such that any range\nminimum query can be answered in constant time.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
