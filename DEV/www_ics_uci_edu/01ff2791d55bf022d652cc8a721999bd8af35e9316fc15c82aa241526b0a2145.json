I didn't do any New York research to speak of.  That was\r\nEstelle's contribution.  You can deduce which records she saw by the\r\ninformation she collected for the H branches.

I was happy to see both\r\nfamiliar and new names on the tree, particularly my great-grandfather's; as\r\nI'd mentioned, neither my father nor his sister was aware of it.  My parents\r\nalso recall some names of relatives that don't seem to fit in anywhere--\r\nwhen I get some time (or 'if', the way things have been going), I will try\r\nto trace them down and figure it out.  I hope that you are doing well and\r\nhaven't been hit too hard by the weather...  Moi, I just began a fresh batch\r\nof classes and got a new job working in a lab, so I've been keeping quite\r\nbusy, but I'm enjoying it.  Anyway, I will keep you posted if I find\r\nanything new about the maverick cousins.

I did not develop the H section.  Estelle Guzik did.  She researched\r\nvarious New York sources....wills, court records, naturalizations, birth, marriage\r\nand death.  Gradually, she fed Michael Cohen or me the information that she\r\ngathered.  It was placed on the computer by Michael.  Sometimes Estelle was able to\r\nmake connections by piecing things together when she got to a cemetery and found\r\npeople buried next to each other.  Sometimes the records themselves revealed family\r\nconnections.  Sometimes they didn't.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they didn't make the connections, Estelle didn't go beyond what she knew from\r\nrecords.  In a very few cases, we were able to find living people connected to a\r\ntree and went from there to gather more information.  In the years preceding and\r\nfollowing the book's publication, I developed inforamtion from Galician records,\r\nboth from mail and on the ground during my visit there.  Estelle was with me and\r\nshe participated in this collection process. We had no idea how people were related\r\nto the main tree....or if.  We merely went on the basis of the Langsam name.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the book came out, I wrote to a couple of places in New York and gathered\r\nsome 1915 and 1925 New York census records that supplemented some 1880, 1900 and\r\n1920 Federal census records.  The resulting information didn't help much.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the book was published, a small number of H families got hold of me or Michael\r\nor Yedidyah and provided some additional information.  Daniel's family continues to\r\nsurface from time to time with scraps of information but those who really knew\r\nanything are all gone now and I think we are at the end of the trail there.   Even\r\nDaniel's parents knew less than was in the book!\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the process of finding additional information will almost certainly have\r\nto come from people who are alive.  There simply are no records for any of the\r\ntowns where family lived.  New York and other US records may be able to help us\r\nmake connections but I'm convinced that we will learn very little of value.  I'm\r\nnot impressed with the knowledge of any of the people you contacted the other year\r\nthrough the internet.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the main body of the family is pretty well finished.  There are issues\r\nto be resolved with respect to L2 and L4.  I think that this is where we should put\r\nour energies but of course, Yedidyah is still not thrilled with confronting the\r\nissue and I don't see how the book can move forward with so little.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no ...repeat...no evidence that any of the H fragments are related to the\r\nmain body of the tree...we have no one aware of their connection to Pesach or the\r\nSpiras.  We have nothing except the Langsam name and some hazy beliefs that we must\r\nbe related because of the name.  I've spent a lot of hours poring over the H\r\nsections instead of focusing on my own branch and I'm wondering why I've done\r\nthat.   I need to rethink my priorities with respect to the tree and the overall\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to H9:  the family involving Esther Jacobs has never been cooperative in\r\nproviding information or responding to letters.  I don't know how it was concluded\r\nthat Isaac was involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuzan\r\n\r\n\r\n\"moishe@langsam.com\" wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n> ...to think of over the weekend.

I know you are just responding to what 's coming into you\r\nand you are trying to be helpful to people.  I can't tell you how\r\nirritating it is for me this many years later to have to go over all\r\nthis old ground.  But I will try.\r\n\r\n\r\nH 1 and H9 are probably closely related.  Either Isaac and Mendel were\r\nbrothers or otherwise closely related.  They lived very close together\r\nat some point. There is much to suggest that they are related.  A number\r\nof years ago,  Ruby Jacobs called me to say that she had seen the book\r\nsomewhere.  She wanted to tell me that we had forgotten Isaac and\r\nGittel's (H9) daughter Esther who married a man named Jacobs.  She\r\ncouldn't remember her father in law's first name (?????Excuse me???).\r\nRuby's husband was Esther's son, Irving.  Irving was said to be named\r\nafter his grandfather, Isaac.  He was deceased.  She gave me a phone\r\nnumber but when I tried it at a later point, it was no longer good.  She\r\nhad some additional information about David's son, Sidney.  Sidney's\r\nwife was named Pauline.  She also said that Sarah had married a Blasberg\r\nand they had two sons:  Sylvan and Harold.  I had addresses but neither\r\nanswered a letter.  I had Harold Blasberg's phone number in Valley\r\nStream but I doubt that I ever called him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSidney, by the way, was still living in 1999:  80 E. Hartsdale,\r\nHartsdale, NY 10530.  914 761-1689.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have Phillip Langsam's Brooklyn death certificate which gives his\r\nparents as David L. and Rose nee Freudenfall.  The information came from\r\nNathan, brother and the burial is at New Montefiore in Pinelawn.  Issac\r\nand Gittel were in the census with some children in 1900.  See the page\r\nin the book. I know that Estelle found all sorts of wills and\r\nnaturallization records about members of this family.  I found a record\r\nabout Abraham's son, Paul, who was the subject of an ugly court case as\r\nhis parents were divorcing. In that record, it was revealed that he was\r\nretarded.  And then, I found a note about his death.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning to H1:  it is possible that Esther Jacob was on Mendel's tree,\r\nnot on Isaac's.  Ruby Jacobs didn't know anything except that her\r\nhusband had been related to all of these fancy doctors and lawyers.  She\r\nwas the one who told me that Irving was related to them and I accepted\r\nher information at face value.\r\n\r\n\r\nH1 folks know next to nothing about their family history.  And, by the\r\nway, could care less.  I've been in touch with many people from H1 over\r\nthe years.  But, there is no Yeshaya that I know of in their family\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to Yeshaya:  Just because a man's name was Isaac as his street name\r\nin New York doesn't mean his Hebrew name was not Yeshaya.  Isaac Yeshaya\r\neven.  But for sure the father in H9 was in the 1900 census as Isaac.\r\nAnd in the records of his children as they died.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many Shaye's in the Langsam family.  The question is where\r\ndoes he fit with the people whom you have knocking at your door.  Make\r\nthem work a little....like documenting their own family history.  Don't\r\nassume that we have information about them.  There are many Langsams\r\nabout whom we have nothing.  They may not be IN THE BOOK!\r\n\r\n\r\nSuzan\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nDate: Tue, 13 Jun 2000 13:20:14 -0400 (EDT) \r\nFrom: melissa rose langsam <langsam@fas.harvard.edu> \r\nTo: Undisclosed recipients: ; \r\nSubject: onto the next adventure! \r\n\r\n\r\ndear wonderful people,\r\n\r\n\r\nthank you for making the last four years so memorable. please keep in\r\ntouch, wherever your travels take you!\r\n\r\n\r\ni will be in cambridge, mass. for another few days before heading home to\r\nnew york to pack up for the next leg of the journey, namely austin,\r\ntexas. i'll be working in the press office for the bush presidential\r\ncampaign for the next few months. \r\n\r\n\r\nafter that, i expect to be in israel -- at hebrew u, studying hebrew lit\r\nand trying to transform my thesis into a publishable book (keep your\r\nfingers crossed for me!)\r\n\r\n\r\nif you plan to be in either austin or jerusalem, be sure to let me know!\r\n\r\n\r\ni do not yet have an address and phone number to pass along, but i can be\r\nreached at mrlangsam@yahoo.com, and i have registered for \r\nlangsam@post.harvard.edu, which should forward my messages forever more.\r\n\r\n\r\nwishing everyone a relaxing summer and a super next year!\r\n\r\n\r\nmL\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ***************************************\r\n                       \"I need to laugh\r\n                        And when the sun is out\r\n                        I've got something I can laugh about.\"\r\n                        -- The Beatles, \"Good Day Sunshine\"\r\n                           \r\n_________________________________________________________________________________\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nOn the internet are the pages from:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n                        DORENE (KIMBERLY) DOYLE\r\n                           6174 LAWRENCE ROAD\r\n                          LANTANA, FL 33462-2140\r\n                                United States\r\n                               g8rtj@aol.com \r\n                               Report Section:\r\n\r\n                          Dorene Doyle - InterneTree\r\n      User Home Page Genealogy Report: Descendants of Soloman Goodson Doyle\r\n</pre>\r\nThe home page is at:<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/d/o/y/Dorene-Doyle/index.html\">http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/d/o/y/Dorene-Doyle/index.html</a>\r\n<br>and the portion dealing with the offspring of Nathan, son of David and Rose is at:\r\n<br><a href=\"http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/d/o/y/Dorene-Doyle/GENE11-0005.html#CHILD21\">http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/d/o/y/Dorene-Doyle/GENE11-0005.html#CHILD21</a>\r\n<p><br>\r\nThis is an excerpt:<br>\r\n<BR>\r\n<FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3><B>21.</B><A NAME=\"CHILD21\"></A>  A</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=2>NNETTE</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>5</FONT></SUP> K</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=2>WESTEL</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3><I> (</I><I>A</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=2><I>BRAHAM</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3> <I>S</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=2><I>HRAGA</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>4</FONT></SUP><I>, </I><I>I</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=2><I>SAAC</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>3</FONT></SUP><I>, </I><I>I</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=2><I>SRAEL</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>2</FONT></SUP><I>, </I><I>Y</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=2><I>EHUDA</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3> <I>L</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=2><I>EIB</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=3><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>1</FONT></SUP><I>)</I><A HREF=\"http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/d/o/y/Dorene-Doyle/GENE11-0013.html#ENDNOTE17\"><I><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>17</FONT></SUP></I></A> was born 1909 in Brooklyn, NY<A HREF=\"http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/d/o/y/Dorene-Doyle/GENE11-0013.html#ENDNOTE17\"><I><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>17</FONT></SUP></I></A>, and died March 01, 1997<A HREF=\"http://www.familytreemaker.com/users/d/o/y/Dorene-Doyle/GENE11-0013.html#ENDNOTE17\"><I><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>17</FONT></SUP></I></A>.
