On the other hand, any two \r\n\tparties who <EM>are</EM>\r\nmembers of the same group will recognize each other as members. Thus, a secret \r\nhandshake protocol can be used in any scenario where group members need to \r\nidentify each other without revealing their group affiliations to outsiders.\r\n<p>\r\n\tThe work of&nbsp;[BDSS+03] constructed secret handshakes secure under the&nbsp;<EM>Bilinear \r\n\t\tDiffie-Hellman</EM> (BDH) assumption in the Random Oracle Model (ROM). We \r\n\tshow how to build secret handshake protocols secure under a more standard \r\n\tcryptographic assumption of&nbsp;<EM>Computational Diffie Hellman</EM> (CDH), \r\n\tusing a novel tool of&nbsp;<EM>CA-oblivious</EM> public key encryption, which \r\n\tis an encryption scheme s.t. neither the public key nor the ciphertext reveal \r\n\tany information about the Certification Authority (CA) which certified the \r\n\tpublic key. We construct such CA-oblivious encryption, and hence a handshake \r\n\tscheme, based on CDH (in ROM). The new scheme takes 3 communication rounds like \r\n\tthe BDH-based scheme, but it is about twice cheaper computationally, and it \r\n\trelies on a weaker computational assumption.</p>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
