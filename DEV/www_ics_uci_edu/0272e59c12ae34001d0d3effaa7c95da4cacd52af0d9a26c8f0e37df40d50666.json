WebRTC fills a critical gap in web technologies by allowing (a) browser access to native devices (e.g., microphone, webcam) through a Javascript API and (b) sharing captured streams using  Real-Time browser-to-browser Communication. WebRTC also provides data sharing. \n</p>\n<p>\nWebRTC accomplishes three main tasks: Acquiring audio and video; Communicating Audio and Video; Communicating Arbitrary Data.\nThese tasks map one to one to three main Javascript APIs: MeadiaStream (i.e., getUserMedia); RTCPeerConnection; RTCDataChannel.\nVarious aspects of video, audio and data transmission can be evaluated once a connection is established.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are investigating issues in WebRTC behavior and performance. The latter is particularly important on mobile devices.\nWe have developed a benchmark suite, WebRTCBench, to help identify perfromance issues and target them for improvement.\nThe goal of WebRTCBench is to measure various aspects of connection establishment and streaming between WebRTC peers. \nThis allows a quantitative comparison of WebRTC implementations across browsers and devices (i.e., hardware platforms).\nWebRTCBench allows definition and evaluation of MediaStreams composed of Video, Audio, Data or any subset of the three.\nIt can establish a single peer connection with a media server and multiple peer connections between browsers in a WebRTC triangle. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe current version of the benchmark can be downloded \n<A HREF=\"https://github.com/INTCUCI/WebRTCBench\">here</A>\n</p>\n<p>\nSupported by the Intel Corp.\n</p>\n\n\n</body> </HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
