Conjecture on \"FG#s\":\n&gt; Non Compes Mentes!\n&gt; We return you to your regular channel.\n\n     This is a nice question, if we interpret \"simplest\" as\n\"nicest\".  Let's ask for one whose group contains the icosahedral\nrotation group.  Then unless the center of a face is at one\nend of an axis of symmetry, that face is one of an orbit of size 60.\nIf it IS, the face is one of an orbit of size  12,20, or 30,  but\nwe can have at most one each of these.  This gives 8 residue-classes\nmodulo 60, namely\n\n   60N +  0, 12, 20, 30, 32, 42, 50, 62\n\nfor icosahedrally symmetric N-hedra - note that 100 isn't in any of these.\n\n     If we took the rotational cube group, we'd get\n\n   24N + 0, 6, 8, 12, 14, 18, 20, 26\n\nand again 100 isn't present.\n\n    The rotational tetrahedral group gives\n\n   12N + 0, 4, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 14\n\nand here we can get 100, but only as 12N + 4  for  N = 8.\n\n     Here's a hecatohedron with full tetrahedral symmetry:\n\nForm the \"16-reticulated cube\", by dividing each face of a\ncube into 18 smaller \"square\" faces in the obvious way,\ngiving a 96-hedron.  Then tetrahedrally truncate this.\n\nI suppose I'd call it the\n\n     \"semi-trivalently-truncated 16-reticulated cube\" !\n\n    Otherwise, the group of rotational symmetries is\ncyclic or dihedral, and it follows that at most 2\nfaces can be fixed by a subgroup of size more than 2 (of\nANY symmetries, rotational or not).\n\n   If the full group has order N, it must have an orbit of\nsize at least N/2,  whence  N/2 is at most 100, and N at most 200.\n\nA bit of thought shows that the only two possibilities with a group\nof order 200 are the pentacontagonal bipyramid and antibipyramid.\n\n    John Conway \n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
