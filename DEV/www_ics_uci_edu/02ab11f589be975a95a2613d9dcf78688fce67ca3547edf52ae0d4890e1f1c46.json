If so, you \nshould then determine the slope of that line,\nso as to provide experimental evidence for estimating W(A) as a function\nof n, and you should give that function in your report, for each\nalgorithm, A.\n\n<p>\n<b>Note:</b> There will be 10 points of extra credit available to each student\nwho implements the first-fit and best-fit solutions that run \nin O(n log n) time, that is, the solutions that use a balanced binary search\ntree.  You do not need to implement a balance binary search tree \"from\nscratch,\" but you do need to either implement your own solution or\nadapt a library-based search tree so as to perform the types of\nqueries and updates necessary for the faster versions of first-fit and\nbest-fit.\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
