If you know of\na proof, you'll either get a sincere acknowledgement in a resulting\npaper, or perhaps even be asked if you want to be a co-author of\nthe resulting paper.\n\n(Before you get too excited about this possibility, or spend too much\ntime on this conjecture, my colleagues and I are also trying to find a\nproof for a conjecture that would supersede this result, and if we find\nit, this proof may never see the pages of a journal.)\n\nConjecture\n----------\n\nYou are given 6 arbitrary points in the euclidean plane.\n\n    Technical detail: The conjecture allows more than one of the points\n    to be at the same location.  Assume that the points are identified by\n    some names other than their coordinates, so that two points that happen\n    to be at the same place are still considered different points.\n\nFind a maximum matching for these 6 points,\n\n    Defn: A matching on a set of n points is a set of n/2 pairs of points,\n    such that no two pairs contain a common point.  The length of a single\n    pair is equal to the Euclidean distance between the points of the pair.\n    The length of a matching is the sum of all n/2 pair lengths.  I only\n    care about matchings with the maximum length among all possible\n    matchings.\n\nLet the matching be {{a_1, b_1}, {a_2, b_2}, {a_3, b_3}}.\n\nProve that there must exist a point x such that for all i, 1 <U>&lt;</U> i <U>&lt;</U> 3,\n\ndist(a_i, x) + dist(x, b_i) <U>&lt;</U> 2/sqrt(3) * dist(a_i, b_i)\n\nwhere dist(x, y) is the Euclidean distance between x and y.\n\nWhy do I care?\n--------------\n\nOne interesting consequence is that if such a point exists for any 6 points\nin the plane, then it also must exist for _any_ even number points in the\nplane.\n\nTo see this, note that one way to interpret the statement:\n\ndist(a_i, x) + dist(x, b_i) <U>&lt;</U> 2/sqrt(3) * dist(a_i, b_i)\n\nis to note that the set of all such points x lie inside an ellipse\nwith foci a_i and b_i.  If we denote this set of points by\nell(a_i, b_i, 2/sqrt(3)), then the conjecture says that the three\nell sets must have a common point.\n\nIf this were true, then we could prove the conjecture for any even\nnumber of points by applying Helly's Theorem, described below.\n\nHelly's Theorem\n---------------\n\n(Sorry, I don't have a reference, and I don't even know if I spelled\nHelly correctly.  I've heard that Helly was Hungarian, and he proved\nthis theorem while he was jailed during World War II.  If you are\ninterested in a citation, let me know and I'll ask the person I heard\nit from.)\n\nGiven any collection of convex sets in R^2, if all sub-collections\nof exactly 3 of these sets have a common point, then all n sets have\na common point.\n\nI've also heard that this generalizes if you replace R^2 with R^k, and\n3 with (k+1).  Pretty neat, I thought.\n\nWhere did 2/sqrt(3) come from?\n------------------------------\n\nI know that the conjecture is false if 2/sqrt(3) is replaced with\nanything smaller.  To see this, choose the six points such that two\nof them are at each of the vertices of an equilateral triangle.  Then\nthe only point x that satisfies the conjecture is the center of the\ntriangle.\n\nThe conjecture may be false for 2/sqrt(3).  If you know of a\ncounterexample, please let me know.  In general, I'd like to prove the\nconjecture for as small a constant (in place of 2/sqrt(3)) as possible.\n\nWhy do I care about proving this?\n---------------------------------\n\nThe following is just a quick summary.  If you want more details,\njust ask and I'll spend more time writing up details.\n\nIt relates to an abstract version of a problem in designing communication\nnetworks.  The given points represent nodes that should be connected\nby a network.  The length of a maximum matching is a lower bound on\nthe cost of any feasible network, and the point x is a place where I'd\nlike to place the center of a \"star\" network, in which all given points\nare connected directly to the star.\n\nIf the conjecture is true, I can show that a star network costs at most\n2/sqrt(3) times more than an optimal solution.\n\nHave I made any progress myself, before asking the net?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nOnly a little.\n\nThink of the matching of the 6 points as a set of 3 line segments.\nEach line segment joins one of the pairs of points.\n\nIf every pair of line segments intersects at a single point,\nthen consider the triangle with these three intersecting points as its\nvertices.  For any triangle, there exists a point x in its interior\nor its boundary such that each side of the triangle subtends an angle\nof at least 120 degrees from x.  If a line segment AB subtends an angle\nof at least 120 degrees from x, then\n\ndist(A,x) + dist(x,B) <U>&lt;</U> dist(A,B)\n\nTherefore x satisfies the conjecture.\n\nSomeone else working on this conjecture tried breaking it up into cases\nbased on the number of intersections between the 3 line segments.\nThe above shows that if there are 3 intersections, the conjecture holds.\nThe cases for 0, 1, or 2 intersections are still eluding me.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this.\n\nAndy Fingerhut\nApplied Research Laboratory                     &lt;-- this line is optional if\nWashington University, Campus Box 1045/Bryan 509      you have limited space\nOne Brookings Drive\nSaint Louis, MO 63130-4899\n \nTel: 314-935-6110\nFax: 314-935-7302\nInternet: <A HREF=\"mailto:jaf@arl.wustl.edu\">jaf@arl.wustl.edu</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:jaf@siesta.cs.wustl.edu\">jaf@siesta.cs.wustl.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        A conjecture about 6 points in the Euclidean plane\n<B>Date:</B>           Mon, 18 Sep 1995 15:14:17 -0700\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nHi --\nYou sent out this message a couple months ago,\ndid you get any response?\n\n    You are given 6 arbitrary points in the euclidean plane.\n    Find a maximum matching for these 6 points,\n    Let the matching be {{a_1, b_1}, {a_2, b_2}, {a_3, b_3}}.\n    Prove that there must exist a point x such that for all i, 1 <U>&lt;</U> i <U>&lt;</U> 3,\n    dist(a_i, x) + dist(x, b_i) <U>&lt;</U> 2/sqrt(3) * dist(a_i, b_i)\n\nI think I can prove it with a worse constant,\nand directly for any number of points (rather than applying Helly).\nAlso it seems to work for bichromatic point sets as well:\n\nlet (a1,b1) be shortest edge in the matching, and let x\nbe any point on that edge.\nThen if d(ai,x)+d(bi,x) &gt; 3 d(ai,bi)\nyou could replace (a1,b1)&amp;(ai,bi) by (a1,bi)&amp;(ai,b1)\nwhich have total weight (by triangle inequality)\n\t&gt; 3d(ai,bi)-d(a1,b1) &gt; d(a1,b1)+d(ai,bi).\n\nTherefore your result seems to hold with 3 instead of 2/sqrt 3.  With a\nlittle more care this can be improved (for the monochromatic case only):\nif you take x to be the midpoint of (a1,b1), then one of a1,b1 is always\nfarther from ai or bi than x, so you only need to apply the triangle\ninequality on one of the two replacement edges and you get a factor of 2.5.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
