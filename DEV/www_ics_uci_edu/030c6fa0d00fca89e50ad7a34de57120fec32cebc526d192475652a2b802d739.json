In order to use it, you\r\nfirst have to activate your UCInetID if you haven't already. UCI\r\nprovides all its students with basic computing, including electronic\r\nmail and other Internet services, via a \"UCInetID\" computer account.\r\nInstructions for activating this account are available from several\r\nsources, but perhaps the easiest way is to activate your account\r\non-line at <a href=\"http://activate.uci.edu/\">activate.uci.edu</a>.\r\nAll ICS 23 students need this account, both for using Checkmate, and\r\nalso so that the course staff can email you when necessary. If you have\r\nnot activated your UCInetID, do so immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To use Checkmate once you've activated your UCInetID, all you need to do is go to <a href=\"http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/\">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a>,\r\nlog in using your UCInetID, and follow the instructions there. (If you\r\nget a message about security certificates, just click \"Continue.\")</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any reason to believe that the system isn't working as\r\nyou believe it should, read the instructions carefully, try it a\r\nsecond time, and if you're still having difficulty, send us\r\nan email describing the problem as precisely as possible. If you keep\r\nus informed about problems in a timely way, we will make sure that any\r\nproblems with Checkmate won't affect your grade.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"history\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"nomarker\">\r\n  <li>Adapted from the ICS 22 Summer 2002\r\nversion of this document by Alex Thornton to reflect the exclusive use\r\nof Checkmate, Fall 2002.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body></html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
