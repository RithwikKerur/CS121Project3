I'm\n&gt; just more interested in this level above versioning and am wondering\n&gt; if that concept should be included in the discussions.\n\nI tend to agree.  Getting rev. 1.5 of a page, without finding the\ngraphics in it, or the pages that it links to, at the right\nrevision, is not as effective as \"surfing into the past\".\nHowever, I also think that we need to start small, and work our\nway up.  Given that \"version=foo\" can take /anything/ acceptable\nto the underlying VCS, those systems that support labelling\nrevisions, like RCS, can easily support a basic form of CM.\nSmartening up the client and switching from decorated URLs to a\n(remembered) Content-Version header would allow for links without\nversion information to (client-side) default to an old version of\nthe page.\n\nThis is, I think, stuff that we want to talk about, but not until\nwe've nailed down the basic standards about what URL decorations\nwe're going to describe, if any, the semantics of existing HTTP\nmethods in the face of Content-Version headers or decorated URLs,\nand any additional HTTP methods we find necessary.\n\nAs an aside, I noticed that my last, long message wasn't\nnecessarily as clear on one point as it probably should have\nbeen.  Right now, MKS uses URL decorations for everything.  In\nthe future, we will be tracking the work of this group, and\nconverting from URL decorations to HTTP methods, for those things\nthat logically are methods.  Of course, we'll still end up\nsupporting our existing decorations for a while, since we have\nproduct in the field that understands them, and people may have\npages that contain links to them.\n\n- David\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0011.html\">David J.
