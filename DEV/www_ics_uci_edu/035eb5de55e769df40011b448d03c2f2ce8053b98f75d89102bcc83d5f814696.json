Wolf and David S. Rosenblum in <I>Proceedings of the\nSecond International Conference on the Software Process (ICSP2)</I>,\npages 115-124, Berlin, Germany, February 1993.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nProcess data capture is the activity of obtaining information about an\nexisting software process.  Process analysis is the manipulation of that\ninformation for purposes of problem identification.  Capture and analysis\nare key elements in any strategy for software process improvement.  We have\ndeveloped a model of the software process that is based on a notion of events\ncharacterizing identifiable, instantaneous milestones in a process.  We have\nalso developed capture and analysis techniques suited to that model.  This\npaper reports on a study that was undertaken to gain experience with both the\nmodel and the capture and analysis techniques.  In that study, we captured\nevent data on several actual enactments of the build process of a large,\ncomplex software project within AT&T.  We entered the captured event data\ninto a database and ran several queries against the data.  The queries\nimplement a variety of analyses on the event data by examining relationships\namong events, such as dependencies and time intervals.  The output of the\nqueries are statistical data that can be used to guide the design of process\nimprovements.  While the data we collected in the study are incomplete, our\ninitial results demonstrate the viability of this approach to capture and\nanalysis.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:34:25 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
