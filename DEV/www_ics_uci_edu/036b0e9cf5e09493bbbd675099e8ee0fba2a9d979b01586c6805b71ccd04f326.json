Files will\r\n    be moved to the \"old\" directory from the \"new\" directory by the program.\r\n\r\n4)  Type in the directory where the HTML file should be placed.\r\n\r\n5)  Set the game parameters as desired.\r\n\r\n6)  Click OK, and then click Start.  Games will begin 20 seconds later.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n------\r\n\r\n-Games will be played anytime a new executable is placed in the \"new\" folder.\r\n\r\n-Older versions of executables will be overwritten automatically by newer versions.\r\n\r\n-While no games are playing, the server will check the new directory every 20 seconds.\r\n\r\n-Scoring is based on a winning, and in the event of a tie, the amount of time taken.\r\n\r\nKNOWN BUGS:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n-Occasionally the launched programs will not terminate themselves \r\n (would require implementing process killing after timeout period)", "encoding": "ascii"}
