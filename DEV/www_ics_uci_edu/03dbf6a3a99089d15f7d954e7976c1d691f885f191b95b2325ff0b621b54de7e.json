It does not have his place of birth outside of\r\nAustria.  In fact, I have rarely seen a NY death record with a town of birth.\r\nSuch information is generally confined to immigration records (both ship and\r\nnaturlization) and sometimes in the the 1920 census.  Naturalizations after\r\n1906 were supposed to have the town of birth.\r\n\r\nRemember the cigar guy cousin?  Never got anything from him worth all\r\nthe words, but I think  that his family was the Pesach and Bessie nee\r\nSchector.  The Raphael was, I believe, his grandfather.\r\n\r\nanyway, look for the package I'm sending.  It's the tip of the iceberg.  If\r\nyou could come here for a week, we could wrap this puppy up!  Just kidding.\r\n\r\nSuzan\r\n_____________________________________________________________________  \r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"HOME\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=\"-2\">Last updated 6/24/04</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n     \r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
