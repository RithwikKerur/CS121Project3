We will talk about new protocols for these uses\nand other uses.  TIBCO has been known for building trading systems\nfor the financial world, messaging systems for factories and \napplication integration for corporations worldwide with a $2 Billion\ninstalled base, but, publish / subscribe is more of a revolution\nthan simply another way to do the same old thing.\n \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
