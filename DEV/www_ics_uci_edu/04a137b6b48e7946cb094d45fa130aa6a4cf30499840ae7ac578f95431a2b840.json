In that environment it was very hard (lots of dependencies) to build\nthe Qemu emulator required to run the xv6 operating system. Therefore,\npreviously we relied on a Vagrant VM, i.e.  a full 64bit Linux distribution\nthat was running inside a hardware-assisted virtualization container (VT-x),\ninside which we built Qemu and ran xv6. However, as Openlab machines were\nupdated, it no longer makes sense to start another VM. Now we can simply build\nQemu on the andromeda machines and run xv6 without Vagrant. The instructions\nbelow are now the recommend way to work with this class. \n\n<p> Xv6 is a real operating system kernel, and hence, it needs real hardware to\nboot.  Fortunately, today we can emulate hardware in software. Programs like\nQEMU can emulate functionality of the real physical CPU in software. I.e., QEMU\nimplements the normal CPU loop similar to the one we discussed in class:\nfetches an instruction pointed by the instruction pointer register (EIP),\ndecodes it, performs all permission and condition checks, computes the outcome,\nincrements EIP and continues to the next instruction. Like a real PC platform,\nQEMU emulates hardware boot protocol.  QEMU starts by loading the disk sector\nnumber 0 into the memory location 0x7c00 and jumping to it. Xv6 takes it from\nthere. At a high level, for xv6 it does not matter if it runs on the real\nhardware or under QEMU. Of course, emulation is slower than real hardware, but\nbesides that as long as QEMU implements the logic of the CPU correctly we do\nnot see any deviations from a real baremetal execution. Surprisingly, QEMU is\nreasonably fast, so you as a human barely notice the difference. </p>\n\n<h2>SSH into Openlab (andromeda-XX)</h2>\n\n<p>\nCurrently vagrant is installed on Andromeda machines 1 through 75: <b>andromeda-1.ics.uci.edu</b> to <b>andromeda-75.ics.uci.edu</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore you begin, you need to select an andromeda server for yourself.\n\tWe are following the following method to select a server : \n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Find out your student ID <br>\n\t\t\t(Let's say: 66541280)\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Evaluate serverNumber = (studentIDNumber mod 74) +1\n\t\t\t<br>Ex: 66541280 => 37\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Your server name is : <b>andromeda-{serverNumber}.ics.uci.edu</b>\n\t\t\t<br>Ex: andromeda-37.ics.uci.edu\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n<p>\n\nTo configure your xv6 environment, login to your server\n<pre> \n$ ssh UCInetID@andromeda-XX.ics.uci.edu\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Troubleshooting your Andromeda ssh connection</h3>\n\nIf you get something like <pre> Permission denied\n(publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password) </pre> message from ssh and\nyou're connecting from outside of campus, you need to need to either use\nAnyConnect VPN to tunnel in or setup an SSH keypair for passwordless login.\nOpenlab machines do not accept outside password login attempts.\n\n<h2>Clone and build Qemu</h2>\n\n<p> To run xv6 we need to compile and install a version of the QEMU emulator.\nDefault QEMU's debugging facilities, while powerful, are somewhat immature, so\nit is highly recommend you use a patched version of Qemu which is maintained by\nMIT instead of the stock version that may come with your distribution.\n\nFrom inside your home folder create a new directory for this class. I suggest\nyou start in your home folder (unless you know what you're doing this is a good\nway to go)\n\n<pre> cd ~\n mkdir cs238p</pre>\n\nChange into this new directory\n\n<pre>cd cs238p</pre>\n\nClone the MIT's qemu distribution into the qemu folder  \n\n<pre>git clone https://github.com/mit-pdos/6.828-qemu.git qemu </pre>\n\nChange into qemu folder and initialize another git submodule\n\n<pre>\ncd qemu \ngit submodule update --init pixman\n</pre>\n\nConfigure qemu with minimal settings and the prefix pointing to the install\nfolder \n\n<pre>./configure --disable-kvm --disable-werror --prefix=/home/&lt;YourUCInetID&gt;/cs238p/qemu-install --target-list=\"i386-softmmu x86_64-softmmu\"</pre>\n\nFor example, for me this becomes: \n<pre>./configure --disable-kvm --disable-werror --prefix=/home/aburtsev/cs238p/qemu-install --target-list=\"i386-softmmu x86_64-softmmu\"</pre>\n\nMake and install qemu (this will take some time)\n\n<pre>\nmake -j 8\nmake install\n</pre>\n\nTo make qemu accessible from other programs add it to your path. You can either add it every time you log in to the andromeda machine by exporting the PATH variable, or you can add this line to .bash_profile file in your home folder. \n\n<pre>export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cs238p/qemu-install/bin</pre>\n\nIf you decide to add the PATH permanently to your .bash_profile the line should look \nsomething like\n\n<pre>export PATH=$HOME/cs238p/qemu-install/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH</pre>\n\n\n<h2>Clone, build, and boot xv6</h2>\n\nChange back into the <tt>cs238p</tt> folder and clone xv6 repository. \n\n<pre>cd ~/cs238p\ngit clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git\nCloning into xv6...\n...\n\n</pre>\n\nBuild xv6 (you only will see a bunch of output from the make command that\ninvokes the gcc compiler on all kernel files, links the kernel with ld, creates\nthe kernel file system with all user-level programs that will be available\ninside xv6, and so on): \n\n<pre>$ cd xv6-public \n$ make </pre>\n\n<p> You're now ready to run xv6.\n\n<pre>\n$ make qemu-nox ...  </pre>\n\n<p>You are now running xv6 on top a hardware platform that is emulated by the\nQemu emulator. You are now done with the xv6 setup and can continue moving to any homeworks that are currently assigned. \n\n\n<p>You can find more information about QEMU monitor and GDB\ndebugger <a\nhref=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/labguide.html\">here</a>, feel free\nto explore them.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Old and Deprecated: Instructions for setting up Vagrant xv6\nenvironment</h1> \n\n<h2>Note: this is an old way to run xv6 on Openlab, it's no longer recommended</h2>\n\nUp until summer 2018, Openlab machines were running 32bit operating systems.\nIn that environment it was very hard (lots of dependencies) to build the Qemu\nemulator required to run the xv6 operating system. Therefore, we decided (with\nOpenlab admins) that the easiest way to provide xv6-compatible environment is\nto run it inside a Vagrant VM, i.e. a full 64bit Linux distribution that was\nrunning inside a hardware-assisted virtualization container (VT-x).  However,\nas Openlab machines are updated, it no longer makes sense to start another VM.\nNow we can simply build Qemu on the andromeda machines and run xv6 without\nVagrant. Now we recommend that you follow the native \"xv6 on Openlab\"\ninstructions above.  \n\n<p> Xv6 is a real operating system kernel, and hence, it needs real hardware to\nboot.  Fortunately, today we can emulate hardware in software. Programs like\nQEMU can emulate functionality of the real physical CPU in software. I.e., QEMU\nimplements the normal CPU loop similar to the one we discussed in class:\nfetches an instruction pointed by the instruction pointer register (EIP),\ndecodes it, performs all permission and condition checks, computes the outcome,\nincrements EIP and continues to the next instruction.

Surprisingly, QEMU is\nreasonably fast, so you as a human barely notice the difference. </p>\n\n<p> To run xv6 we need to compile and install a version of the QEMU emulator.\nDue to some compatibility issues it is impossible to compile QEMU directly on\nthe Openlab (andromeda-XX) machines. Instead, we will run yet another virtual \nmachine called Vagrant on the Openlab servers. Vagrant is a user-friendly interface \nto the VirtualBox virtual machine monitor. You will be able to start Vagrant on \nany of the andromeda machines. Vagrant will boot into a version of the Ubuntu \nLinux system. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nCurrently vagrant is installed on Andromeda machines 1 through 75: <b>andromeda-1.ics.uci.edu</b> to <b>andromeda-75.ics.uci.edu</b>.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore you begin, you need to select an andromeda server for yourself.\n\tWe are following the following method to select a server : \n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Find out your student ID <br>\n\t\t\t(Let's say: 66541280)\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Evaluate serverNumber = (studentIDNumber mod 74) +1\n\t\t\t<br>Ex: 66541280 => 37\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li>Your server name is : <b>andromeda-{serverNumber}.ics.uci.edu</b>\n\t\t\t<br>Ex: andromeda-37.ics.uci.edu\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n<p>\n\nTo configure your xv6 environment, login to your server\n<pre> \n$ ssh UCInetID@andromeda-XX.ics.uci.edu\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Troubleshooting your Andromeda ssh connection</h3>\n\nIf you get something like <pre> Permission denied\n(publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic,password) </pre> message from ssh and\nyou're connecting from outside of campus, you need to need to either use\nAnyConnect VPN to tunnel in or setup an SSH keypair for passwordless login.\nOpenlab machines do not accept outside password login attempts.\n\n<h3>Moving forward</h3>\n\nI suggest you create a new folder for your cs238p homeworks, like:\n<pre>\nUCInetID@andromeda-XX$mkdir cs238p\n</pre>\nChange into that directory: \n<pre>\nUCInetID@andromeda-XX$cd cs238p\n</pre>\nFetch a version of the vagrant environment that explains to vagrant what kind of virtual machine you're planning to run:  \n<pre>\nUCInetID@andromeda-XX$ wget http://www.ics.uci.edu/~aburtsev/238P/hw/xv6-vagrant-master.tgz\nUCInetID@andromeda-XX$ tar -xzvf xv6-vagrant-master.tgz\n</pre>\nChange into the new folder\n<pre>\nUCInetID@andromeda-XX$ cd xv6-vagrant-master\n</pre>\nChange the name of the vagrant VM to something unique (otherwise we all end up with the same VM and vagrant is confused). In the <tt>Vagrantfile</tt> file change the following line \n<pre>\n      vb.name = \"xv6_box_anton\" # <--- You should change this to make VM names unique\n</pre>\n\nStart vagrant VM (this will take several minutes as it is building a patched version of QEMU inside)\n<pre>\nUCInetID@andromeda-XX$ vagrant up\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Common Troubleshooting</h2>\n\n<h3>Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...</h3>\n\nIf vagrant fails with the following message:\n<pre>\n==> default: Clearing any previously set forwarded ports...\nVagrant cannot forward the specified ports on this VM, since they\nwould collide with some other application that is already listening\non these ports. The forwarded port to 20000 is already in use\non the host machine.\n\nTo fix this, modify your current project's Vagrantfile to use another\nport. Example, where '1234' would be replaced by a unique host port:\n\n  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 26001, host: 1234\n</pre>\n\nGo ahead with the suggested fix. Change the following line in the Vagrantfile setting the host port to something random below 64000: \n<pre>\n  config.vm.network \"forwarded_port\", guest: 26001, host: 30000\n</pre>\n\n<h3>Timing out while waiting for machine to boot</h3>\n\nIf you're getting something like the above message, maybe your Andromeda server\ndoesn't have VT-x (virtualization extensions enabled, or doesn't have the Linux\nkernel that supports them). You can check by doing\n\n\n<pre>ls /dev/kvm</pre>\n\nThe kvm device should be there. Pick another andromeda machine at random, i.e.,\n74 should be ok.\n\n<h3>A VirtualBox machine with the name '/*my name*/' already exists</h3>\n\nIf you're getting something like: \n\n<pre>A VirtualBox machine with the name '/*my name*/' already exists.  Please\nuse another name or delete the machine with the existing name, and try\nagain.</pre>\n\nFirst check if your VM is still running with two commands ps and grep and\ncombine them with a pipe like this:\n\n<pre>ps -aux | grep VBoxHeadless</pre>\n\nps lists processes in the system, -a -- list all, -u show user who started it,\n-x -- list even the ones that don't have an associated terminal (i.e.,\nVBoxHeadless doesn't have it). grep filters only strings that ps outputs to the\nspecific filter \"VBoxHeadless\". On andromeda-19 it shows you're still running\nsomething.  \n\n\n<p>Then you can try halting vagrant with\n\n<pre>vagrant halt</pre>\n\nIf it doesn't work, try maybe killing the process like\n\n<pre>kill &lt;process_id&gt;</pre>\n\nYou can get <tt>process_id</tt> from ps. If simple kill doesn't work try\n\n<pre>kill -9 &lt;process_id&gt;</pre>\n\nIf a process can ignore kill signal (i.e., normally the OS gives a process a\nchance to save it's state before exiting with this signal). kill -9 will kill\nit without allowing to ignore.\n\nFinally, if you really need to destroy all traces of an exising vagrant VM you\ncan do \n\n<pre>vagrant destroy</pre>\n\n<h2>Logging into Vagrant VM</h2>\n\nIf vagrant VM is up, you're ready to log in inside and start working on your xv6 Linux environment. Log in inside the vagrant VM. From the same folder where Vagrantfile is (i.e., from cs238p/xv6-vagrant-master) type\n<pre>\nUCInetID@andromeda-XX$ vagrant ssh\n</pre>\n</p>\n\nNow you're inside the Linux Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS. Your new vagrant machine should\nhave everything you need to compile and run your xv6 code. Vagrant\nautomatically shares the directory of your host machine where you put the \n`Vagrantfile` file (i.e., the `cs238p/xv6-vagrant-master` folder) as the `/vagrant` \ndirectory of the vagrant VM.  \n\n<h3>Note: power down your VM when you're done!</h3>\n\nWhen you're done playing with your xv6 setup, or more specifically with the xv6 Vagrant VM don't forget to power it down (we have hundreds of people working on these assignments, plus other classes use openlab machines too. \n<pre>\nvagrant halt\n</pre>\n\n\n<h2>Boot xv6</h2> \n\n<b>From inside your Vagrant VM</b> fetch the xv6 source:\n\n<pre>\nvagrant@odin$ cd /vagrant\nvagrant@odin$ mkdir cs238p\nvagrant@odin$ cd cs238p\nvagrant@odin$ git clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git\nCloning into xv6...\n...\n</pre>\n\n\nBuild xv6 (you only will see a bunch of output from the make command that invokes the gcc compiler on all kernel files, links the kernel with ld, creates the kernel file system with all user-level programs that will be available inside xv6, and so on):\n<pre>\nvagrant@odin$ cd xv6-public\nvagrant@odin$ make \n</pre>\n\n<p> You're now ready to run xv6.\n\n<pre>\nvagrant@odin$ make qemu-nox\n...\n</pre>\n\n<p>You can find more information about QEMU monitor and GDB debugger  <a\nhref=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2011/labguide.html\">here</a>, feel free\nto explore them.  </p>\n\n<!--<p>You're now ready to start working on the homework (go back to the <a href=\"hw2-boot-xv6.html\">howework page</a>). -->\n\n<h2>Xv6 on your own Linux system</h2>\n\nWhile we provide instructions for how to use Andromeda machines, you are more than welcome \nto configure and run xv6 on your own laptop, desktop, or VM.  \nIf you decide to use your own environment, see the instructions on the <a\nhref=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/tools.html\">xv6 tools</a> page for\nhow to set up xv6.  I've successfully built xv6 on my Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and later on \nUbuntu 16.04 LTS. I had to install the following packages in order to build QEMU: libz-dev,\nlibtool-bin, libtool, libglib2.0-dev, libpixman-1-dev, libfdt-dev. \n\n\n<h2>XV6 in Docker</h2>\n\n\n<p>In case you want to use run xv6 on your own machine using docker containers, you can try it out as well. \nI have successfully built XV6 using the <b>grantbot/xv6</b> image hosted in the docker <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/grantbot/xv6/\">hub</a><p>\n<p>In my localmachine, I downloaded the XV6 source code as follows : </p>\n<pre>\nlocalhost$ mkdir XV6_Dev\nlocalhost$ cd XV6_Dev\nlocalhost$ git clone git://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git\nCloning into xv6...\n...\n</pre>\n<p>Next, you will need to setup Docker, if you don't have it already on your machine. I followed the instructions from\n\t<a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/\">here.</a>\n\tYou will find similar instructions for other OS as well in the docker website. Once you have the setup ready, download the\n\t<b>grantbot/xv6</b> image using\n<pre>\ndocker pull grantbot/xv6\n</pre>\n<br>\t\nThen you can start the container using\n<pre>\ndocker run -v '/{Path to local XV6 folder}/XV6_Dev':/home/a/XV6_Dev/ -i -t grantbot/xv6\n</pre>\nOnce you have the bash prompt you can type the following to start XV6,\n<pre>\ncd ~/XV6_Dev/\nmake qemu-nox\n</pre>\n</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\t</TD>\t\t\t\n\t</TR>\n\t<TR>\n\t\t<TD ALIGN=\"LEFT\" BGCOLOR=\"#FFFFFF\"><!-- top margin --> \n\t\t\t<IMG SRC=\"./images/spacer.gif\" WIDTH=\"100%\" HEIGHT=\"15\" ALT=\"\" BORDER=\"0\"/>\n\t\t</TD>\n\t</TR>\n\t<TR>\n\t<TD COLSPAN=\"4\">\n\t\t<DIV ID=\"tech\">Updated: October, 2018</DIV>\n\t</TD>\n\t</TR>\n\t</TABLE>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
