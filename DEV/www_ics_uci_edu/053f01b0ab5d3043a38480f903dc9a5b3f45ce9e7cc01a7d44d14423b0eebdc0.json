The \nsystem tries to address several issues that DNS could not or is \nhard to overcome, including service scalability, namespace \ninternationalization, and distributed administration. The Handle \nSystem defines a hierarchical namespace, a self-contained data and \nservice model, and a specific protocol that supports both secured \nname resolution and administration over the Internet. It also \nproposes an interesting concept called \"service information\" vs. \ntraditional server (or host) information used by most client/server \napplications. The \"service information\" allows multiple servers to \nbe utilized as a single service unit for efficiency and scalability \nreasons.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/twist/twist99/\">\nTWIST 99</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
