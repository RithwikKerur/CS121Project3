An arrow labeled \"a/b,D\" means that if the machine sees the \ncharacter \"a\", it replaces it by \"b\", moves in direction D (either left \nor right), and changes state as indicated by the arrow.  An arrow labeled \nby \"a/accept\" or \"a/reject\" means the machine halts and accepts or rejects \nthe string as indicated.  The unlabeled arrow indicates the start state.\nA dash indicates the blank character.\n\n<CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"hw4tm.gif\">\n</CENTER>\n\n<OL>\n<P><LI>Indicate for each of the following strings whether the machine above \naccepts, rejects, or goes into an infinite loop without halting: 01, 10, \n011, 001, 0011.\n\n<P><FONT COLOR=RED><I>Note: there was a mistake in the Turing machine; the \ntop arrow is supposed to be labeled \"-/-,R\" rather than \"-/-,L\".\nOther than this mistake, the machine is essentially the same as one for \nrecognizing strings of balanced parentheses (but with the character zero \ninstead of left parentheses and the character one instead of right \nparentheses).  But because \nof this mistake, the problem was easier than it should have been.\n\n<P>The answers for the machine given are that it rejects 10 and accepts all \nthe other strings.\n\n<P>The answers for the machine I intended to write are that it accepts 01 \nand 0011, rejects 10 and 011, and goes into a loop for 001.\n</I></FONT>\n\n<P><LI>Find a Turing machine that accepts strings of 0's and 1's only when the \nnumber of 1's is a power of two.\n\n<P><I>(Hint: repeatedly pass left-to-right \nacross the string to test whether there is exactly one \"1\" left, and \nright-to-left across the string changing every other \"1\" into a \"0\").</I>\n\n<CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"hw4p2.gif\">\n</CENTER>\n\n<P><LI>Why is it impossible to prove Church's thesis mathematically?\n<P><FONT COLOR=RED><I>\nAnswer: because Church's thesis (namely, the idea that any computer we can \nactually build can be simulated by a Turing machine) is partially about \nthe real world, and is therefore a statement of \nphysics rather than purely mathematical.  Physical theories can be \ndisproven by experiments but can never be proven mathematically.\n</I></FONT></OL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
