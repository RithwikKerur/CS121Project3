Often\nthis difficulty can be shown mathematically, in the form of\ncomputational intractibility results: every NP-complete problem is\nin some sense a puzzle, and conversely many puzzles are\nNP-complete. Two-player games often have higher complexities such\nas being PSPACE-complete. \n\n<p><i>WW</i> (pp. 218-219; see <a href=\"#refs\">references</a>\nbelow) is disparaging of this sort of result, writing that \"this\nasymptotic result says little about the difficulties of calculating\ngood strategies\", describing NP-hard game positions as \"degenerate\"\nand \"relatively dull\", and advocating (as a response to hardness\nproofs) looking for additional rules and conditions that would make\nthe game easier. But to me NP-completeness is not the end but the\nbeginning of the study of a game: it shows that the game is complex\nenough that we can encode interesting computational problems within\nit. If a game is in P, it becomes no fun once you learn \"the trick\"\nto perfect play, but hardness results imply that there is no such\ntrick to learn: the game is inexhaustible. And of course\nNP-completeness or PSPACE-completeness doesn't even rule out the\npossibility of computing game values exactly; true, it seems to\nimply that worst-case-exponential algorithms are required, but\nthere is still plenty of interesting work in designing, analyzing,\nand implementing such algorithms.</p>\n\n<p>There is a curious relationship between computational difficulty\nand puzzle quality. To me, the best puzzles are NP-complete\n(although some good puzzles are in P, relying on gaps in human\nintuition rather than on computational complexity for their\ndifficulty). Some puzzles are even harder than NP (for instance,\nsliding block puzzles and Sokoban are PSPACE-complete) but to me\nthis means only that the problem can have an annoyingly long\nsequence of manipulations in its solution. For two-player games,\none encounters a similar phenomenon at a higher level of\ncomplexity. The tree of potential interactions in a game typically\ngives rise to PSPACE-completeness results of a sort I find more\ninteresting than PSPACE-completeness in puzzles. However some games\nare harder, EXPTIME-complete, which to me means that it may\nsometimes be necessary for a well-played game to go on for a\ntediously long sequence of moves. Perhaps some games or puzzles in\nwhich the players start with incomplete knowledge of the game or\npuzzle configuration might lead to other types of completeness\n(e.g. MA-completeness or #P-completeness) for finding the starting\nmove most likely to succeed, but I know of no such results.</p>\n\n<p>I primarily list here real games and puzzles, games that were\ninvented to be played, rather than to be analyzed. So I'm not\nincluding some of the more artificial entries in e.g. <i>WW</i> or\n<i>GJ</i>, such as \"sequential truth assignment\". If someone can\npoint me to a tournament for these games, a copy of the game sold\nin stores, or a program for people to play them against their\ncomputers, I'll consider adding them.</p>\n\n<p>One caveat: NP-completeness is not a concept that applies to a\nsingle puzzle or game position, or even a finite collection of\npositions. It only makes sense to talk about an infinite family of\nproblems as being NP-complete. For this reason games like chess\ncannot themselves be NP-complete, as they only have a finite\n(albeit unthinkably large) number of possible positions. In many\ncases however there is a natural generalization from some finite\ngame or puzzle to an infinite family of game positions on\narbitrarily large game boards, in which it makes sense to talk\nabout NP-completeness. The fact that these infinite generalizations\nare computationally hard gives us some justification for believing\nthat the original finite games are also hard in some less\nwell-defined sense.</p>\n\n<h3>Index:</h3>\n\n<p>Puzzles and solitaire games:\n<a href=\"#cryptarith\">Alphametics</a>;\n<a href=\"#samegame\">Clickomania</a>;\n<a href=\"#cryptarith\">Cryptarithms</a>;\n<a href=\"#cubic\">Cubic</a>;\n<a href=\"#15\">15-puzzle</a>;\n<a href=\"#ii\">Instant Insanity</a>;\n<a href=\"#kplumber\">KPlumber</a>;\n<a href=\"#shang\">Mah Jongg</a>;\n<a href=\"#pearls\">Pearl puzzles</a>;\n<a href=\"#rush\">Rush Hour</a>;\n<a href=\"#shang\">Shanghai</a>;\n<a href=\"#sok\">Sokoban</a></p>\n\n<p>Two-player games:\n<a href=\"#amazons\">Amazons</a>;\n<a href=\"#hex\">Bridge-It</a>;\n<a href=\"#checkers\">Checkers</a>;\n<a href=\"#chess\">Chess</a>;\n<a href=\"#dots\">Dots and boxes</a>;\n<a href=\"#checkers\">Draughts</a>;\n<a href=\"#go\">Go</a>;\n<a href=\"#hex\">Hex</a>;\n<a href=\"#mastermind\">Mastermind</a>;\n<a href=\"#othello\">Othello</a>;\n<a href=\"#phutball\">Phutball</a>;\n<a href=\"#othello\">Reversi</a>;\n<a href=\"#hex\">Shannon switching game</a>;\n<a href=\"#twixt\">Twixt</a></p>\n\n<a name=\"refs\"><h3>Some useful general references:</h3></a>\n\n<ul>\n<li>E.

(Joint with Michiel de Bondt; an earlier reduction listed here until early 2016 was not valid.)\nWe have a different type of tile for each variable, clause, and term\n(appearance of a variable in a clause) of the 3-SAT instance, with four\ncopies of each type of tile.

If this pairing\nis done according to a satisfying assignment, it will then be possible\nto match the term tiles from all of the chosen variable stacks, freeing\nat least one copy of each clause tile. The freed clause tiles can then\nbe used to complete the pairing of the big stack, which in turn allows\nthe remaining variable, term, and clause tiles to be paired.

After placing a vertex, the\nplayer may remove some of his own edges or add more of them.\nNo two edges may cross.\nThe object is (like <a href=\"#hex\">Hex</a>) to connect opposite sides of\nthe board by a path.\n\n<p>Status: NP-complete to determine whether a single set of vertices can\nsupport a connecting path. PSPACE-complete to determine the game value, by a\nreduction from <a href=\"#hex\">Hex</a>.</p>\n\n<p>References:\n<ul>\n<li>D. Mazzoni and\nK.
