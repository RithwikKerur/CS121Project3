We present the work of Addad et al., who build on the work of Dasgupta (2016) in defining an appropriate cost function which should be optimized by the hierarchy a clustering produces. The authors define \"admissible\" cost functions as those which find their optimum when a clustering recovers a \"ground truth\" from which an input was generated, and show that these functions have certain properties. Under a suitable cost function, the authors analyze the performance of linkage-based and other clustering algorithms. They present a new algorithm which improves on the worst-case performance of these algorithms.\n\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBased on a paper by Vincent Cohen-Addad, Varun Kanade, Frederik Mallman-Trenn, Claire Mathieu:</br> <a href=\"https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611975031.26\">https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611975031.26</a>\n</p>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
