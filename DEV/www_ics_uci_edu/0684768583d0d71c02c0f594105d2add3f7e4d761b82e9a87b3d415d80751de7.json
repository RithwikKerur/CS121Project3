Triton\nis an object-oriented database management system designed to support\nthe Arcadia software engineering environment.  It can be used as a\ngeneral purpose DBMS, although it has specialized features to support\nthe software process capabilities in Arcadia in the form of the APPL/A\nlanguage.  Triton was developed as prototype to explore the\nrequirements for software environments and to provide prototypical\nsolutions.  By making these requirements known it is hoped that better\nsolutions will eventually be provided by the database community.\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:32:43 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
