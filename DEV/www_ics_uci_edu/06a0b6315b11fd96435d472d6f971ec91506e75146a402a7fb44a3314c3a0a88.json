Today a wide variety of techniques, not only in the classroom\nbut in labs and faculty offices and cyberspace, can make a large introductory\ncourse an extremely effective educational experience. We explore these practices,\nwith pointers for further information, as a guide for instructors or departments\nfaced with the large-course model of instruction.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>THE CHALLENGES OF LARGE CLASSES</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Introductory computer science courses present\ntheir own unique challenges. The range of student backgrounds may be very\nwide in a single course, from complete novices to students with many years\nof self-taught experience. The specification of programming assignments,\nlike the specification of any software, is notoriously difficult. Assignments,\nparticularly those involving production of software, are voluminous and\nrequire painstaking evaluation. The time demands on students are greater\nthan in non-laboratory courses, and they increase further as more open-ended\nprojects are assigned.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Couple this with an enrollment of 100 students\nor more (in some institutions, enrollments of 500 are not unheard of), and\nthe challenges multiply.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>We will characterize these issues below, and go\non to consider practices and strategies that may help resolve these difficulties\nand occasionally even turn them to advantage.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Increased Size, Increased Workload</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Outside of the classroom itself, the work of grading\nand individual assistance increases at least linearly with enrollment. Also,\nif the students in a course are distributed normally, the distance between\nthe strongest and the weakest will probably be much greater than in a small\nclass, which means that the students at either end of the scale are likely\nto require even more extra attention.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Even the effort of preparing materials, assignments,\nand exams is greater in a large course, with more concentrated advance preparation.\nExamination questions that can be graded rapidly (of which multiple-choice\nquestions are an extreme example) typically require more preparation time\nthan open-ended questions, but as enrollments increase, the value of that\ntradeoff changes. Likewise, extra time spent perfecting the specifications\nof lab assignments becomes essential with higher enrollments, since fielding\nindividual questions to clarify ambiguities or errors from, say, 20% of\nthe students becomes unmanageable as the class size increases. This added\npreparation time is a significant extra burden in teaching large courses.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Student Anonymity</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>In large classes, individual students can remain\nlargely anonymous. This can result in inattention--think of students in\nthe back of the room reading the newspaper or, more currently, playing solitaire\non their laptop computers. Inattention can produce apathy and disconnectedness--\nwhen the teacher takes an active personal interest in a student&#39;s progress,\nthe student works harder and learns better, but personal contact is limited\nin a large class. The ultimate result may be attrition--when students are\nnot engaged and their performance suffers, they find it easy simply to slip\naway.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Distributing the Work Yields Inconsistency</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Distributed processing addresses many of these\nproblems, as we divide students into smaller discussion and lab sections\nand apportion their work to assistants for grading. But this leads to yet\nanother problem: inconsistency in what the students learn and in the grades\nthey receive.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>TECHNIQUES AND STRATEGIES</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Below we catalog many of the strategies successful\ninstructors have used for resolving these issues.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Course Organization</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>As mentioned above, the classic organizational\napproach to accommodating the increased workload in a large course is to\ncreate discussion and/or lab sections, which might range in size from 5\nto 30 students. Later we describe strategies for dealing with the potential\nfor inconsistency.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>One alternative organization is self-paced courses\n(as at the University of California, Berkeley</FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_79\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>),\nin which students learn independently, on their own schedule, making an\nappointment with a grader as they complete each assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Another approach is to eliminate the large lecture\nentirely, conducting each section independently. CMU follows this approach,\nin which the only unifying element is a common examination at the end of\nthe term. </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_78\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_76\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_73\">Endnotes</A></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Many institutions offer a variety of introductory\ncourses, some more gentle and some more accelerated than the mainstream\ncourse. To eliminate some attrition, students might be permitted to transfer\nfrom one course to another more flexibly--perhaps at a later point in the\nterm--than is the norm.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Even in a single course, some variation in assignments\ncan accommodate a wider range of students. Contests or extra credit can\ngive the strongest students an opportunity to shine. </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_72\">Endnotes</A></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>In the Classroom</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>A variety of active learning techniques can keep\nstudents engaged with the material in class. At intervals during the lecture,\nthe instructor can ask the students to spend a few minutes working out a\nproblem, either individually or in small groups. </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_71\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_70\">Endnotes</A></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Passing out overhead transparencies and pens allows\nsome students to share their work, providing valuable discussion material\nfor the whole class.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>With the greater availability of in-class computers\nand projection equipment, real-time demonstrations become more feasible.\nWhile an entire class period in a darkened room may tax any student&#39;s\nability to stay awake, judicious use of these techniques can be highly effective\nat maintaining interest. </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_69\">Endnotes</A></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>As size increases, the number of students who\nmust unavoidably miss class increases as well. Audio- or videotaping lectures\nand making the tapes available for later review provides students an easy\nway to catch up, and one more complete and effective than just relying on\na classmate&#39;s notes. In general, fostering a sense of community in the\ncourse helps keep students engaged. Eric Roberts points out that the energy\nand momentum of a large class may provide an advantage over small classes.\n</FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_68\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>\nCommunity can be fostered by running jokes, by class parties, by a course\nweb page or on-line discussion group.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Out of the Classroom</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Student alienation decreases when the instructor\nis accessible outside of class. The solitary lecturer appears distant and\nunapproachable; having frequent office hours and repeatedly soliciting attendance\nhelps break the barrier down. At UC Irvine, the campus subsidizes a &quot;take-a-\nprofessor-to-lunch&quot; program in which a group of five students may invite\na professor to lunch in any campus food facility; each student receives\na one-dollar discount and the faculty member gets a free lunch, above and\nbeyond the opportunity for interaction on a human scale.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Learning students&#39; names is another tried-and-true\ntechnique. Learning over 100 names may not be feasible for every instructor,\nbut these techniques make it possible to learn a significant proportion:\nRequire each student to provide a snapshot (with the name on the back) and\nreview them like flash cards, or have every student give his or her name\nbefore asking in-class questions.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Electronic mail (sent privately and individually\nto the instructor or assistants) and on-line bulletin boards or news groups\n(with postings accessible to the entire class) can be channels for class\nannouncements, questions, and discussion, greatly enhancing availability\nand creating community.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>One flexible approach to managing the volume of\nmessages is to have a course mailing address that goes to the entire teaching\nstaff. Then, whoever reads the mail first can reply to it, with a copy back\nto the list so that the others will know a response has been sent. This\nprovides rapid turnaround for the students, distributes the correspondence\nworkload, and gives the instructor a real-time picture of how the course\nis going. Any messages of general interest to the class can be posted or\nforwarded to the group as a whole (perhaps with identifying information\nremoved).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Web-based software </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_67\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>\ncan maintain archives of official announcements and can, by coordination\nwith the registrar, maintain electronic class mailing lists that reflect\nup-to-date enrollments. Of course the Web and other technologies can help\nwith a variety of course-management tasks. </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_66\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_65\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_64\">Endnotes</A></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Assignments and Grading</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Even when courses are divided into sections, often\nthe students take a common exam. To preserve consistency across sections\nwhen grading the exam, it is best for a single individual to grade every\nstudent&#39;s response to a given question. Where the enrollment is too\nlarge to permit this, great care must be taken to design formal rubrics\nor grading standards and to ensure adherence to it by cross-checking graded\nproblems periodically during the process. </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_63\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>\n This is time well spent, because students do compare their results and\nwill focus laser-like on any perceived inconsistency.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Programming assignments are no exception to the\ngeneral difficulty of specifying software requirements. Questions about\nan assignment&#39;s requirements always arise, and teaching staff may quite\nreasonably give contradictory answers. Expecting to eliminate all ambiguity,\nat least in larger, design-oriented assignments, is unrealistic.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>One approach to this issue is to let each section\nleader make these small decisions for his or her section, assign grades\naccordingly, and perhaps recognize the lack of comparability among sections\nwhen assigning final grades, as described below.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>A second approach is to identify for each assignment\na single person with decision-making authority, typically one of the section\nleaders. Other section leaders will defer all substantive questions to this\nauthority, who will issue consistent answers and clarifications (electronic\nmail or bulletin boards help immensely here). This authority can also take\nthe lead in grading that assignment consistently with his or her pronouncements,\nby preparing the scoring standards if not by doing all the grading. Of course\nthis decision-making position could rotate among the teaching staff from\none assignment to the next.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>When setting grades, the conventional approach\nis to grade the entire class on one scale (be it curved or fixed). In a\ntypical course, lab assignments might count for 40% of the course grade\nand exams might count 60%. The exams might well be graded comparably across\nsections, as described above. The assignments, however, would more typically\nbe graded by a different person for each section. Those scores might also\nbe comparable across sections, perhaps by following the practices described\nabove, but often they are not. How, then, can we assign course grades consistently?</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>One approach to smoothing out these inconsistencies\nis to normalize the scores across sections, raising the scores for sections\nthat appear to have harsher grading. However, this approach presumes that\nthe populations of each section are comparable, which is probably not realistic.\nAnother approach is simply to recognize the lack of comparability, treating\neach section as an independently graded course which happens to have 60%\nof its grading in common with the other sections. To follow this approach,\nthe instructor must explain to students from the outset that grades are\nnot comparable across sections because each grader grades differently; the\ninstructor must also meet with each section leader to set the grades, perhaps\nusing the common 60% from the exam scores to constrain the variation among\nsections.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Staff Management</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>A major part of the workload in teaching large\ncourses is managing the teaching staff--teaching assistants, section leaders,\nlab assistants, tutors, graders, and so on. Recruiting graduate students\nas teaching assistants is harder in computer science than in many disciplines,\nbecause computer science students have opportunities for research assistantships\nor outside employment that are often not available to students in other\nareas. One often-overlooked source of teaching staff is advanced undergraduate\nstudents; with appropriate selection and training, they can be extremely\neffective section leaders, tutors, and graders. Moreover, often they are\npaid at a lower rate than graduate students, providing more staffing for\nthe same price. </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_62\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_61\">Endnotes</A></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Some people may be born with teaching talent,\nbut every section leader should be exposed to departmental policies and\nthe issues surrounding teaching undergraduates in the university (including\nrespect for diverse backgrounds); nor should their first experience speaking\nbefore a group or grading students&#39; work be in the section they lead.\nProspective or first-time section leaders should have some kind of training\nas described in </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_60\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Above and beyond training, the teaching staff\nof a large course should meet periodically to compare notes, coordinate\npolicies, discuss current difficulties, and exchange experiences. Staff\nmeetings are an important way for the instructor to get feedback about the\nprogress of the course from the people on the front lines. In-person meetings\nwork better than electronic mail exchanges alone, because they provide a\nspecific time to focus on the course.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>In the Lab</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Having lab partners, group work, and peer testing\nof students&#39; programs can all diminish feelings of alienation, as can\nface-to-face grading.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>Electronic submission of programs and automated\ntesting of correctness can not only make the grading workload more manageable,\nbut also provide a more thorough assessment than traditional grading and\nfree the grader&#39;s time to consider issues such as design, style, interface,\nand documentation, which are not amenable to automated assessment. </FONT><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_59\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_58\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_57\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_56\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_55\">Endnotes</A><A HREF=\"large_intro_courses_gt_files/endnotes.html#_54\">Endnotes</A></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Viewing the Future</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>With the advent of the World-Wide Web and an increased\nfocus on distance education, one might expect introductory courses to be\nlarger still in the future. Yet such classes, typically asynchronous as\nwell as geographically distributed, would have less cohesion and sense of\ncommunity than a traditional course. The information bandwidth for electronically\nmediated courses--even with live, real-time video--is still much narrower\nthan for in-person contact. &quot;The next best thing to being there&quot;\nis indeed second-best; educators estimate that an instructor&#39;s words\naccount for less than half the information conveyed in a classroom. Even\nin a large lecture hall, the fine points of an instructor&#39;s intonation,\ngestures, and body language, as well as the reactions and rustling of the\naudience, add information to the presentation that electronic means typically\ndon&#39;t capture. While technology can improve large courses in many ways,\nin-person instruction is unlikely to disappear, certainly not without a\nsignificant diminution of pedagogical effectiveness.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=2><B>Conclusion</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>We have described a wide range of ways to enhance\nthe quality of large introductory courses.
