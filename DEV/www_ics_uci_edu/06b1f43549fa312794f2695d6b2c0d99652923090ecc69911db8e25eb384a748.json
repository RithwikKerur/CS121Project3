This is an astonishing accomplishment; \nhowever, none of the appeal, power, or grandeur of the virtual can deny \nour existence in a physical world in which location, proximity, and \ndirection are fundamental attributes.  These two worlds, virtual and \nphysical, lie largely disjoint and, with rare exception, disconnected.\n \n<p>\n\nThe next challenge awaiting Internauts is a grand unification of the\nphysical and virtual worlds in which any geospatial location\nand orientation is as legitimate a virtual address as a traditional Web\nuniversal resource name.\nIntegrating geospatial coordinates into the namespace of the Internet\nwill permit the  seamless overlay\nof the virtual onto the physical in which the entire three-dimensional\nworld is a set of resource names.\nThis namespace allows us to attach information and services to specific\nlocations in the physical world.\nHowever, raw geospatial locations are no more useful or convenient than\na naked IP address.\nThe geospatial world will require a range and complexity of higher-level\nnaming services that make the present\nday Internet domain name service look like child's play.\n \n<p>\n\nI will conduct a whirlwind tour of the issues of geospatial namespaces\nfrom the bottom up\nby surveying the technology of location awareness, briefly discussing\nthe issues of geospatial addressing,\nand then turning to higher-order geospatial namespaces.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/twist/twist99/\">\nTWIST 99</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
