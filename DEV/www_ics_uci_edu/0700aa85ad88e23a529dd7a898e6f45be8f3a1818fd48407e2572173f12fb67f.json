The same device ID means the data came from the same deivce.<br>\n2 Entry ID: A sequence number we gave to each datapoint on a device. This number is unique within a device.<br>\n3 Time: The time in epoch milliseconds when the entry was generated.<br>\n4 Sensor Type: The sensor type for which the datapoint is related to. 1 = Microphone, 2 = Camera, 3 = GPS<br>\n5 Entry Type: The type of this entry. 0 = Real Notifications Displayed, 1 = Fake Notifications Displayed, 2 = Users' responses, 3 = Users used the \"See Sample\" feature to look at what certain notifications looked like<br>\n6 Notification Type: The notification channel that was used. 2 = Blinking LED, 3 = Constant Vibration, 5 = Display Notifications, 6 = Android Notifications, 7 = Sound<br>\n7 Ambient Light: In lux.<br>\n8 Ambient Noise: In Amplitude.<br>\n9 Volume Level<br>\n10 Do Not Disturb Mode: 0 = Do Not Disturb mode off, 1 = Do Not Disturb mode on<br>\n11 Status: If this is a real/faked notification, this column indicates whether the notification has displayed. 1 = Not Displayed, 2 = Displayed. A notification that have not displayed may due to the phone is off during the time.<br>\n12 Screen Status: 0 = Screen is on, 1 = Screen is off<br>\n<br> <br>\n    \n  </div></body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
