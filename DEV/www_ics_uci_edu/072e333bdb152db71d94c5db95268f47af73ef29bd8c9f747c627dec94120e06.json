My former colleague forwarded your message\nto me. I'm happy to check the Langsam web site. I'll also tell my \nfather. I'd heard about Pesach Langsam before. I assume that he's \nthe first one to take the Langsam surname.\n\nThank you,\n\nBarbara Langsam Shuman (see more detail <a href=\"shuman.htm\">here</a>)\n_______________________________________________________\nDate: Tue, 17 Dec 2002 20:34:14 -0500\nTo: Babshuman@aol.com\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com>\nSubject: Re: Fwd: Barbara Langsam Shuman -- a response\n\nHi,\n\nThanks for your reply. Can you tell me more about your ancestry? Who is \nthe earliest LANGSAM in your line that you know of. From where was this \nperson from.\n\nAlso, to ease your navigation within the website, you can go directly to \nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/langsam.htm\n\nMoishe\n_______________________________________________________\nFrom: Babshuman@aol.com \nDate: Wed, 18 Dec 2002 09:54:43 EST \nSubject: Re: Barbara Langsam Shuman -- a response \nTo: moishe@langsam.com \nX-Mailer: AOL 7.0 for Windows US sub 10679 \n\nMoishe -- sorry about that.  The earliest Langsam that I know of would be \nmy grandfather's father, whose name was Shuel, or Shoel. My father was \nnamed after him and my father's Hebrew name is pronounced (as he was \ncalled and pronounces it, I suppose it's the Yiddish form) Shoel.  My \ngrandfather was born in 1890, in a village near Vienna in what was then \npart of  Austro-Hungary.  He came to this country in 1906 and settled in \nthe St. Louis area.\n\nTake care,\n\nBarbara \n_______________________________________________________\n\nDate: Wed, 18 Dec 2002 11:04:28 -0500\nTo: Babshuman@aol.com\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com>\nSubject: Re: Barbara Langsam Shuman -- a response\n\nHi,\nI think I found your branch.

And yes, my mother's name is \nEsther. \n\nAnd yes, Harry Langsam was my grandfather's older brother. And yes, his \noffspring are our cousins and we know them well.  My grandfather had \nanother brother, Morris, who married Rose (I think maiden name Fish). \nShe was my grandmother's aunt. My grandmother was Flora Fish, and I think \nher mother's maiden name was Spira, which I see is a family name of other \nLangsam relatives. I know that my grandparents came from the same area in \nEurope.\n\nHow did Pesach Langsam take the surname \"Langsam\"?  You know that it is \nGerman for \"slowly\". Was your direct ancestor a Miller by profession? I know \nthat that's how many surnames were adopted then.\n\nBest,\n\nBarbara \n_______________________________________________________\n<P>\nFrom <a href=\"http://magazine.wustl.edu/Fall00/classmates.html\">http://magazine.wustl.edu/Fall00/classmates.html</a>:\n<p>\n<table width=\"500\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\">\n  <tr valign=\"top\"> \n    <td width=\"330\" height=\"611\"> \n      <div align=\"left\">  <p><span class=\"storybody\"><b>Barbara</b> <b>Langsam Shuman, </b>LA 75, \n          is in the second year of her term as president of the board of directors \n          of the <i>St. Louis Jewish Light</i> newspaper.
