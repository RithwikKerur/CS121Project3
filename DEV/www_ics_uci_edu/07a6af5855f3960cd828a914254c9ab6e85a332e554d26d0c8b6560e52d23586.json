When people say things like \"Check Out the\nSource\" I get worried. As I mentioned previously there are cases where\nthe number of links between the final version of an entity and the\noriginal version contains many nodes. Rather than trying to put together\na \"GET for Edit\" which will either only have one level and thus is not\nvery useful or will hack the hell out itself to support more levels we\nshould just support links which solve the problem very elegantly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYaron\n\n&gt;----------\n&gt;From: \tChristopher Seiwald[SMTP:seiwald@perforce.com]\n&gt;Sent: \tTuesday, September 03, 1996 4:38 PM\n&gt;To: \t<a href=\"mailto:w3c-dist-auth@w3.org;\">w3c-dist-auth@w3.org;</a> www-vers-wg@ics.UCI.EDU\n&gt;Subject: \tRe: Seiwald Q &amp; A -- \"GET for EDIT\" cookies\n&gt;\n&gt;| From: \"Roy T. Fielding\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:fielding@liege.ICS.UCI.EDU\">fielding@liege.ICS.UCI.EDU</a>&gt;\n&gt;|\n&gt;| &gt; \tNow Roy Fielding says that Content-Version is opaque and could\n&gt;| &gt; \tbe used exactly for this purpose, 'cause no one would be the wiser\n&gt;| &gt; \tif the Content-Version were different for each checkout of the\n&gt;| &gt; \tsame document.  This is true, but now the names of these fields\n&gt;| &gt; \tare losing their meaning, no?  If it's checkout context, call it\n&gt;| &gt; \t\"Checkout-Context\" (or \"Checkout-Cookie\").\n&gt;|\n&gt;| Checkout does not have meaning on all systems, whereas version has a\n&gt;generic\n&gt;| meaning (at times, too generic). It is intended to be as flexible as\n&gt;possible.\n&gt;| The \"Content-\" prefix is a requirement of MIME for what HTTP calls\n&gt;| entity-header field names.\n&gt;\n&gt;Not to beat a dead horse (but this one's still kicking):\n&gt;\n&gt;I'm pushing for us to recognise \"checkout\" as a meaningful act for the\n&gt;version abstraction we are trying to support, whether or not the underlying\n&gt;system can make real use of it.  It means \"GET the SOURCE for EDIT\".\n&gt;\"GET\" because the document has to be fetched (or via existing methods\n&gt;determined that the user has the requested copy), \"the SOURCE\" because\n&gt;the user needs the document as it is prior to any server-side\n&gt;interpretation, and \"for EDIT\" so that the VC backend is aware of the\n&gt;user's activity.\n&gt;\n&gt;All VC systems can cook up a checkout cookie; some VC system will have\n&gt;difficulty without one.  The simpler systems - RCS, SCCS, and CVS may\n&gt;well be wrapped with some layer that provides the context.\n&gt;\n&gt;Here's how I see them being used, again with Perforce thrown into the\n&gt;mix because it has fairly modern VC semantics:\n&gt;\n&gt;\t\tCHECKOUT\t\tLOCK\t\t\tCHECKIN\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;RCS\t\tProbably just\t\tVerifies that\t\tVerifies\n&gt;SCCS\t\temits URL+version,\tthe cookie\t\tthat cookie\n&gt;\t\tso that the\t\trepresents\t\trepresents\n&gt;\t\tsubsequent\t\tthe head rev.\t\tLOCKed rev.\n&gt;\t\tLOCK or SUBMIT\t\tMay be a no-op\n&gt;\t\tcan make sure user \tif the SCCS/RCS\n&gt;\t\thas the head rev.\twrapper does\n&gt;\t\tMay imply LOCK,\t\tLOCK on CHECKOUT.\n&gt;\t\tsince RCS/SCCS don't\n&gt;\t\tnormally support\n&gt;\t\tunlocked checkout.\n&gt;\n&gt;CVS\t\tEmits the line\t\tThrows up its\t\tVerifies\n&gt;\t\tfrom the CVS/Entries\thands because\t\tthat cookie\n&gt;\t\tfile that reflects\tCVS doesn't\t\trepresents\n&gt;\t\tthe file+rev being\tsupport locking.\thead rev.\n&gt;\t\tedited.\n&gt;\n&gt;ClearCase\tEmits view-extended\tVerifies that\t\tVerifies\n&gt;\t\tpathname and rev of\tcookie represents\tthat cookie\n&gt;\t\tfile being checked out.\tchecked-out file\trepresents\n&gt;\t\tBecause of CC's auto-\tand does a CC\t\tLOCKed rev.\n&gt;\t\tbranching, the rev may\treserved checkout.\n&gt;\t\tbe different that what\n&gt;\t\twas requested.\n&gt;\n&gt;Perforce\tEmits client pathname\tVerifies that\t\tVerfies\n&gt;\t\tand rev of file\t\tcookie represents\tthat cookie\n&gt;\t\tbeing checked out.\tchecked out file.\trepresents\n&gt;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thead rev.\n&gt;\n&gt;There is use for the checkout cookie for all these systems, even if the\n&gt;cookied degrades into being little more than \"Content-Version\".  Since\n&gt;All VC systems can make use of the cookies, and some need them for sane\n&gt;operation (checkin without checkout under clearcase is a no-go), it makes\n&gt;sense to use a single tag across all underlying VC systems.\n&gt;\n&gt;IMHO, of course.\n&gt;\n&gt;Christopher\n&gt;\n&gt;\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0153.html\">David G.
