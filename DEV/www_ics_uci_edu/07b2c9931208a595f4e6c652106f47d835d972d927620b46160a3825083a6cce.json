See\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/hrshelka.htm\r\n\r\nI think your grandmother Mania is a younger sibling not listed on that webpage.\r\n\r\nAlso, we believe that H93, Hersh Langsam, was a brother to H24, Isaac Langsam. \r\nCan you confirm if your families knew of each other? \r\nSee: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/isac-h24.htm\r\n\r\nRandy, exactly how are you a grandchild to Mania?\r\n\r\nMoishe Miller\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nSubject: \tRe: The JewishGen Family Finder: mania langsam\r\nFrom: \tRandy Mahler <RMahler@carlin-group.com>\r\nDate: \tThu, May 25, 2017 1:33 pm\r\nTo: \t\"moishe.miller@totalben.com\" <moishe.miller@totalben.com>\r\n\r\nMoishe, my father harry mahler is mania langsam Mahler's son as well as she had \r\na daughter elka mahler.

I found myself having \r\nthe same issue with my grandfather's records as well but I had just recently found \r\nout that my great grandfather on my grandfathers side had 13 children and refuse to \r\npay the rabbi to have his children acknowledged by the local temple in their town of \r\nKrosno poland \r\n\r\nSent from my iPhone\r\n\r\nRandy Mahler | Representative, Retail Operations\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSubject: \tRE: The JewishGen Family Finder: mania langsam\r\nFrom: \tmoishe.miller@totalben.com\r\nDate: \tThu, May 25, 2017 1:41 pm\r\nTo: \t\"Randy Mahler\" <RMahler@carlin-group.com>\r\n\r\nSuzan Wynne, another Langsam Cousin, has done extensive research in Poland. See below \r\nwhat she had recorded about your specific family. Perhaps you should be looking for \r\nTRINCZER, the surname if his parents were not legally married.\r\n\r\nIsaak\u2019s brother, Hersch, born in Zwierzen in Lesko district, married Elke Manaster \r\nand they had 5 known children in Europe: Josef 1890; Leib 1893; Szaje 1894; Mendel \r\n1894 or 1895; and Malka 1908. Elke\u2019s brother, Harry Manaster, came to the US and headed \r\nfor Chicago. Members of Elke\u2019s family followed him there. Chaim Manaster wrote several \r\nemails outlining the family as he knew it.\r\nMalka married (Efraim) Fischel Trinczer, born 1906 in Krosno to Bacia Trinczer. They might \r\nhave been the parents of Tauba, who married Uscher Langsam. They lived in Paszowa in Lesko \r\ndistrict. Uscher and Tauba, had Freida Malka in 1934. Presumably, they perished in the Shoah.\r\nCan you add any detail to the H93 page? Know of any more siblings? Or any additional detail \r\nabout the ones listed? I am in the process of updating that page to include your grandmother \r\nand the detail you are providing. \r\n\r\nMoishe Miller\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nSubject: \tRe: The JewishGen Family Finder: mania langsam\r\nFrom: \tRandy Mahler <RMahler@carlin-group.com>\r\nDate: \tThu, May 25, 2017 2:28 pm\r\nTo: \t\"moishe.miller@totalben.com\" <moishe.miller@totalben.com>\r\n\r\nMalka is mania langsam and fishel trinczer is my grandfather;  fishel mahler.

There are more Lesko records available now. I haven't gone back to see \r\nif there is more information about the family. I have to assume that Chaim linked Isaak and \r\nHersch as brothers. I may have saved some notes, though I discarded most notes when I developed \r\nthe narrative. I simply don't have room in my small apartment for a lot of paper files.\r\n \r\nAs to why Trinczer and not Mahler, I don't know off the top of my head. \r\n \r\nSuzan\r\n\r\n==========================================================================\r\n\r\nSubject: \tRe: H24 and H93\r\nFrom: \tsrwynne@starpower.net\r\nDate: \tTue, May 30, 2017 5:05 pm\r\nTo: \tmoishe miller <moishe.miller@totalben.com>\r\nMoishe,\r\n \r\nSo, I just looked at Mahler and Trinczer in JRI and here's what I found:\r\n \r\nIn Krosno, Wolf Mahler and Basia Trinczer had an infant who died in 1901, Moses in \r\n1904 and Fischel in 1906. Wolf and Basia didn't have a civil marriage. This would \r\nexplain why Fischel was associated with both names. \r\n \r\nA different Moses Trinczer and Fradel Fischbein had Basia in 1900. A cousin perhaps \r\nto the Basia above?  \r\n \r\nAlso in Krosno: Golde Trinczer and Fischel Fischbein had three children who died \r\nyoung between 1885-1887.\r\n \r\nSuzan\r\n\r\n==========================================================================\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 7/10/2017</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
