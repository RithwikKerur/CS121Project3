I also did some sound coding.</p>\n\n<p><b>How long have you been with the group?</b> I think since April or May, whenever [EcoRaft] started.</p>\n\n<p><b>Why are you working on the project?</b> Because I want to--I thought it was interesting because I saw Bill [Tomlinson's] past work and wanted to be a part of it, and I'm glad I asked to be in it. I'm mostly working on it for experience and grad school.</p>\n\n<p><b>What do you think is the overall goal of the project?</b> To educate our subjects, or just people in general, people who experience the project and get something out of it.</p>\n\n<p><b>What was your favorite part of [or working on] the project?</b>I guess interacting with our subjects (the kids), like at Discovery Science Center. That was really cool, so I'm looking forward to do that at SIGGRAPH.</p>\n\n<p><b>What are your career goals/interests?</b> I kind of want to be in the medical field, because it seems interesting to me, but I'm also leaning towards bioinformatics.</p>\n\n<p><b>What are the other projects you've worked on?</b> [EcoRaft] is my first research project.</p>\n\n<p><b>Have you gotten any awards and/or publications?</b> Not yet.</p>\n\n<p><b>Any other questions and/or answers would you like on your site?</b> I guess that's it.</P>      \n\n\n\n\n<P>\n\n</P>\n\n\n\n\n<HR>\n\n<P><SMALL>Last updated: October 18, 2005</SMALL></P></TABLE>\n\n</BODY>\n\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
