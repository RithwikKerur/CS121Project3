Is Good. Is Excellent, Even. Not Evil. Not Bad.\n\nThis functionality (multi-document transactions) is necessary, even,\nalthough it could be implemented by separate VC operations that groups\nspecific updates together into transactions. I think that it's a\nconfiguration and not pure versioning issue, though.\n\nNote, that in the long run, we may need explicit operations to do\nmulti-document commit because commit might cross server boundaries. For\ninstance the documentation and coding groups in a complany might have\nseparate VCS, that need simple coordination. Or we can assume that\nmulti-server systems will implement any such stuff within their backends\nvia application-dependent inter-server protocols, and leave this out.\n\nI think that the multipart can be extended a bit, as we might want several\ndata types in a single modification request: eg. VTML for document updates,\nsomething new like \"versioned-gif-update\" for graphics, and maybe\n\"text/config\" or some other explicit VC operations.\n\n&gt;&gt; 2) you want to send in several updates for the same resource: e.g. I check\n&gt;&gt; out a file for the weekend on my laptop, create locally several versions --\n&gt;&gt; friday night, saturday afternoon just before the party, and sunday evening\n&gt;&gt; because I'm bored -- and check them back in first thing monday morning as a\n&gt;&gt; single connection, with the different parts representing the different\n&gt;&gt; versions that were created locally. -- This was considered an interesting\n&gt;&gt; option for VTML, and one of the main reasons for external deltas.\n&gt;\n&gt;This is nice, too. I'm not sure about the locking semantics, though.\n&gt;\nVTML can be lock-free, in which case you're not guaranteed what version\nyou'll get on check-in.\n&gt;Larry\n\n----------------------------------------------+----------------------------\n  David Durand                 <a href=\"mailto:dgd@cs.bu.edu\">dgd@cs.bu.edu</a>  | david@dynamicDiagrams.com\n  Boston University Computer Science          | Dynamic Diagrams\n  <a href=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu:80/students/grads/dgd/\">http://cs-www.bu.edu:80/students/grads/dgd/</a> | http://dynamicDiagrams.com/\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0092.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe in reply to:</b> <a href=\"0077.html\">David G.
