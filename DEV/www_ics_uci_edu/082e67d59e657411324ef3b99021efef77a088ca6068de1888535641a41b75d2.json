Let S1 be a copy of S, inscribed in L, and \nlook at the two vertices p and q of S1 that are on opposite vertical sides \nof the square.  Then p and q differ horizontally by the side of the square, \nand have Euclidean distance equal to the diagonal of S, so one can place \nanother copy S2 of S, with horizontal and vertical sides, sharing the same \ntwo vertices p and q.\n\nNow S2 is placed symmetrically in L, so it divides L into pieces in some \nproportion b:a:b, where a is the side length of S.  Thus the horizontal \nedges of S and S2 together divide the square in the proportion a:b:a:b.  In \nparticular, one of p and q is on the midpoint of its square edge.\n\nConsider the four triangles at the corners of L, cut off by the edges of \nS1.  They are similar right triangles, and the larger of the two has \nhypotenuse equal to the square's side and one side equal to half the \nsquare's side.  So they are 30-60-90 right triangles.\n\nFrom this one can calculate in turn the lengths of the remaining side of \nthe large triangle, the short side of the small triangle, and the \nhypotenuse of the small triangle, concluding that the width of S is \n(2-sqrt(3)) times the width of the square, and that the width of L is \n(1+sqrt(3)) times the width of the square.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:fc3a501@math.uni-hamburg.de\">fc3a501@math.uni-hamburg.de</A>\n<B>To:</B>             sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Reply to \"cute geometric quickie\"\n<B>Date:</B>           Sun, 17 Sep 2000 09:32:05 -0700\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nI didn't need any surds (in the inbetween computation) at all - \nhere is how I did it:\n\nFirst I generalized: Start not with a square but with a\nrectangle 1*(a+b) and cut it into 1*a and 1*b (a&lt;b).\n(So you can add questions# like \"When does the 1*a inscribe\ninto the 1*b and that in the 1*(a+b)\", which is also\ninteresting).

Together with one Pythagoras you \nimmediately get x=(b-a)/(1-a**2),y=(1-ab)/(1-a**2),\n(1-a**2)**2-(1-ab)**2=(b-a)**2. You can divide this by (a-b)\n(the \"super anal retentive degenerate case\" :-) to get\nb=a*(3-a**2)/(1+a**2). a+b=1 now gives the 2-V3 solution.\n\n# When is...one of the three rectangles similar to another...\none of them a square...b maximal...and so on :-)\n-- \nHauke Reddmann &lt;:-EX8                  BRANDNEW,IMPROVED SIG! \nSend all spam to <A HREF=\"mailto:buggeth@thee.off\">buggeth@thee.off</A>\nSend all personal e-mail to <A HREF=\"mailto:fc3a501@math.uni-hamburg.de\">fc3a501@math.uni-hamburg.de</A>\nSend all e-mail for our chemistry workgroup to <A HREF=\"mailto:fc3a501@uni-hamburg.de\">fc3a501@uni-hamburg.de</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:lew@ihgp160h200.ih.lucent.com\">lew@ihgp160h200.ih.lucent.com</A>\n<B>To:</B>             sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: cute geometric quickie\n<B>Date:</B>           Mon, 18 Sep 2000 16:28:24 -0700\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn article &lt;8ps9r0$lv5$1@cantuc.canterbury.ac.nz&gt;,\nBill Taylor &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:mathwft@math.canterbury.ac.nz\">mathwft@math.canterbury.ac.nz</A>&gt; wrote:\n&gt;<A HREF=\"mailto:fc3a501@math.uni-hamburg.de\">fc3a501@math.uni-hamburg.de</A> (Hauke Reddmann) writes:\n&gt;\n&gt;|&gt; Cut a square into two rectangles so that the\n&gt;|&gt; larger rectangle circumscribes the smaller.\n&gt;|&gt; \n&gt;|&gt; (For our anal retentives:\n&gt;\n&gt;I see you've already had one anal-retentive answer, failing to distinguish\n&gt;between  &lt;  and  &lt;= .\n&gt;\n&gt;Presumably the answer you want is to cut a sliver of a rectangle off from near \n&gt;one edge, and lay it diagonally in the remaining near-square.\n&gt;\n&gt;Seems a bit trivial for sci.math.

Then we have the equations:\n\n(C-1)*L + (S+1)*K = 0\n(S-1)*L +   C  *K = 0\n\n... and we must have C*(C-1) + ( 1 - S^2 ) = 0 = C*(2*C - 1 )\nso C= 1/2 and S = sqrt(3)/2 and K = (2-sqrt(3))*L ~= 0.268 * L\n( Passes a sanity check with paper and scissors. )\n\nLew Mammel, Jr\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           Ayatollah Potassium &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:no@spam.net\">no@spam.net</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Inscriptible Rectangles\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 20 Sep 2000 13:02:05 -0700\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nHauke Reddmann wrote:\n\n&gt; Cut a square into two rectangles so that the\n&gt; larger rectangle circumscribes the smaller.\n\nI think a non-square AxB rectangle inscribes\nin a CxD rectangle when:\n\n((C+D)/(A+B))^2 + ((C-D)/(A-B))^2 = 2\n\nand  C + D &gt; A+B.\n\n(suppose AxB is placed at an angle Theta\nto the coordinate axes, so that its projections\non the axes are of length C and D. the\nsquared expressions are sin+cos and\nsin-cos  of Theta.)\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
