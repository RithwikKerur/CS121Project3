Some have used it as a way of getting ready for \n    their Phase II oral exam by presenting their survey paper. First year grad \n    students are usually in the most difficult spot: you're just starting your \n    graduate student career, so what do you present? Probably a best answer is: \n    present a technical paper that you believe to be both interesting and significant \n    --- something you think everyone else would be interested in. If you need \n    help in identifying an appropriate paper I can make several suggestions. A \n    great place to start is the Phase II reading list:<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/software/phaseII_reading_list.html\"> \n    http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/software/phaseII_reading_list.html</a> <br>\n    <br>\n    Attendance in the seminar is mandatory (I will take attendance) and you MUST \n    make a presentation sometime during the quarter. <br>\n    <br>\n    The purpose of the first meeting (tomorrow's) is simply to set up the schedule \n    for the rest of the quarter. The class will be over by 2:25. So --- think \n    about what you'd like to present, or at a minimum, WHEN you would like to \n    make a presentation. We'll put names to dates and then we'll be done. You \n    do not have to commit to a specific topic tomorrow, just a specific date.<br>\n  </li>\n  <li>[9/25] Web site opened.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2>Schedule</h2>\n<P>Softalks meets Wednesdays, from 2:00 to 3:50 in CS 243. \n<P> 1, 2, or even 3 speakers may be scheduled for each date, depending on the \n  nature of the talks to be given. \n<P>\nThis quarters' speakers and topics (subject, as usual, to change):\n<P>\n<CENTER>\n  <TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2>\n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD><b>Date </b>\n      <STRONG>Date \n      <TD><b>Speaker(s)</b>\n      <STRONG> Speakers \n      <TD><b>Topic(s) </b>\n      <STRONG>Topics \n      <TD> <b><STRONG> Notes </STRONG> </b>\n      </strong></strong></strong>\n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> September 27\n      <TD>Course organizational meeting \n      <TD>&nbsp; \n      <TD>&nbsp; \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> October 4\n      <TD>Jie Ren\n      <TD> Using Visio as an architecture design tool\n      <TD> --- \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> October 11 \n      <TD>&nbsp; \n      <TD> --- \n      <TD>&nbsp; \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> October 18\n      <TD> Roberto Silva Filho\n      <TD>&nbsp; \n      <TD> --- \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> October 25\n      <TD> \n        <p>Roshan</p>\n        <p>Eric Dashofy</p>\n        <p>Santhoshi </p>\n      \n      <TD> --- \n      <TD>&nbsp; \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> November 1\n      <TD>\n        <p>Girish Suryanarayana </p>\n        <p>Adrita Bhor</p>\n      \n      <TD>\n        <p>Siena</p>\n        <p>P2P </p>\n      \n      <TD> --- \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> November 8\n      <TD>No meeting (1st day of FSE 2000 in San Diego)\n      <TD>&nbsp; \n      <TD> --- \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> November 15\n      <TD> \n        <p>Anita Sarma</p>\n        <p>Shreyas Doshi</p>\n        <p>Jon Hartowicz</p>\n      \n      <TD> \n        <p>TAOS: Testing with Analysis and Oracle Support </p>\n      \n      <TD>&nbsp; \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> November 22 \n      <TD>\n        <p>Jeff von Ronne </p>\n        <p>Rob Menke</p>\n      <TD>\n        <p>Safe Typed Single Static Assignment Form</p>\n        <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      \n      <TD>(Day before Thanksgiving) \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> November 29 \n      <TD> \n        <p>Cleidson De Souza</p>\n        <p>Ibrahim El-sayd</p>\n      \n      <TD> --- \n      <TD>&nbsp; \n    \n    <TR bordercolor=\"#000000\"> \n      <TD> December 6\n      <TD>No Class: Finals week\n      <TD>&nbsp; \n      <TD>&nbsp; \n    \n  </TABLE>\n</CENTER>\n<HR>\n<UL> \n</UL>\n<ADDRESS> <I>taylor@ics.uci.edu <BR>\nUpdated <!-- #BeginDate format:Am1 -->November 1, 2000<!-- #EndDate --></I></ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
