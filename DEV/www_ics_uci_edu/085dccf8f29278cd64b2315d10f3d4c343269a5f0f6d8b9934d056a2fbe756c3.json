Each pair of points is connected by the shortest great\n&gt; circle segment possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is the probability that the loop so formed goes globally round the PP?\n&gt; [i.e. that it cannot be contracted to a point.]\n\nWell this is bludgeon, but it works. Wlog take one point to be the\nnorth pole and the other two points chosen at random (uniformly wrt\nto surface area) in the northern hemisphere. The probability se\nseek is that of these two points having an angular separation of at\nleast pi/2. Let theta be the angle from the first point to the\nnorth pole. The probability that the 2nd point has a distance pi/2\nfrom the first is proportional to the area of the intersection of\nthe northern hemisphere with the hemisphere opposite the 1st point\nwhich is  2R^2 theta. The probability is of this thus theta/pi. Hence\nthe probability we seek is integral theta/pi dS over the northern\nhemisphere divided by its area. Using spherical polars this is\n(1/pi) int_0^{pi/2} theta sin theta d theta = 1/pi.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nRobin Chapman, www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~rjc/rjc.html\n\"His mind has been corrupted by colours, sounds and shapes.\"\n The League of Gentlemen\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
