What are these bloody masons\n&gt; paid to do anyway, goddammit?    Geez, what a mutant...\n\nOkay, here's my secret plan to take over the world.  Don't tell anybody.\n\nWhen I die, I want a scalene triangle of unspecified scalenity on my tombstone.\n\nThe Master Masons carving my monument will say \"Hey!  Kibo made this\neasy for us 'cause he liked us!  So we like him!  Let's give him an\nextra-special monument!\" and then they'll carve it out of solid diamond\nusing a golden chisel, the most difficult expensive combination\nother than Archimedes Plutonium's proposed solid plutonium pyramid tomb.\n\nAt sunrise on solstice morning, New Agers from around the world would\ncome to stare at the sun through my lens-shaped diamond tombstone.\nAlso, all the lettering on the tombstone would be not just incised\nso you could feel it, but flavored so you could taste it.\n\nAll this from a humble scalene triangle, the cheapest kind to make,\nunless you're using Legos.\n\nAnd speaking of scalene triangles, it bothers me that you can have a\nperfectly equilateral triangle but mathematicians have not yet agreed\non the dimensions of a perfectly scalene triangle.\n\nI was going to propose one where the sides are 1, 2, and 3 units long,\nas I think that would be a pretty cool triangle, what with side B being\ntwice side A and side C being three times A and 50% improved over B.\nAlso the angle opposite C would have over ten trijillion times as many\ndegrees (plus some radians, too) as any of the other two angles,\nwhich would be so sharp you wouldn't be able to see them before you\naccidentally tried to pick the triangle up.\n\nBut then I realized that what makes a 1:2:3 triangle so excitingly\nscalene is that two sides are much longer than one of the other sides.\nWouldn't it be even better if side C was to B as B is to A?\nTherefore, let's try 1:2:4.  Success!  The triangle is so scalene\nthat the mind of Man cannot even conceive of it!  And carrying this\nscheme to its omega we reach the pinnacle of scalenitude:\n\n           1  :  100000000  :  10000000000000000000000000000000000\n\nThe technical term for this triangle is \"the equisilly triangle\"\nbecause no one angle in it is any sillier than the whole.\n\nI have applied for a patent on the equisilly and am awaiting the\npatent office's approval and the return of my working model.\n\n&gt;     The time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.     - Bertrand Russell\n\nYay!

The proof begins with two perpindicular\nradii OA and OB in a circle centered at O.  Then locate point I on OB\nsuch that OI is 1/4 of OB.  Then locate the point E on OA such that\nangle OIE is 1/4 the angle OIA.  Then find the point F on OA\n(extended) such that EIF is half of a right angle.\n\nLet K denote the point where the circle on AF cuts OB.  Now draw a\ncircle centered at E through the point K, and let N3 and N5 denote\nthe two points where this circle strikes OA.  Then, if perpindiculars\nto OA are drawn at N3 and N5 they strike the main circle (the one\ncentered at O through A and B) at points P3 and P5.\n\nThe points A, P3, and P5 are the zeroth, third, and fifth verticies\nof a regular heptadecagon, from which the remaining verticies are\neasily found (i.e., bisect angle P3 O P5 to locate P4, etc.).\n\nOn 12 Aug 1998 <A HREF=\"mailto:mathwft@math.canterbury.ac.nz\">mathwft@math.canterbury.ac.nz</A> (Bill Taylor) wrote:\n&gt; Dunno if it was Gauss' original, I tend to doubt it.  \n\nGauss's Disquisitiones gives only the algebraic expression for the\ncosine of 2pi/17 in terms of nested square roots, i.e.,\n\n  cos(2pi/17)  =  -1/16 + 1/16 sqrt(17) + 1/16 sqrt[34 - 2sqrt(17)]\n\n + 1/8 sqrt[17 + 3sqrt(17) - sqrt(34-2sqrt(17)) - 2sqrt(34+2sqrt(17)]\n\nwhich is just the solution of three nested quadratic equations.\nInterestingly, although Gauss states in the strongest terms (all caps)\nthat his criteria for constructibility (based on Fermat primes) is\nnecessary as well as sufficient, he never published a proof of the\nnecessity, nor has any evidence of one ever been found in his papers\n(according to Buhler's biography).\n\nOn 12 Aug 1998 <A HREF=\"mailto:mathwft@math.canterbury.ac.nz\">mathwft@math.canterbury.ac.nz</A> (Bill Taylor) wrote:\n&gt; I think it was REALLY mean of the town council of Gottingen, or\n&gt; the executors of his will, or whoever, to NOT put a regular 17-gon\n&gt; on his gravestone, as he requested.
