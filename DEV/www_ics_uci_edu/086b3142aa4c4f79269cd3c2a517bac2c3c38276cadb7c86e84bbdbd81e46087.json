In\naddition, its means of display has come to incorporate <A\nHREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.02.html#1\">\nhypermedia</A> devises - such as in-line imaging, audio files, and\nselectable formats - which has made this access to knowledge even more\nengaging. With point-and-click instant access to the latest research and\ninformation throughout the world, all available through what feels more\nlike an interactive monitor than a complex computer, words such as\n\"empowering\" and \"democratizing\" have begun to surface in terms of its\naccess-ability to the non-computer-literate population. Stories have begun\nto circulate of people, disenchanted with education or society - even gang\nmembers - finding themselves drawn toward the involving nature of this new\nmedium.  As opposed to the broadcast model we have been accustomed to for\ndecades, which seems to have bred passivity, consumerism, and the\ngenerating of lowest-common-denominator programming in an attempt to reach\nthe widest audiences, a new thirst for interactive forms of \"stimulus\"\n(whether via on-line communication or virtual technologies) is emerging -\na desire to \"investigate\" beyond what is initially offered.  With people's\nability to choose the roles they wish to play, whether as consumers,\nproviders, or both, this new medium holds the promise of activism,\ndemocracy, critical thinking, and quality through competition (as long as\nit remains independent). \n\n<p>\n\nDespite these positive effects, there have been many arguments surrounding\nthe Internet and Web regarding representation, social issues,\ncommercialism, regulation/censorship, physical architecture, and power. \nWhile these issues have roused theorists in every discipline, for the \nscope of this paper, only a partially list is represented below. Further, \nas each group's insights are understandably extensive, I will  \nattempt to relay a fair assessment of their philosophy or analytical \nperspective.\n\n<p>\n\nOne group of theorists approach the Net with <A\nHREF=\"http://www.mcluhan.toronto.edu/\"> Marshall McLuhan </A>-based media\nanalysis.  McLuhan, best known for his \"The Medium is The Message\"  and <A\nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.mit.edu:3714/0D%20tiserve.mit.edu%209000%2036882%20mitpress\">\n\"Understanding Media\" </A>,wrote extensively on the nature of media and\nits social-psychological effects.  Meeting regularly in Toronto at the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.mcluhan.toronto.edu/sums/tyrie3.html\"> McLuhan Research\nCentre </A>, the group discusses the Information Hwy, from social issues\nto highly technical issues. An <A \nHREF=\"http://www.mcluhan.toronto.edu/sums/tyrie3.html\">over-view of \ntheir discussions </A> covers areas\nsuch as: \n\n<ol>\n\n<li> a front-end for the information highway\n<li> just in time learning\n<li> distance education\n<li> systematic treatment of space using retrospective <br>\n     GIS (Geographical Information Systems)\n<li> systematic treatment of time with respect to telepresence in 2-D and 3-D\n<li>integration of various tools  \n</ol>\n\nThe over-view Web site, though not heavily linked, is detailed and fairly\nsubstantial. \n\n<p>\n\nA related group is comprised of students at the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.upenn.edu/\"><B> University of Pennsylvania </B></A> who\nhave organized an experimental course called <A\nHREF=\"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mengwong/netsurf/\"><I> \"Netsurf: the\nDiscussion Seminars\"</I></A>.  The course Web site, entitled <A\nHREF=\"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mengwong/netsurf/\"> \"Social Implications\nof Information Technologies\" </A> includes topics such as:<br>\n\n<ul>\n<li> History of Media Technologies\n<li> Social Psychology of Media Effects\n<li> Current issues: copyright law and software piracy\n<li> Current issues: Privacy, Cryptography, and the Panopticon \n<li> Future Directions. \n</ul>\n\nWithin each topic are links to various documents pertaining to those\nissues. The course approaches each subject with three underlying themes:<br>\n\n<ol>\n<li><B> The Filtering Function </B> - ask: source? medium? filter? target?\"\n<li><B> Synthesis vs Analysis </B> - what is the part? what is the whole? \nhow do they relate? - do we perhaps sacrifice depth for breadth of \nknowledge?\n<li><B> Do your own research </B> - <i>Browse, search, ask</i>. Be \ncreative. \n</ol>\n\nThe course page offers a partially linked fairly extensive reading list, \nas well, ranging from Marshall McLuhan and Alvin Toffler theoretical \nbooks to <A HREF=\"http://www.wired.com/newform.html\"><i>Wired</i></A> and \nTime magazine interviews with other techno. or media-specialists. \n<br>\n<p>\n\n**There are two other very interesting articles written for <i>Wired</i> \nmagazine that are in keeping with this course.  The first is <A\nHREF=\"http://www.wired.com/Etext/1.5/features/toffler.html\"> an interview\nwith futurist Alvin Toffler </A> on his book <A\nHREF=\"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~mengwong/netsurf/contents.html#toffler1\">\n\"Shock Wave\"</A> and the other is <A\nHREF=\"http://www.wired.com/Etext/1.3/features/kapor.on.nii.html\"> a\ntheoretical essay on the Digital Highway with a Jeffersonian to\nInformation Policy</A>, which is incredibly interesting and ranges from\npolitical, to social, to technical analyses. <B>HOWEVER</B>, you must <A \nHREF=\"http://www.wired.com/newform.html\"> join<i>Wired</i> Magazine \non-line </A>, or you will be denied access to both articles. \n\n<p>\n\nThe <A HREF=\"http://www.nas.edu/\"> National Academy of Sciences </A>\ncreated the <A HREF=\"http://www.nas.edu/1/nap\"><i>National Academy\nPress</i></A> to publish reports issued by the National Academy of\nSciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine,\nand the National Research Council.  <A\nHREF=\"http://xerxes.nas.edu:70/1/nap/online/rtif\">\"Realizing the\nInformation Future: The Internet and Beyond\"</A> is one of NAP's\npublications discussing the lastest issues concerning the National\nInformation Infrastructure (NII). Areas of discussion include defining the\npurpose of the NII, social and economic implications, funding\narrangements, management responsibilities, increasing commercial service,\ntechnical issues, and choosing an appropriate physical infrastructure.\nTopics overlap some of those on the<A\nHREF=\"http://www.ibm.com/Sponsor/g7live/G7live.html\"> G7 Live Home\nPage</A> (Group of Seven Conference Coverage) - another unbelievable site\nwith the latest discussions regarding the \"Information Superhwy\". \n\n<p>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.pff.org/\">The Progress and Freedom Foundation</A> is a\nRepublican based organization who, while striving to be analytical in its\nvarious publications, is nevertheless, strictly pro-progress - \"an\norganization whose aim is to create a positive vision of the future\". \nWith its board of directors' and fellows' backgrounds lying in economics,\npolitics, military, and foreign affairs many of their projects carry\neconomic and political overtones such as their <A\nHREF=\"http://www.pff.org/position.html\">Magna Carta for the Knowledge\nAge\"</A> referred to often by House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA).  Their\napproach to the new medium, then, focuses mainly on public policy and\ninformation technology. \n\n<p>\n\nFor more related references:<br>\n<ul> \n\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.rpi.edu/~decemj/study/cmc/what.html\">http://www.rpi.edu/~decemj\n/study/cmc/what.html</A><BR>\n\"What is Computer-Mediated Communication?\" is a definition offered by John\nDecember for Computer-Mediated Communication Magazine (of which December\nis also editor and publisher\n- -http://www.rpi.edu/~decemj/cmc/mag/masthead.html - another great site)\nwhich not only defines the concept but also enumerates various types of   \nstudies done on the topic from within each discipline - including social,\ncognitive/psychological, linguistic, cultural, technical, and political\naspects or drawn from such fields as human communication, rhetoric, \ncomposition, media studies, human-computer interaction, journalism,\ntelecommunications, computer science, technical communication, or\ninformation studies.  What's amazing about this site is that he provides\nlinks to each discipline's theories, some with web pages and some with\nmainpoint listings of various theorists' articles.
