For instance,<P>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>A ban on newsgroup posts that express bigoted viewpoints would be unconstitutional: Reprehensible as bigoted ideas are, they are constitutionally protected.<BR>\r\n<LI>A ban on Web pages that discuss abortion would be unconstitutional.  This is so even though the ban applies to all views (both pro and anti) on abortion.  Even such \"viewpoint- neutral\" regulations are presumptively unconstitutional, so long as they are *content*-based.<BR>\r\n</UL>\r\nAnd this is true regardless of whether the restriction is enforced through *criminal punishment* or through *civil liability*.  A law that lets people sue for emotional harm inflicted by bigoted Web sites would be as unconstitutional as a law imposing criminal punishment on people who put up such sites.<P>\r\nIf the restriction is content-neutral -- for instance, a tax of 1/100 of a cent per 1000 bytes of e- mail sent, or a ban on any person sending more than 100 unsolicited e-mail messages a day -- it's probably constitutional, even though it does in some way restrict speech.<P>\r\nCommon MYTH:  \"Content-based speech restrictions are OK if they only restrict the time, place, or manner of speech.\" No; if a restriction is content-based, it's presumptively unconstitutional, even if it lets you express your views some other way or in some other place or at some other time. Thus, a law banning profanity on all newsgroups is unconstitutional even though it only restricts the \"manner\" and \"place\" of expression and doesn't itself ban any ideas.<P>\r\n<P>authors:\r\n<TABLE CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>\r\n<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Larry Lessig</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>David Post</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Eugene Volokh</TD></TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<BR>\r\n<CENTER>\r\n<HR SIZE=\"3\" WIDTH=\"65%\">\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"../csl_lessons.html\">Back to Lesson Index</A>\r\n</CENTER>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\">\r\nCopyright \u00a9 1999 Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc.
