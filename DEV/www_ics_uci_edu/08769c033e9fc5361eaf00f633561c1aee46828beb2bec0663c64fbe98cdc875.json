Isaacson, Corporate Architect, Novell Inc.\n</h3>\n<p>\nThe Printer Working Group (PWG) and the IETF-chartered Internet Printing\nProtocol (IPP) working group are working to define the event notification\noperations and semantics associated with Internet printing.  This presentation \ngives the back ground and context for this work and how it relates to network \nprinters and distributed printing systems in general.  Proposed requirements \nand solutions are discussed.  The proposals address issues relating to roles, \nterminology, internationalization, print job requests with notification \nsubscriptions, security and quality of service parameters, event reports and \nformats, mutliple delivery methods, and the types of printing-related events \nand their groupings.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
