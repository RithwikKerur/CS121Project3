There is really only one parameter left\n    to optimize, the angle of the triangle -- you can grow triangles\n    with a given angle until they touch each other, giving a function\n    f(theta) which is the largest square-lattice-packing of equilateral\n    triangles at angle theta.  Actually this is defined only mod 30 degrees.\n    It seems from inspection that [in the range 0 <U>&lt;</U> theta <U>&lt;</U> 30]\n    f(theta) has a unique maximum, at 15 degrees.\n\nI now have a nice non-mechanical proof of this.\n\nGiven an angle theta, I want to describe how to compute f(theta)\nas defined above.  Let point A=(0,0), B=(0,1) C=(1,0)\n[I'm a computational geometer, I use coordinates.\nEverything here can be done in compass &amp; straightedge but who cares.]\nDraw lines L1 through A at angle theta, L2 through A at angle theta+60,\nL3 through B at angle theta, L4 through C at angle theta+60.\nLet D = intersection(L2,L3) and E = intersection(L1,L4).\nThen f(theta) = min { distance(A,D), distance(A,E) }.\n[You also have to worry about your triangle covering point (1,1)\nbut that turns out not to be a problem.]\n\nSo what does f(theta) look like and where is its maximum?\nLet's look at distance(A,D).  As theta varies from\n0 to 30, angle BDA stays fixed at 60 degrees.\nTherefore D traces out a curve of constant angle, namely a circle \nin which AB forms a 120-degree chord.  From this we can see\nthat distance(AD) increases monotonically as theta increases from 0 to 30.\nSymmetrically distance(AE) decreases monotonically.\nSince neither distance has a local maximum in this range,\nthe maximum of f(theta) occurs where the two are equal,\nwhich by symmetry is at theta=15 degrees.\n\nQED...\n\nI still haven't computed the size of the triangle at that angle,\nbut it's a simple question of trigonometry:\nwhat's the ratio of hypotenuse to middle side in a 15-60-105 triangle?\n--\nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 13 Jun 97 07:30:20 jst\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:Pat_Ballew_at_~~MISA-FHS@ccmail.pac.odedodea.edu\">Pat_Ballew_at_~~MISA-FHS@ccmail.pac.odedodea.edu</A>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        equilateral triangles and \"Geometry Junkyard\"\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n     Mr David Eppstein,\n     \n        I stumbled across your \"Geometry Junkyard\" and was very pleased to \n     find such a wealth of great questions and ideas.  I was even more \n     surprised that you had addressed a problem (equilateral triangle \n     question by Dan Asimov) to which I had made a conjecture.  Your note \n     on the web page indicates that your solution of a triangle with sides \n     of 2 units corrects a previous attempt.  I assume this refers to my \n     post of 10/26/95 indicating appx 2.15 as a solution.  I did, however, \n     follow up on 10/29/95 with a second statement that improved the \n     original guess with a general conjecture about ALL triangles, not just \n     equilateral triangles, and in fact I made a conjecture about *any* \n     convex polygon, which I now realize was *very* wrong.  \n        Because I almost never have the opportunity to discuss these kinds \n     of problems with people of your experience, I would love to have you \n     address the general conjecture I made about a triangle that contains a \n     unit square  in the 10/29/95 post.  That would include your solution, \n     and generalize somewhat, I think.  Is it correct in either of the two \n     parts.  \n        Thanks again for the great source of problems.\n     \n     Pat Ballew,\n     Misawa, Japan\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</A>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:Pat_Ballew_at_~~MISA-FHS@ccmail.pac.odedodea.edu\">Pat_Ballew_at_~~MISA-FHS@ccmail.pac.odedodea.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        ...continued\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 13 Jun 1997 10:57:42 -0700\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nA 45-45-90 triangle with hypotenuse length 3-epsilon contains\na square of side length 3/2sqrt2 ~ 1.06, larger than a unit square;\nbut this triangle can still be placed to avoid all integer points.\nI think this is the maximum possible size for a square contained in a\ntriangle that avoids the integer points, but have no proof.\n\nI think the other part of your conjecture, that a triangle that doesn't\ncontain a unit square can avoid all integer points, is true.\nJust place the triangle with one side along the x axis (y=0).\nSince it doesn't contain the unit square, it in particular doesn't\ncontain a unit square aligned with the coordinate axes in this placement,\nand therefore there is enough room for its top corner to poke between\nthe integer points on the line y=1.\n\nWould you mind if I include your correspondence in my web site?\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Mon, 16 Jun 97 09:31:20 jst\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:Pat_Ballew_at_~~MISA-FHS@ccmail.pac.odedodea.edu\">Pat_Ballew_at_~~MISA-FHS@ccmail.pac.odedodea.edu</A>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: ...continued\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n     Mr Eppstein,\n        Thank you for the response.
