Prices allow people to see the\ncosts associated with their actions.  In the case of purchasing a good,\nprices allow an individual to make a rational decision about the value of\nthe good.  When prices correctly reflect the costs associated with an\naction, then the individual can weigh the costs and benefits of their\naction and make a decision on whether to pursue the action. Presumably if\nthe benefits outweigh the costs, then the individual should purchase the\ngood.  In this case, the good that I am referring to is the resources that\nare available on the <i>Internet</i> and <i>World Wide Web</i> (WWW). \nAlthough there are currently prices for using the Internet, the prices are\nbased on monthly subscription fees and one time connection fees.  These\ncosts are relatively low, and they do not distinguish between the value an\nindividual has for a prompt connection or for one that is delayed. There \nis no mechanism that\nreflects the costs to other individuals brought on by a person making a\nconnection to a server.  This inevitably leads to congestion.  Gupta, \nStahl, and Whinston in their paper <a href = \n\"http://cism.bus.utexas.edu/ravi/pricing.ps.Z\"><b><i>Managing the Internet \nas an Economic System</i></b></A> said, \"The Internet is already \nexperiencing traffic jams and, given the growth rate...this will become a \nsevere problem if coordinating mechanisms are not designed and \nimplemented.\" I will argue\nthat it is necessary to begin attaching prices to services in order to\nrelieve the congestion that is greatly increasing on the WWW.  The goal of\nmy paper is to provide a foundation for the understanding of how prices\nmay allow the information available on the Internet to be accessed and\nretrieved more efficiently. <p>\n \n<h3> Social Costs</h3>   \n\nCongestion occurs on the Internet because of too much traffic by\nindividuals on the routers and lines of the Internet.  Since there is no\npricing mechanism except for the monthly subscription fee, there is no\nincentive for individuals to reduce their traffic on the Internet. \nBecause the Internet is basically a public good with no costs to\nindividuals associated with the amount of bandwidth they use, individuals\ntypically use more services then they otherwise may have. Over-usage\ncreates externalities on other individuals whose connection and\ntransmission may be delayed <A\nHREF=\"http://edgar.stern.nyu.edu/network/top.html\"><b><i>(Economides)</B></i></a>. \nThis problem can be illustrated by the 'Tragedy of the Commons'.  During\nthe Middle Ages, villagers shared plots of land called the commons, where\neveryone could take their sheep to graze.  Since there was no mechanism to\ncontrol the amount of grazing, every individual villager had an incentive\nto take all of their sheep to graze.  This led to an overgrazing of the\nland.  In the case of the Internet and WWW, the lack of a pricing\nmechanism leads to a similar problem.  If I value the information from a\nserver more than Lynn, then I should be able to convey this to the server\nand receive the information.  Prices would enable individuals to measure\ntheir preferences for the information available. By attaching prices to\nthe connections of individuals to various servers, WWW users would have a\ngreater incentive to only connect and retrieve information that will be\nhave benefits that are greater then the costs. Prices would provide a\nmechanism to ensure that the marginal users do not receive the service\nbefore users who value it more. <p>\n\n<h3> Pricing Mechanisms</h3>\n\nI believe the most efficient pricing mechanism, with the lowest social\ncosts, will differentiate between peak usage periods and low usage\nperiods.  The majority of the costs associated with WWW usage is in the\nfixed costs to provide the connections and the backbone.  Once the lines\nand routers are in place, the marginal costs of an additional user are\nnegligible as long as there is available bandwidth.  For this reason it\nwould be unreasonable to charge people during non-peak hours, since the\nmarginal costs are so low.  MacKie-Mason and Varian, in their paper titled\n<A\nHREF=\"ftp://gopher.econ.lsa.umich.edu/pub/Papers/Pricing_the_Internet.ps.Z\"><b><i>Pricing\nthe Internet</i></b></a> called these 'smart markets'.  Smart markets\nwould charge people during peak periods.  The people who would be willing\nto pay the most, those who gained the highest utility from a connection,\nwould be the ones who would be allowed to utilize the information\navailable on the server. <p>\n There could also be a mechanism that allows people to give a priority to\ntheir transmission, during peak periods.  Those who give a low priority to\ntheir transmission would only be charged a minimal fee, but likewise would\nnot receive prompt connection.  The server would only connect when it\nwould not interfere with an other individuals' connection <A\nHREF=\"ftp://gopher.econ.lsa.umich.edu/pub/Papers/Pricing_the_Internet.ps.Z\"><b><i>(Mackie-Mason\nand Varian)</b></i></a>. As mentioned earlier, the services during \nnon-peak periods would be very cheap, if not free.<p>\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\nAlthough the value of prices for the services on the Internet are\napparent, there is a problem.  Currently there is no accounting mechanism\nto monitor and collect the fees that are related to usage.  This is\nbecause the transmissions over the Internet are done in packets of data <A\nHREF=\"http://far.mit.edu/Pubs/inet_econ/abstract.html\"><b><i> \n(Bailey)</B></I></A>. \nIt would not be efficient to charge individuals for their total log on\ntime to a server since most of the time they are not actually transmitting\ndata.  Therefore, a mechanism to monitor and then collect the fees would\nneed to be established.  Perhaps a system can emerge that charges users on\nthe amount of information that is carried within packets and at the time\nof the transmission (peak vs. non-peak).<p>\n\nI believe that at the rate of growth on the WWW and Internet, congestion\nwill become more of a problem in the near future.  A mechanism has to be\nestablished that will aid in the efficient transfer of information of the\nInternet lines.  I feel that by implementing a market driven price\nstructure, as mentioned above, that congestion would be greatly reduced\nover the WWW.  The benefits of the information available on the WWW and\nInternet are clear <a\nHREF=\"http://www.ibm.com/Sponsor/g7live/30019.html\"><b><i>(Gaunt)</b></I></a>.\nHowever, the information that is available on the Internet and WWW is only\nvaluable if it is able to be obtained, and in an efficient manner, by the\nindividuals who value it the most.  I think prices will help in achieving\nan efficiency in the retrieval of the resources available on the\nInternet.<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>Other Related Articles</h4>\n\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/net-research/policy.ps.Z\"><B><I>Shenker</B></I></A>\n\n<LI><A \nhref=\"http://alfred.econ.lsa.umich.edu/EconInternet/Pricing.html><b><i>Usage based pricing</b></i></A>\n\n\n\n</body>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
