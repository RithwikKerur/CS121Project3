Thus, the previous study\nquestions for \n<a href=\"midterm1.html\">Midterm 1</a> and\n<a href=\"midterm2.html\">Midterm 2</a> also apply to the final exam.\n\n<p>\nIn addition to the readings and previous homeworks, listed on the \n<a href=\"index.html\">CS 162 Homework page</a>,\nand the previous study questions,\nsolving the following questions will provide a good preparation\nfor the final exam.\n\n<ol>\n<li> Problem 5.3 from Sipser. </li>\n<li> Problem 5.6 from Sipser. </li>\n<li> Problem 5.7 from Sipser. </li>\n<li> Problem 5.10 from Sipser. </li>\n<li> Problem 5.11 from Sipser. </li>\n<li> Exercise 7.5 in Sipser               </li>\n<li> Exercise 7.6 in Sipser               </li>\n<li> Exercise 7.7 in Sipser               </li>\n<li> Exercise 7.12 in Sipser               </li>\n<li> Exercise 7.23 in Sipser               </li>\n<li>\nDefine SUBGRAPH-ISOMORPHISM as the problem that takes a graph, G, and\nanother graph, H, and determines if H is isomorphic to a subgraph of G. That\nis, the problem is to determine whether there is a one-to-one mapping, f, of the\nvertices in H to a subset of the vertices in G such that, if (v,w) is an edge in\nH, then (f(v), f(w)) is an edge in G. Show that SUBGRAPH-ISOMORPHISM is\nNP-complete.\n<li>\nDefine INDEPENDENT-SET as the problem that takes a graph G and an integer k\nand asks whether G contains an independent set of vertices of size k. That is, G\ncontains a set I of vertices of size k such that, for any v and w in I, there is no\nedge (v,w) in G. Show that INDEPENDENT-SET is NP-complete.\n<li>\nDefine HYPER-COMMUNITY to be the problem that takes a collection of n web\npages and an integer k, and determines if there are k web pages that all contain\nhyperlinks to each other. Show that HYPER-COMMUNITY is NP-complete.\n<li> Exercise 8.4 in Sipser               </li>\n</ol>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
