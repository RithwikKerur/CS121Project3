The game is a draw.\n\nAs there are different variations of NMM being played, I will first specify\nthe rules I used, then give a short summary of how the solution was computed.\n\nRULES\n-----\n\nNine Men's Morris is played on a board with 24 points where stones may be\nplaced.\n\n+--------+--------+\n|        |        |\n|  +-----+-----+  |\n|  |     |     |  |\n|  |  +--+--+  |  |\n|  |  |     |  |  |\n+--+--+     +--+--+\n|  |  |     |  |  |\n|  |  +--+--+  |  |\n|  |     |     |  |\n|  +-----+-----+  |\n|        |        |\n+--------+--------+\n\nBoth players start with nine stones each.\n\nThe game goes through three phases\n        -  opening phase\n           Players alternately place stones on an empty point.\n        -  midgame phase\n           After all stones are placed, players slide stones to\n           any adjacent vacant point.\n        -  endgame phase\n           When a player has only three stones left, she may\n           jump a stone to any vacant point.\n\nWhen closing a mill (three-in-a-row), any opponent's stone\nwhich is not part of a mill may be removed. If all the\nopponent's stones are part of mills, any stone may be removed.\n\nClosing two mills simultaneously (opening phase) only allows\none of the opponent's stones to be removed.\n\n        -  The first player who has less than three stones loses.\n        -  The first player who cannot make a legal move loses.\n\nHOW IT WAS SOLVED\n-----------------\n\nRetrograde Analysis (well known from Chess) was used to compute\ndatabases for all mid- and endgame positions (about 10 billion\ndifferent positions). These positions were split into 28\nseparate databases characterized by the number of stones on the\nboard i.e. all the 3 White stone against 3 Black stone\npositions, the 4-3, 4-4 ... up to 9-9 positions.\n \nAn 18 ply alpha-beta search for the opening phase then found\nthe value of the initial position (the empty board). Only the\n9-9, 9-8 and 8-8 databases were needed to establish that the\ngame is a draw.\n\nRalph Gasser (<a href=\n\"mailto:gasser@inf.ethz.ch\">gasser@inf.ethz.ch</a>)\nInformatik, ETH\nCH-8092 Zurich\nSwitzerland\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     rec.games.abstract\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:gasser@inf.ethz.ch\">gasser@inf.ethz.ch</a> (Ralph Gasser)\n<b>Subject:</b>        Nine Men's Morris: More about the draw\n<b>Organization:</b>   Dept.

Note that since the proof\nwas obtained using only the 9-9, 9-8 and 8-8 databases, neither\nplayer need close more than one mill to reach a draw ,thereby\navoiding a loss with less than three stones.\n\n- What is an optimal opening strategy (for humans)?\n\nI must admit that I have not examined the opening moves\nfor any easily describable patterns. \nHowever, the examination of mid- and endgame databases\nhas repeatedly shown optimal play to be beyond human\ncomprehension. Therefore, I very much doubt that any such\nsimple-to-describe strategy exists. \n\n- Is a paper describing these results available?\n\nI am now working on such a paper. I will send a copy to those\nof you who have requested one as soon as it is completed.\n\nThere is however a paper describing some initial results\nof the retrograde analysis phase of the project:\n\nGasser, R., \"Applying Retrograde Analysis to Nine Men's \nMorris\", Heuristic Programming in Artificial\nIntelligence 2: the Second Computer Olympiad, Levy, D.N.L.\nand Beal, D.F. (Eds.), pp. 161-173, Ellis Horwood, London.\n\n- Is the program available?\n\nMaking the program available is something of a problem \nbecause of the databases it uses. In total the databases \namount to a few hundred MBytes.\n\nThere is of course a program available which plays without\nany database (or with a few small db's). While this program\ncannot claim to be invincible, it plays quite strongly, having\nwon a match against the British Champion.\n\nThis program was developed under the Smart Game Board and \ntherefore only runs on Macintosh computers. The program\nis shareware and depending on the number of requests, I will\neither make it available via ftp or snail mail.\n\nRalph Gasser (<a href=\n\"mailto:gasser@inf.ethz.ch\">gasser@inf.ethz.ch</a>)\nInformatik, ETH\nCH-8092 Zurich\nSwitzerland\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     rec.games.abstract\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:colley@qucis.queensu.ca\">colley@qucis.queensu.ca</a> (Paul Colley)\n<b>Subject:</b>        Re: Nine Men's Morris: More about the draw\n<b>Organization:</b>   Computing &amp; Information Science, Queen's University at Kingston\n<b>Date:</b>           Wed, 24 Nov 1993 15:41:54 GMT\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nIn article &lt;1993Nov24.103138.21488@neptune.inf.ethz.ch&gt;\n<a href=\n\"mailto:gasser@inf.ethz.ch\">gasser@inf.ethz.ch</a> (Ralph Gasser) writes:\n\n&gt;A draw is reached through cyclical play, whereby neither\n&gt;player can (or will) close a mill.

Er, let me rephrase that.  \"The evidence\nsupplied does not prove your conclusion.\"\n\nIn building the 9-9 and 9-8 databases, you would have used the smaller\ndata bases.  Retrograde analysis starts from the smallest, and works\nup.\n\nSay some position in the 8-7 database is a draw.  Then in the 8-8\ndatabase, a position where the player may close a mill and reduce to\nthe drawn 8-7 position gets marked as a draw (assuming there's no\nwinning move).\n\nYou don't need the 8-7 database in doing the opening search, because\nyou don't need to know why the particular 8-8 position is drawn.  This\nis NOT the same thing as\n\n&gt;neither player need close more than one mill to reach a draw\n\nThe fact that you didn't need the smaller databases in the opening\nsearch just means that no player need close more than one mill *DURING\nTHE OPENING* to reach a draw.  It doesn't mean the player doesn't need\nto close a mill during the middle or end game.\n\nThe correct statement, based on the evidence you give, is \"neither\nplayer need close more than one mill, and only during the opening, to\nreach a book draw.\"  Well, now that the initial position of NMM is\nsolved, we could even say \"neither player needs to make a move to reach\na book draw.\"  Of course, if your opponent doesn't agree, you still\nhave to play out the book draw, and that (may) require the smaller\ndatabases.  Or may not require the smaller databases.  I have nothing\nto contradict your statement.  I'm just asking for more support.\n\n- Paul Colley\nUniversity:  <a href=\n\"mailto:colley@qucis.queensu.ca\">colley@qucis.queensu.ca</a>\nHome:        <a href=\n\"mailto:pacolley@ember.uucp\">pacolley@ember.uucp</a>   watmath!ember!pacolley  +1 613 545 3807\n\"Anyone who attempts to generate random numbers by deterministic means is,\nof course, living in a state of sin.\"  - John von Neumann\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
