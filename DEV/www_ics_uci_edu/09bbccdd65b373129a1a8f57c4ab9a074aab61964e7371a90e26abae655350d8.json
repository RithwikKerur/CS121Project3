Katz, and Joseph Mitchell,\n<i>SCG&nbsp;2004</i>.\n\n<p>\nAbstract: The authors study the problem of computing the visibility\ngraph defined by a set <i>P</i> of <i>n</i> points inside a polygon\n<i>Q</i>: two points <i>p,q</i> in <i>P</i> are joined by an edge if\nthe segment <i>pq</i> is contained in <i>Q</i>.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2>Kevin Wortman</br>\nOn finding a guard that sees most and a shop that sells most</br>\n</h2>\n\n<p>This is a presentation of the paper\n\"On Finding a Guard That Sees Most and a Shop That Sells Most,\"\nby Otfried Cheong, Alon Efrat, and Sariel Har-Peled,\n<i>Proceedings of the Fifteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete\nAlgorithms</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Abstract: We present a near-quadratic time algorithm that computes\na point inside a simple polygon <i>P</i> having approximately the\nlargest visibility polygon inside <i>P</i>, and near-linear time\nalgorithm for finding the point that will have approximately the\nlargest Voronoi region when added to an <i>n</i>-point set. We apply\nthe same technique to find the translation that approximately\nmaximizes the area of intersection of two polygonal regions in\nnear-quadratic time.\n\n<p>Due to time constraints I will be focusing on a few select results of\nthe paper.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
