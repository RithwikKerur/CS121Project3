In the\ninterest of privacy, attributes that clearly identify individuals,\nsuch as name and Social Security number, are removed.  Nevertheless,\nit has been shown that such de-identified tables can often be used to\nuniquely identify individuals using a combination of attributes such\nas gender, zipcode, and date of birth.\n<p>\nProposed methods for preventing this type of privacy breech give rise\nto many interesting theoretical problems.  This talk will survey some\nof these  privacy-preserving techniques, with an emphasis on the\nalgorithms and analysis that they require.  This will include some\nknown results as well as several open problems.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
