'04 is hoping to tap a diverse mix of talented UCI grads to help him expand his location-based networking app Locye.\r\n\r\n\r\n</I></B><P>\r\n                <p>\r\n\r\n<IMG SRC='/bin/img/features/Sajjad-Mustehsan-Profile.jpg' STYLE='width: 100%; '>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>\r\nSajjad Mustehsan (B.S. \u201904) jokes he\u2019s been programming since he was 9 years old. Perhaps that\u2019s why he\u2019s amassed such a wealth of experience in software engineering, pursuing a master\u2019s degree in the subject at <A HREF=\"http://www.cmu.edu/\">Carnegie Mellon University</A> and working for companies like Adobe-owned Omniture and Esri, the biggest geographic information systems (GIS) company in the world. Still, Mustehsan counts among his most proud accomplishments the entrepreneurial projects he\u2019s spearheaded on his own. His latest: location-based social networking app \r\n<A HREF=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.locye.android\">Locye</A>, a project inspired by a visit to UC Irvine.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\nLocye uses a sophisticated mapping technology to share (personal or anonymous) posts with fellow local users. The definition of \u201clocal\u201d changes depending on the density of users, thanks to Mustehsan\u2019s smart technology. For example, a user in a classroom full of users will see posts from that class only. If local users are sparse, the app will automatically widen its range. The app is a culmination of skills from his life\u2019s work, Mustehsan says. With more than 1,000 users gained in about a month, he\u2019s happy to see Locye\u2019s fast-growing appeal. He hopes soon to expand the project to employ ICS grads here in Irvine. Learn more about Locye and Mustehsan\u2019s multifaceted career path below.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>What drew you to computer science and software engineering?</B> <BR>\r\nI started programming when I was 9 years old on a Windows 3.1 PC 386 in 1992 or \u201993. I had been making small things here and there and then webpages and the Internet came, so I was inclined to build things. I realized computer science would be my area of expertise. When I came to UCI, I was thinking I\u2019d pursue programming. I thought programming was everything: You come in and write XYZ and that\u2019s it. When I studied at ICS, I had the chance to take a software engineering course with Professor Andre van der Hoek. That\u2019s when I realized there was more to computer science than programming. It was all about designing and taking big problems and breaking them into smaller pieces and building software systems. That\u2019s why I took the software systems specialization then. I realized it was software engineering that I really liked, which is why I did my master\u2019s in software engineering.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>What did you do after graduating from Carnegie Mellon?</B> <BR>\r\nRight after I completed my master\u2019s degree, I started working for a company called Omniture, which is now part of Adobe. I worked there for more than half a year, and then I moved to Esri, the largest GIS company in the world. I worked in their Washington, D.C., office, mostly on federal and civilian commercial projects, serving U.S. government agencies and large Fortune 500 companies. I did GIS work\u2014using data to create maps and analyze maps with software to identify where customers live for advertising or where to place new stores\u2014so store site selection, business continuity, things like that. For example, if a disaster happens, how can a business stay open or what items would they need to provide?\r\n \r\n<P>\r\nIn 2011, I realized there was some opportunity in taking GIS as a very complex system and making it something small businesses could use as an integrated system. For example, a large company has large systems\u2014a point of sale system, a margin system\u2014and they use several custom software systems to convert that data and use it as a GIS dataset, and analyze that dataset and use it to produce maps and more. What I wanted to build as part of a project called Exachain was a single product that combined all those systems on a smaller scale for small businesses so that they have the same power and data analytics that big companies have, so that they can compete.\r\n\r\n<P>\r\nThat didn\u2019t really take off. Part of the reason was I was a one-person team and I didn\u2019t realize that building is one thing, but selling a product is a big challenge. One of my professors at Carnegie Mellon told me \u2018I know you can make the product, but the problem is, do you have the resources to go and sell it? Small businesses are more difficult to get money out of than large companies.\u2019 In the venture capital business, you need to have proof of concept or existing sales ... it doesn\u2019t matter how good the project is, they want to see real revenue sources. I didn\u2019t have the resources to sell it, because I was bootstrapping it from my own savings.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\nI had to come up with smaller projects that would be less risky, so I suspended the project, which currently has more than 300,000 lines of code. As a smaller project, I came up with Locye.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>What's the story behind Locye?</B><BR>\r\nI did a project in Irvine before Locye called JunkLo. I had a relative who was a junk dealer\u2014you know how people have lots of junk stowed away in their garage. JunkLo was a kind of Craigslist platform for those people. That didn\u2019t take off either. ... I realized a better project would be a social platform, where I didn\u2019t have to rely on any single person because every person is a potential user. So if I could come up with something that used my GIS experience and everything I\u2019d done so far and funnel it into a single project, I could gain more traction. Plus, there\u2019s the cost of marketing in the U.S., which is pretty high ... but if your product has a global appeal, it can be more affordable to advertise elsewhere and raise funds to capture the U.S. market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<IMG SRC='/bin/img/features/Locye-screen-capture.jpg' STYLE='margin: 1em auto; '>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>Have you done test runs of Locye outside of the U.S.?</B><BR>\r\nWe got the first version out in July and started marketing in August 2015. We have over 1,000 users in Pakistan, a place where English is not the first language (Locye\u2019s user interface is in English); where the education level is not as high as in the U.S.; and the connectivity, Internet bandwidth and infrastructure are not as high as in the U.S. Despite this, with every ad we\u2019ve put up so far, our cost of acquiring each user has been less than a dollar. Every ad has received a tremendous response. We have a fast-growing user base and I think we\u2019ve done pretty well with bootstrapping resources.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>Give us the premise behind Locye.</B><BR>\r\nI\u2019ve been a longtime user of social networks. A young person, especially a student, has a few hundred friends\u2014sometimes thousands\u2014on these networks. As time goes by, you realize most of those people are only acquaintances. Most people only have 10 or so close friends\u2014but there\u2019s also a world beyond these friends. If you\u2019re looking to share something, or get broad feedback, or give feedback, there\u2019s a whole world beyond friends.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\nFor example, there\u2019s 30,000-plus students at UCI. Each of these students have a few hundred friends on a typical social network, but what about the remaining 28,000 students? With Locye, the system uses the GPS on your phone to determine your location and other users\u2019 locations, and based on where you are and whom you are with, it will share messages with the people around you. Locye is smart: It can detect when you are with people. Say, if you\u2019re in a class of 30 people, Locye will know to share with the people closest to you in the class. When you\u2019re not around people, it\u2019s smart enough to go outside as far as Anaheim. ... We also have selective anonymity. You can share things as yourself, or anonymously. ... Still, in our terms of use and otherwise, we want people to be responsible with their content. We want to encourage freedom of expression, but responsibly. There are other apps with anonymity only and they have been abused. With Locye, anonymity does not mean abuse or bullying; we take that very seriously.\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>It seems like it would be handy in really bad traffic, and other situations where you\u2019d want to notify the public.</B> <BR>\r\nYeah. Locye is not the only GPS location-based app out there, but we are the only app of our kind. Since we\u2019re using fairly sophisticated GIS technology, it\u2019s smart enough to detect when you\u2019re in moving environments. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re driving from UCI to Los Angeles and you\u2019re passing by South Coast Plaza. In typical GPS-based applications, it will detect that you\u2019re close to South Coast Plaza and give you the option to tag yourself there. When you\u2019re closer to Long Beach Airport, you will be able to tag yourself there, too. But what if there\u2019s no nearby landmark, like on the drive through the desert to Las Vegas? The nearest thing you can tag is probably 50 miles off, which is not accurate. With Locye, we use a sophisticated map that determines exactly where you are and will automatically use your location as the tag itself. It will be the same for other users, so you\u2019ll be able to see who is near. The definition of near will change, depending on the density of users around you.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>How big is the Locye team?</B><BR>\r\nOfficially, there are three people, but it\u2019s really just one engineer and two assistants. For non-technical things, we\u2019re going to need a lot of people. We\u2019re going to need a lot of engineers because we have a long line of features planned and this is just the beginning. We still have to come on other platforms, add features and capture the market.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>Is it true that a visit to UCI inspired you to create Locye?</B><BR>\r\nWhenever I was in Irvine, for business or otherwise, I would visit the campus once every two or three months. I realized there were so many people here, and I could see that everyone was using some form of social communication. I could see students coming out of Mesa Court, where I used to live, and typing something. Back when I was in college, 10 or 11 years ago, cell phones were still rare. There were no apps, no iOS, no Android, not even Blackberry. I realized there is so much around them that these students are missing. They could meet new people and share ideas freely\u2014and there are situations where you might want to share things without being connected to your identity, or share things with new people and get their perspective. So that\u2019s when I realized I should go and build something for these students with the technology I\u2019ve been working on. This is a little bit of Exachain, JunkLo and everything I\u2019ve done before. It\u2019s a social system inspired by students and intended for them, but the application can go beyond students. Still, it\u2019s a good starting point.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>This app could be useful in advertising, too.</B><BR>\r\nYeah. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s an event\u2014someone is coming to campus and you want to get the word out to students. One way would to be put an ad on a system that targets UCI undergrads, but that would cost a lot of money. In the market where we currently operate, South Asia, we use one of the conventional social networks to advertise. However, people don\u2019t always put in accurate information\u2014their ages are wrong, their locations are wrong, their schools are wrong. This is less of a problem in the U.S., but in developing countries it\u2019s a bad situation\u2014the accuracy is way off. This makes it difficult to target your ads and get your message to the right people. You\u2019re paying to get your message to people you didn\u2019t intend. With Locye, since it\u2019s location-based, one thing you can do immediately is share the post on campus or within however many miles you choose. The feedback you receive will show you the commenter\u2019s distance.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>Are you planning on basing the company in Irvine?</B><BR>\r\nYes, I love Irvine. I\u2019ve lived in the Silicon Valley, Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh. I think there\u2019s a lot of untapped potential on this campus. It\u2019s a Top 30 computer science school and I personally think it\u2019s better than Top 30. I think the workforce being produced here is really strong technically and in terms of motivation and dedication. Irvine is a great place, too. ... It would be great if there was a way to harness all this potential, keep it in Irvine, and pay these grads as well as Silicon Valley with all the benefits of Irvine\u2014it\u2019s the safest city, one of the cleanest cities that I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve traveled all around the world. My personal desire is to put the business here in Irvine right across from campus, if I can, and hire people from the campus. And not just from computer science, but from all over the campus, because when you\u2019re building something like this you\u2019ll need people from a psychology background, from an arts and design background, social sciences\u2014all of it. You\u2019re dealing with humans. It\u2019s a social system so you need to understand those people and different cultures.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>How did your time with ICS influence your career?</B><BR>\r\nWhen I came here, I was more into programming, but as I took more courses I built systems that were useful. That\u2019s when I realized I was learning a skill to be used in the real world. When you haven\u2019t studied a subject as a subject\u2014let\u2019s say you\u2019re an amateur programmer when you come to campus\u2014you can probably build small things here and there, but you don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re capable of building something with real-world relevance. Once you\u2019re asked to build something that addresses a real-world need, it does a few things: It gives you confidence, firstly, and then it convinces you that you can probably do something even better.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\nBack in 2002, in Campus Village, I built an AOL messenger app using Java remote method invocation (RMI), which is probably a very hard way to do such a thing, but I just wanted to learn how to build something on my own. We did a software systems project course and that was a game changer, because people from Raytheon came here and had a real demand to build something for the Department of Homeland Security.\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<B>What advice would you offer graduating students?</B><BR>\r\nAs I said, ICS is a great program, but the people I\u2019ve seen who really succeed in an entrepreneurial setting, in their individual careers, and in grad school are self-starters. Do your classes and projects, of course, but you need to do things on your own. Instead of going to a party, build something cool and make it work. Even if it doesn\u2019t work, seek advice from people around campus. Do independent studies, too. I would love to see an entrepreneurial independent study here on campus, because that would foster a lot of entrepreneurship on campus.\r\n \r\n<P>When you do things on your own, it\u2019s scary at first. In class they give you homework and say, \u2018Build this and deliver it on this date.\u2019 This is a controlled setting with a fixed time frame and a fixed objective, and peers doing the same homework. In the real world, especially in entrepreneurial settings, you control the timeline and the budget and the project objectives. You need to practice this skill over and over again.\r\n \r\n<P>\r\n<B>What would you look for in a potential hire?</B> <BR>\r\nThere\u2019s something I\u2019ve observed over the years: I had friends with super high GPAs, and I didn\u2019t have a low GPA myself, but they were too focused on succeeding in the classroom. Academic success is good, but you need to be able to do this in a non-classroom setting, especially on your own. It\u2019s good to have a track record of individually delivering on projects. ICS does a great job of teaching technical skills and how to learn on your own. Whether you have a track record is what someone like me, in a fast-growing startup setting, would look for, because resources are very thin at startups. Self-starters, self-learners\u2014that is the most important thing. It\u2019s good to have experience and internships, but pursue things on your own, even outside of independent study. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<I>UPDATE: By the end of October, Locye was accepted into the <A HREF=\"http://innovation.uci.edu/\">UCI Applied Innovations</A>' Cove Share program.
