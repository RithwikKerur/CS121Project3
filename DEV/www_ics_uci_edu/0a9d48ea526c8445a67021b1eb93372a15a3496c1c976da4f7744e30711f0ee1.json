The talk covers job scheduling problems related to utilization\nefficiency of VMs, along with questions dealing with basic communication\nissues that arise when multiple competing applications are running. We will\nalso briefly discuss questions related to scheduling on multiple-data centers.\nMany of these problems are NP-hard and we develop approximation algorithms to\ntackle these problems.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBio: Samir Khuller received his Ph.D from Cornell University in 1990 under the\nsupervision of Vijay Vazirani. He is currently a professor and distinguished\nscholar teacher at the University of Maryland.\nFrom 2003 to 2008 he was the Associate Chair for Graduate Education. and\nfrom 2012-2017 he was the Elizabeth Stevinson Iribe Chair for CS.\nAs chair he led the development of the Brendan Iribe Center for Computer\nScience and Innovation, a project slated for completion in March 2019.\nStarting March 1 (2019), he will be joining as the Adrienne and Barris Chair of\nCS at Northwestern University.\n</p>\n<p>\nHis research interests are in graph algorithms, discrete optimization, and\ncomputational geometry. He has published about 200 journal and\nconference papers, and several book chapters on these topics. He was an\neditor for the journal Algorithmica, and International Journal on\nFoundations of Computer Science, problems Editor for ACM Trans. on Algorithms,\nAssociate Editor for Networks. He has served on several program committees.\nHe was on the APPROX and ESA Steering committees for many years, and\nwill chair the program committee of the 2019 MAPSP Scheduling Workshop.\nFrom 2018-2021 he will serve as the Chair of SIGACT.\nHe received the National Science Foundation\u2019s Career Development Award,\nseveral Dept. Teaching Awards, the Dean\u2019s Teaching excellence Award\nand also a CTE-Lilly Teaching Fellowship. In 2003, he and his students were\nawarded the \u201cBest newcomer paper\u201d award for the ACM PODS and in 2016,\nhe received the European Symposium on Algorithms inaugural Test of Time Award\nfor his work with Sudipto Guha on Connected Dominating Sets.\nHis research has been funded by NSF, Amazon, Adobe, Google and DoD.\n</p>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
