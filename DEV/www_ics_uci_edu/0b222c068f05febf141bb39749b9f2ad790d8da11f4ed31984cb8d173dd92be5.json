We present\nan algorithm that finds a 1+epsilon approximation of the path in \nO(nlogn + (n/epsilon^2) log(1/epsilon)) time.\n\n<p>\nWe will also mention new progress in finding an exact shortest path.\n\n<p>\nThis is a practice talk for... TBA.  It is substantially changed (and\nhopefully \"new and improved\") from a previous talk on this topic.\n\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
