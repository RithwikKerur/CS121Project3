Mixed Raster Content Mode</h2>\n      <p>\n            This section defines the Mixed Raster Content mode or Profile M of\n            TIFF for facsimile. Implementations of this profile are required to\n            implement Profiles S and C, and may optionally implement Profiles F,\n            J and L.\n         \n      </p><a name=\"sub1\"></a><h3>8.1. Overview</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   Unlike previous fax modes, which use a single coding method and\n   spatial resolution for an entire fax page, the Mixed Raster Content\n   mode [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997.\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.44\">T.44</a>] enables different coding methods and resolutions within a\n   single page. For example, consider a page that contains black-and-\n   white text, which is best coded with MMR or JBIG, a color bar chart,\n   best coded with JBIG, and a scanned color image, best coded with\n   JPEG. Similarly, while spatial resolution of 400 pixels per inch may\n   be best for the black-and- white text, 200 pixel per inch is usually\n   sufficient for a color image.\n\n   Rather than applying one coding method and resolution to all\n   elements, MRC allows multiple coders and resolutions within a page.\n   By itself, MRC does not define any new coding methods or resolutions.\n   Instead it defines a 3-layer image model for structuring and\n   combining the scanned image data. The MRC 3-layer model has been\n   applied here using the TIFF format to yield a data structure which\n   differs from [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997.\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.44\">T.44</a>] though it applies the same coding methods, uses\n   the same compressed image data stream and is consistent with the TIFF\n   principle of a single IFD per image.\n</pre>\n      <a name=\"sub1sub1\"></a><h3>8.1.1. MRC 3-layer model</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   The 3 layers of the MRC model are Foreground and Background, which\n   are both multi-level, and Mask, which is bi-level. Each layer may\n   appear only once on a page and is coded independently of the other\n   two. In our earlier example, the black-and-white text could be in the\n   Mask layer, the color chart in the Foreground layer, and the color\n   image in the Background layer.\n\n   Each layer is an image and, when present, is represented by at least\n   one IFD in a TIFF file. This is consistent with TIFF, which provides\n   fields to define the attributes, such as resolution, image size, bits\n   per sample, etc., of a single image or layer. The distribution of\n   content among layers is determined by the writer, as is the choice of\n   coding method, color encoding and spatial resolution for a layer.\n\n   The final image is obtained by using the Mask layer to select pixels\n   from the other two layers. When the Mask layer pixel value is 1, the\n   corresponding pixel from the Foreground layer is selected; when it is\n   0, the corresponding pixel from the Background layer is selected.\n   Details are given in the Introduction of [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997.\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.44\">T.44</a>].\n\n   Not all pages, and not all parts of a page, require 3 layers. If\n   there is only one layer present, then that layer is the primary image\n   or IFD. If there is more than one layer, then the Mask must be one of\n   the layers, in which case it is the primary image and it must be page\n   size.\n\n   MRC allows a page to be split into strips, with a variable number of\n   scanlines in a strip. A strip can have 1, 2 or 3 layers. A single,\n   stripped layer may be stored as a single, stripped image in an IFD,\n   e.g., all strips associated with the Background layer may be treated\n   as a single image. Alternatively, each strip associated with a layer\n   may be stored as a separate image or IFD, e.g., the Background layer\n   can be composed of several images that are offset vertically with\n   respect to the page. In this case, there can be no overlap between\n   images associated with a single layer. According to [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>] Annex G,\n   strips having more than 1 layer SHOULD NOT be more than 256 lines in\n   length unless the capability to receive longer strips has been\n   negotiated.\n\n   Furthermore, color fax also requires the spatial resolutions of\n   Background and Foreground images to be legal fax values that are also\n   integer factors of the Mask image resolution. For example, if the\n   Mask Layer resolution is 400 pixels per inch, then allowed\n   resolutions for the Foreground and Background layers are 100, 200 or\n   400 pixels per inch; if the Mask is at 300 pixels per inch, then\n   allowed values are 100 and 300. The Foreground and Background layer\n   resolutions can be independently set.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub1sub2\"></a><h3>8.1.2. A TIFF Representation for the MRC 3-layer model</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   In the TIFF representation of the 3-layer MRC model, each page is\n   represented by a single IFD, called the Primary IFD, that represents\n   the Mask layer (unless the Foreground or Background is the single\n   layer present), and a set of child IFDs that are referenced through\n   the SubIFDs extension field [<a title=\"Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf\" href=\"chapter11.html#TTN1\">TTN1</a>]. To distinguish MRC-specific\n\n   SubIFDs from other SubIFDs, the NewSubFileType field MUST have Bit 4\n   ON, indicating an MRC-related IFD. A new ImageLayer field is also\n   introduced that consists of two values that identify the layer\n   (Foreground, Background, or Mask) and the order within the layer\n   (first, second, ... image of the layer); see Section 8.2.3.\n\n   Because MRC allows strips with variable numbers of scanlines, a\n   reader MUST support StripRowCounts field because a writer may use it\n   in place of the RowsPerStrip field in this mode. The StripRowCounts\n   field allows each layer, with a variable number of scanlines in each\n   strip, to be represented by a single IFD, when the coding parameters\n   are the same for all strips in the layer. The MRC standard [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.44, Mixed Raster Content (MRC), October 1997.\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.44\">T.44</a>]\n   allows the Foreground and Background layers to have strips with\n   different coding parameters. In this case, a separate IFD is required\n   to represent the strips which use different coding parameters; see\n   text in next paragraph. In all cases, the Mask layer is required to\n   be represented by a single IFD and a single set of coding parameters.\n\n   The use of SubIFDs to store child IFDs is described in [<a title=\"Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf\" href=\"chapter11.html#TTN1\">TTN1</a>]. An\n   example is shown graphically below. The Primary IFD associated with\n   page 1 (PrimaryIFD 0) points to page 2 (PrimaryIFD 1) with the\n   nextIFD offset. The Primary IFD, corresponding to the Mask layer\n   (ImageLayer=[2,1]), contains a SubIFDs field that points to a list of\n   child IFDs. The first child IFD represents one image of the\n   Background layer, i.e., ImageLayer=[1,1]. This child IFD points to\n   the second child IFD via the nextIFD offset. This child represents\n   the second Background layer image, ImageLayer=[1,2]. Finally, the\n   second child points to the third child, which corresponds to the\n   single Foreground layer image, ImageLayer=[3,1]. The next IFD offset\n   associated with this Foreground image is 0, indicating no more child\n   IFDs exist. Each primary IFD has the NewSubFileType set to 18,\n   indicating the IFD is MRC-specific (bit 4) and that it is a single\n   page of a multi-page document (bit 1). Each child IFD has the\n   NewSubFileType set to 16, indicating the IFD is MRC-specific. The 'V'\n   character should be read as a down-pointing arrow.\n\n                       (nextIFD)\n       PRIMARY IFD 0  ------------&gt; PRIMARY IFD 1--&gt; ...\n           ImageLayer = [2,1]\n           NewSubFileType = 18\n           SubIFDs\n                |\n                V\n             Child IFD\n                ImageLayer = [1,1]\n                NewSubFileType = 16\n                |\n                |(nextIFD)\n\n                |\n                V\n             Child IFD\n                ImageLayer = [1,2]\n                NewSubFileType = 16\n                |\n                |(nextIFD)\n                |\n                V\n             Child IFD\n                ImageLayer = [3,1]\n                NewSubFileType = 16\n                |\n                |(nextIFD)\n                V\n                0\n\n   In the example above, the SubIFDs field of the Primary IFD points to\n   the first IFD in a list of child IFDs. TIFF allows the SubIFDs field\n   to point to an array of IFDs, each of which can be the first of a\n   list of IFDs. An MRC-enabled TIFF reader must scan all available\n   child IFDs to locate and identify IFDs associated with MRC layers.\n\n   In the case where the Background or Foreground layers are described\n   with multiple IFDs, the XPosition and YPosition TIFF fields specify\n   the offset to the upper-left corner of the IFD with respect to the\n   Mask layer; see Section 8.2.2. When there is only a single layer\n   (Mask, Foreground, or Background), it is stored as the Primary IFD.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub2\"></a><h3>8.2.

Each Primary IFD and each MRC-specific SubIFD must have an\n      ImageLayer field to specify which layer the IFD belongs to, and\n      the imaging order of that IFD within the layer.\n\n   5. Each Primary IFD must have a NewSubFileType field value set to 18,\n      indicating a single page of a multi-page document (bit 1) and MRC\n      mode (bit 4).\n\n   6. Each MRC-specific child IFD must have a NewSubFileType field value\n      set to 16, indicating MRC mode (bit 4).\n\n   7. In MRC mode, each layer is transmitted as a sequence of strips. It\n      is possible that each strip of each layer can be stored as a\n      separate IFD. In this case, the SubIFDs structure pointed to by\n      the Primary IFD will contain several IFDs that have an ImageLayer\n      field with the layer identified as either Background (layer 1) or\n      Foreground (layer 3). There may be no overlap in the vertical\n      direction between IFDs associated with a single layer, although\n      there may be a gap from one of these images to the next. The TIFF\n      XPosition and YPosition fields are used to indicate the placement\n      of these images with respect to the primary image.\n\n   8. When the Mask image is present, the resolution of Background and\n      Foreground images must each be an integer factor of the Mask\n      image. For example, if the Mask image is 400 pixels/inch, then the\n      Background or Foreground image may be at 400 pixels/inch (400/1),\n      200 pixels/inch (400/2) or 100 pixels/inch (400/4).\n</pre>\n      <a name=\"sub5\"></a><h3>8.5.
