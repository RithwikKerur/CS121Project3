There is much mystery surrounding his heritage. Family lore has it that he was a direct descendant of <a href=\"../issachar.htm\">Issachar</a>, son of our patriarch, Jacob. A book regarding his ancestry and offspring has been compiled by Suzan Wynne. Her work, entitled <B>The Langsam-Spira Family</B>, is still available. I have attempted in these pages to cover or expand on areas not dealt with in her study. Suzan recently shared a copy of a death certificate for a Pesach Langsam, who died on Nov 2, 1820, at the age of 72. This would place his birth in 1748. Regarding Pesach's earlier years, there is still much supposition. Even his wife's name was disputed, although it was later proven not to be Rochel Mina. Most likely it was Ita. One thing is for certain. At some point they lived in a small town in Galicia called Jawornik Polski. It is near Blazowa &amp; Dynow. Pesach had 6 known children; five boys and one girl.\r\n\t<BR>\r\nThese links to the left contain information, sometimes in the form of an e-mail, that enhances what may already be known from <B>The Langsam-Spira Family</B>.\r\n\t<BR>\r\n\t</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n\t<TD><IMG SRC=\"../img/blankdot.gif\" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=40 BORDER=0>\r\n\t</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n<TR>\r\n\t<TD COLSPAN=2>\r\n\tI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller \tfamily.<P>\r\n\t<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n\t<BR>\r\n\tMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n\t</PRE>  \r\n  \t<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 6/5/00</FONT>\r\n\t</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
