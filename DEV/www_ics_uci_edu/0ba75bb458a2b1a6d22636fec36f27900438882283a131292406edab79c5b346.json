This\nproject proposes to create a learning experience using virtual world\ntechnology that will bring the slave trade experience from its origins\nthe West Coast of Africa<br>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Motivation</span> <br>\n\nThe motivation for this virtual tour project - for making the history\nof the slave trade come alive, is to give true meaning to the proverb:\n``let us forgive but let us never forget.&#8217;&#8217; By creating a virtual\nenvironment that renders the story of the slave trade, from its origins\non the Western Coast of Africa, to its final destinations on the shores\nof the western side of the Atlantic, with a near to realistic\nexperience of the journey suffered by so many, we will foster a\nstronger appreciation and understanding of one of history&#8217;s most\nshameful eras. A virtual 3D immersive tour will<br>\n\n&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spark the interest of our children and youth as\nthey learn about it in school,<br>\n\n&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serve as a valuable tool for historians and\nscholars the world over, and <br>\n\n&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make the history of the African slave trade\naccessible to all. <br>\n\n<br>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Zip Files</span><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Emagda/Projects/elmina-exp.zip\">Elmina</a><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Emagda/Projects/3D%20MIO.zip\">More 1</a><br>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Emagda/Projects/LOOP.rar\">More 2</a><br>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Video</span><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Emagda/Projects/JagoCinematicDemo.mp4\">Gold Coast and Jago Castle</a><br>\n\n</body></html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
