This settles an open problem whether hereditary permutation \nproperties are strongly testable, i.e., testable with respect \nto the Kendall's tau distance. In addition, our method also yields a proof\nof a conjecture of Hoppen, Kohayakawa, Moreira and Sampaio on the\nrelation of the rectangular distance and the Kendall's tau distance of\na permutation from a hereditary property. \n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
