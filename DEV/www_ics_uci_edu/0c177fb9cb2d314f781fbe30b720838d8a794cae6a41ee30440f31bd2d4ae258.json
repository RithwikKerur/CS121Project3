Azhar, G. Badros, A. Glodjo, M. Kao and J.\nReif from <a href= \n\"http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~dcc/Programs/Program94.html\">DCC\n'94</a>.) \n\n<p>This paper presents advanced data compression techniques for\npredicting stock markets behavior under widely accepted market\nmodels in finance. Our techniques are applicable to technical\nanalysis, portfolio theory, and nonlinear market models. We find\nthat lossy and lossless compression techniques are well suited for\npredicting stock prices as well as market modes such as strong\ntrends and major adjustments. We also present novel applications of\nmultispectral compression techniques to portfolio theory,\ncorrelation of similar stocks, effects of interest rates,\ntransaction costs and taxes.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
