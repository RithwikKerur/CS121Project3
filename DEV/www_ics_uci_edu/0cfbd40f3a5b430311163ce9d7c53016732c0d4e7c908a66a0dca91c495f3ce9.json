I am\n&gt;| checking in the document that I previously checked out\n&gt;| for editing. Here it is.\" The RCS can verify that it is\n&gt;| the same user that is recorded and proceed, or reject\n&gt;| the action if it is not the same user.\n&gt;|\n&gt;\n&gt;Very close, except I'm not asserting that the revision control system\n&gt;_should_ record anything when a user starts to edit a document.  Instead,\n&gt;I say that there are many systems that _do_ record something, and that\n&gt;HTTP _should_ cart around a token (\"or cookie\" ) of this recorded\n&gt;information.\n\nRight.  I quoted \"should\" to indicate that it was a goo idea,\nnot a requirement. The cookie, in this case, is like a certificate\nthat lets the user know that the transaction was completed and\nthat the document has officially been checked out.\n&gt;\n&gt;For something like RCS or CVS, the cookie might be only a name and rev\n&gt;of the document.  For Clearcase or Perforce, the cookie might be an\n&gt;inscrutable pointer to info in its database.  For less version-stringent\n&gt;systems, there may be no cookie at all.\n\nI would think that the cookie should only contain the most \nbasic of information, such as a pair of values to validate\nthe check out (an ID) and a record of the cookie that was issued.\nThe RCS could, at its discretion, maintain a database of the\npointer into the database etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;| Christopher is asserting that a \"cookie\" is the best,\n&gt;| if not the only, way to manage the session.\n&gt;\n&gt;Perhaps there is another way?\n\nCertainly the document itself could carry information\nalong with it, in a META tag or on any tag that we can\nlegitimately propose. This would allow arbitrary \nauthoring tools to have access to whatever information\nthe RCS provides -- without having to inspect any cookies\nthat might be associated with the document. I am including \nNotepad in my definition of arbitrary authoring tools.\nFor debugging purposes, I think that it will be useful\nto carry info in the document. \n\n&gt;\n&gt;Christopher\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\nMurray Maloney                   \"Life is a daring adventure,\nTechnical Director                or it is nothing\" \nSoftQuad Inc                      -- Helen Keller\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0126.html\">Bruce Brown: \"Re: Seiwald Q &amp; A -- \"GET for EDIT\" cookies\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0124.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Seiwald Q &amp; A -- \"GET for EDIT\" cookies\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
