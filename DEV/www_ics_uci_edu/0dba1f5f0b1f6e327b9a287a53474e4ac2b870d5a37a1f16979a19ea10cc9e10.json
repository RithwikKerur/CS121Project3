It soon became\nclear that others had looked at modified bow-and-arrow beam detectors,\nincluding E. Makai, who had published in 1980 a construction with length\n4.8189.\nHe later noted that one of the segments forming an end of the \"bow\"\ncan be separated and tilted to form another \"arrow\", making\na very small further improvement.\n\n<P>\n\nSince then, several articles have appeared on the subject of \"opaque\nforests\".  This is apparently the same idea as that of a beam detector,\nwith three changes.  First, the detector is explicitly required to be a\nforest (set of line segments).  Second, the set of lines that must be\ndetected is that crossing some particular polygon, rather than a circle.\nAnd third, the detector must be contained entirely within that polygon.\nThis third restriction changes the problem completely;\nfor the circle, all boundary points would have to be part of such\na forest, and the total length would be 2 pi.\nSome early works on this subject assumed that generalizations of the bow-and-arrow idea gave the correct solution, but T. Shermer in 1991 showed\nthat in some cases one can find a better opaque forest by keeping everything connected (computing a <I>Steiner tree</I>).\n\n<P>\n\nMy latest (but half-baked) idea for a beam detector combines the\nhexagon, bow and arrow, and\nSteiner tree.  Start with a hexagon ABCDEF circumscribing the circle.\nConnect vertices ABDE with a Steiner tree.\nFinally, drop a line segment from the remaining two vertices C and F\nto the nearest side of quadrilateral ABDE.\nBut for the regular hexagon (illustrated below),\nthis produces a beam detector with total length 2/sqrt 3 + 4,\napproximately 5.1547, not bad but worse than the bow and arrow.\n(Thanks to John Rickard for the length; I initially miscalculated this value\nto be 4.464.) I suspect (but have not calculated) that\nnon-regular hexagons can be used to improve this value even further,\nbut maybe that would still not be enough to get a better beam detector.\n\n<P><CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"newbeam.gif\" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=344\nALT=\"New beam detector\"></CENTER><P>\n\nThe latest news in Scientific American\nis of a constructor by J. Day with length 4.7998,\nbut this is not much of an improvement on Makai's bound,\nand looks like it may be the same as Makai's old two-arrow improvement.\nIs there a better beam detector?\n<P>\nReferences:\n<UL>\n<LI>V.
