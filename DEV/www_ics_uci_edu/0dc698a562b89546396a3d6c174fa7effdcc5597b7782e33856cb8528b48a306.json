I basically concur with his\nassessment of where we agree and disagree, but there are three\nissues he raises with regard to the scientific status of\nparapsychology to which I would like to respond. </p>\n\n<p><strong>1. &quot;Only parapsychology, among the fields of\ninquiry claiming scientific status, lacks a cumulative database\n(p. 6).&quot; </strong></p>\n\n<p>It is simply not true that parapsychology lacks a cumulative\ndatabase. In fact, the accumulated database is truly impressive\nfor a science that has had so few resources. While critics are\nfond of relating, as Professor Hyman does in his report, that\nthere has been &quot;more than a century of parapsychological\nresearch (p. 7)&quot; psychologist Sybo Schouten (1993, p. 316)\nhas noted that the total human and financial resources devoted to\nparapsychology since 1882 is at best equivalent to the\nexpenditures devoted to fewer than two months of research in\nconventional psychology in the United States. </p>\n\n<p>On pages 4 and 5 of their September 29, 1994 SAIC final\nreport, May, Luke and James summarize four reports that do\nprecisely what Professor Hyman claims is not done in\nparapsychology; they put forth the accumulated evidence for\nanomalous cognition in a variety of formats. Rather than\ndismissing the former experiments, parapsychologists build on\nthem. As in any area of science, it is of course the most recent\nexperiments that receive the most attention, but that does not\nmean that the field would divorce itself from past work. Quite to\nthe contrary, past experimental results and methodological\nweaknesses are used to design better and more efficient\nexperiments. </p>\n\n<p>As an example of the normal progress of inquiry expected in\nany area of science, the autoganzfeld experiments currently\nconducted by parapsychologists did not simply spring out of thin\nair. The original ganzfeld experiments followed from Honorton's\nobservation at Maimonides Medical Center, that anomalous\ncognition seemed to work well in dreams. He investigated ways in\nwhich a similar state could be achieved in normal waking hours,\nand found the ganzfeld regime in another area of psychology. The\nautomated ganzfeld followed from a critical evaluation of the\nearlier ganzfeld experiments, and a set of conditions agreed upon\nby Honorton and Professor Hyman. The current use of dynamic\ntargets in autoganzfeld experiments follows from the observation\nthat they were more successful than static targets in the initial\nexperiments. The investigation of entropy at SAIC follows from\nthis observation as well. This is just one example of how current\nexperiments are built from past results. </p>\n\n<p><strong>2. &quot;Only parapsychology claims to be a science on\nthe basis of phenomena (or a phenomenon) whose presence can be\ndetected only by rejecting a null hypothesis (p. 8).&quot; </strong></p>\n\n<p>While it is true that parapsychology has not figured out all\nthe answers, it does not differ from normal science in this\nregard. It is the norm of scientific progress to make\nobservations first, and then to attempt to explain them. Before\nquantum mechanics was developed there were a number of anomalies\nobserved in physics that could not be explained. There are many\nobservations in physics and in the social and medical sciences\nthat can be observed, either statistically or deterministically,\nbut which cannot be explained. </p>\n\n<p>As a more recent example, consider the impact of\nelectromagnetic fields on health. An article in <cite>Science</cite>\n(Vol. 269, 18 August 1995, p. 911) reported that &quot;After\nspending nearly a decade reviewing the literature on\nelectromagnetic fields (EMFs), a panel of the National Council on\nRadiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) has produced a draft\nreport concluding that some health effects linked to EMFs such as\ncancer and immune deficiencies appear real and warrant steps to\nreduce EMF exposure... Biologists have failed to pinpoint a\nconvincing mechanism of action.&quot; In other words, a\nstatistical effect has been convincingly established and it is\nnow the responsibility of science to attempt to establish its\nmechanism, just as in parapsychology. </p>\n\n<p>As yet another example, consider learning and memory, which\nhave long been studied in psychology. We know they exist, but\nbrain researchers are just beginning to understand how they work\nby using sophisticated brain imaging techniques. Psychologists do\nnot understand these simple human capabilities, and they\ncertainly do not understand other observable human phenomena such\nas what causes people to fall in love. Yet, no one would deny the\nexistence of these phenomena just because we do not understand\nthem. </p>\n\n<p>In any area involving the natural variability inherent in\nhumans, science progresses by first observing a statistical\ndifference and then attempting to explain it. At this stage, I\nbelieve parapsychology has convincingly demonstrated that an\neffect is present, and future research attempts should be\ndirected at finding an explanation. In this regard parapsychology\nin on par with scientific questions like the impact of\nelectromagnetic fields on health, or the cross-cultural\ndifferences in memory that have been observed by psychologists. </p>\n\n<p><strong>3. &quot;Parapsychology is the only field of\nscientific inquiry that does not have even one exemplar that can\nbe assigned to students with the expectation that they will\nobserve the original results (p. 18).&quot; </strong></p>\n\n<p>I disagree with this statement for two reasons. First, I can\nname other phenomena for which students could not be expected to\ndo a simple experiment and observe a result, such as the\nconnection between taking aspirin and preventing heart attacks or\nthe connection between smoking and getting lung cancer. What\ndifferentiates these phenomena from simple experiments like\nsplitting light with a prism is that the effects are statistical\nin nature and are not expected to occur every single time. Not\neveryone who smokes gets lung cancer, but we can predict the\nproportion who will. Not everyone who attempts anomalous\ncognition will be successful, but I think we can predict the\nproportion of time success should be achieved. </p>\n\n<p>Since I believe the probability of success has been\nestablished in the autoganzfeld experiments, I would offer them\nas the exemplar Professor Hyman requests. The problem is that to\nbe relatively assured of a successful outcome requires several\nhundred trials, and no student has the resources to commit to\nthis experiment. As I have repeatedly tried to explain to\nProfessor Hyman and others, when dealing with a small to medium\neffect it takes hundreds or sometimes thousands of trials to\nestablish &quot;statistical significance.&quot; In fact, the\nPhysicians Health Study that initially established the link\nbetween taking aspirin and reducing heart attacks studied over\n22,000 men. Had it been conducted on only 2,200 men with the same\nreduction in heart attacks, it would not have achieved\nstatistical significance. Should students be required to recruit\n22,000 participants and conduct such an experiment before we\nbelieve the connection between aspirin and heart attacks is real?\n</p>\n\n<p>Despite Professor Hyman's continued protests about\nparapsychology lacking repeatability, I have never seen a skeptic\nattempt to perform an experiment with enough trials to even come\nclose to insuring success. The parapsychologists who have\nrecently been willing to take on this challenge have indeed found\nsuccess in their experiments, as described in my original report.\n</p>\n\n<hr noshade>\n\n<p><a name=\"8.\"></a><b>REFERENCE</b></p>\n\n<p>S<font size=\"2\">CHOUTEN</font>, S<font size=\"2\">YBO</font>\n(1993). &quot;Are we making progress?&quot; In <cite>Psi Research\nMethodology: A Re-examination, Proceedings of an International\nConference, Oct 29-30, 1988</cite>, edited by L.
