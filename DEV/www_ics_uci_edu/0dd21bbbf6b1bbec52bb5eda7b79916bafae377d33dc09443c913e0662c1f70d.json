Angela and Chris neglected to find one, but Kim, the wedding planner, had it in hand, or so she thought. When she got to the reception the bartenders had set up over the table under which she'd placed it, and she couldn't find it. She tried bribing Aaron to crawl under the tables looking for it but he couldn't find it either. Finally one of the bartenders found it while looking for something else.\n<h5>Taken Saturday, June 14, 2008, 06:30:48PM.\nOriginal image size: 3888x2592, 872kb<br>\nTechnical details: Canon EOS 40D, 1/125s@ F1.8, ISO 1250, 50mm f/1.4 (80mm equiv)<br>\nPS CRW 2000:-50, Exp0.25, LS100</h5>\n</div></body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
