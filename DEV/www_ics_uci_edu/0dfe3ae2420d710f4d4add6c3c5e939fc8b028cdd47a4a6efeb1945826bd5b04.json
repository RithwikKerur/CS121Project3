I don't know how much progress has been made since April,\n&gt; 1998 but it occurs to me that a curved fold might yield some benefit. The\n\nno progress at all - it is not a particularly serious project for me.\n\nYour configuration is a nice one I hadn't thought of - I only considered\nteabags with 4-fold rotational symmetry.  This was guided by the shape of\ninflated wine cask liners.  I seem to have had more exposure to these in my\nlife than McDonald's (being vegetarian).  I did, come to the same\nrealisation about curved folds - they are used in my last example in the\ncurved pleats (half the curved triangles that jut out of the quadrant need\nto be folded back in)\n\nSome of my thoughts about your configuration:\n\n* It should be quite easy to work out a volume if you model the main part of\nthe curved surface - it will only need z as (say) a function of x on an\ninterval [-a,a].  For the paper not to stretch, the arc length of this\nfunction is 1.  The volume is then the integral of z(1-z).  I would suggest\ntrying a class of functions (e.g. arcs) with a single parameter (e.g.\nangle), then using 1-variable calculus or numerical methods.\n* If you have the skills, this would be one where variational method, such\nas is used to get the catenary as the chain curve.  I would expect that the\nformulae in this calculus of variations calculation would be would neater\nthan for any of the configurations I dreamed up, but this does not mean that\nit would be easy.\n* From an intuitive perspective, I guess that having the corners on a square\nwould be optimal.  If you can get hold of a wine cask liner and safely\ndispose of its contents (easier said than done, although they are also used\nfor 5 litre OJ boxes over here) then you might be able to convince yourself\nof this.\n* Your configuration can be inflated slightly more by slanting the vertical\nsides -- this will make them project below the plane, and so another curved\nfold would be required, making a curved pleat like I used between the cones\nin my last example.  This was my very first step in this problem, converting\n\nIf I get an idle moment, I may try the variational problem.\n\nLet me know if you get anywhere - I could link or include it.\n\nRegards, Andrew\n</PRE><HR><PRE><B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             Tom Longtin &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:tlongtin@sover.net\">tlongtin@sover.net</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Maximum Volume of a Teabag\n<B>Date:</B>           Thu, 12 Nov 1998 17:30:12 -0800 (PST)\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nYour idea of using curved folds for the teabag problem is fascinating --\nwould you mind if I added your message to my page?\n\nI'm thinking the volume computations might be easier to work through if\nyou specified the eventual cross section of the folded figure, rather than\nthe shape of the curve.  All you need is to specify a given convex curve\ny=f(x) with f(w/2)=f(-w/2)=0 for some w&lt;1, where the length of the curve\nfrom (-w/2,0) to (w/2,0) is 1; then it's possible to fold a shape\nthat in cross-section looks like that curve, and viewed from above\nlooks like a 1 by w rectangle, with indentations in the shape of the\nsame curve.\n\nE.g. if the cross-section is a semicircle of length 1 (so radius 1/pi),\nyou can form a shape that is a circular cylinder of radius 1/pi\nand length 1, minus two cylindrical indentations at the two short ends.\nThe flattened shape of the fold is not a circle,\nbut is instead a sine curve.\n\nThe two indentations can be reassembled to form a shape that is the\nintersection of two of these cylinders.  So the volume of the overall\nshape is the same as that of the unindented cylinder (1/pi) minus the\ntwo-cylinder intersection (16/3pi^3 unless I've miscalculated).\n\n1/pi - 16/3pi^3 ~ 0.1463, rather worse than the current best solution\n1.902, but maybe a semicircular cross-section is not best...\n\nIf two curved folds are good, maybe four curved folds (one on each side\nof the square) are even better?\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           Tom Longtin &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:tlongtin@sover.net\">tlongtin@sover.net</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Maximum Volume of a Teabag\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 13 Nov 1998 13:05:59 -0500 (EST)\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nHi David -\n\nOn Thu, 12 Nov 1998, David Eppstein wrote:\n\n&gt; Your idea of using curved folds for the teabag problem is fascinating --\n&gt; would you mind if I added your message to my page?\n \nThanks - please feel free to do so and I will work on more illustrations -\npossibly a VRML model.\n\nAndrew Kepert also responded with interest on this which I hope can be\npart of the dialog.

So long as the fold ends up being all\nin one plane, you consider this a mirror plane through which one part\nof the paper is reflected.  Then the condition on it being foldable is\nthat the unfolded (i.e. configuration with the mirrored bit un-mirrored)\nsheet is bendable - usually a cone or cylinder of some cross-section.\n\nTo get the slanted side of your chip cup (umm *fries*, sorry) to work,\nsay with a circular cross-section of the main (horizontal) bit, you need\ntherefore to have a circular cylinder in the near-vertical section,\nwith the curve of intersection being an arc of an ellipse (in some\nslanted plane)  This means that the fold-line (when unwrapped) will\nbe an arc of a sine curve.  By similar reasoning, the curve where\nthe near-vertical side cuts through the horizontal base-plane will again\nbe an ellipse, but appear as a sine curve before folding.  Same wavelength,\nsmaller amplitude, at a guess.\n\nOn the other hand, if you start out with an arc of a circle as your\nfold-line, my guess is that an arc of an ellipse would give you the\nother fold.  Probably one where the major axis is equal to the\ndiameter of the circular arc.  However, I have no idea what the profile\nof the surface would be.\n\nAndrew\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Tue, 17 Nov 1998 21:15:49 -0500 (EST)\n<B>From:</B>           Tom Longtin &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:tlongtin@sover.net\">tlongtin@sover.net</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Teabag Problem\n<B>To:</B>             Kepert &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:andrew@frey.newcastle.edu.au\">andrew@frey.newcastle.edu.au</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nHi Andrew -\n\nJust to let you know that David Eppstein has posted his and my ruminations\nconcerning the teabag problem - please be included on your page or if you\nlike, with your permission, I will forward your contributions thus far to\nDavid:\n\nwww.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/teabag.html\n\nI'm looking at a circular curved fold which extends nearly to the center\nof the square whereby the concave end can no longer be vertical and\nmaintain all edges in the plane - it needs to be inclined inwards thus\nreducing the volume.

I worked out the volume \nas pi * 2^(1/2) * (3^(1/2) - 1)/16 which is 2.03276003.  My best \nsolution is around 0.2055.  2/pi^2=3D2.02642367 would have been a neat \nsolution, but we have already passed it.  On the other hand, no-one \nhas verified my calculations ...\n\nMy 2.055 is not optimal either -- the profile of the cone can be \nperturbed from being circular for some gain.  A rough variational \nargument convinced me that the property of the optimal profile curve \nis that the radius of curvature is proportional to the length of the \nside of the cone before it hits the axis planes.  (See the image of \n1/8 of the teabag on the above page for what I mean by this distance.)\n\nNote that \"radius of curvature\" for a cone needs to be defined \nproperly -- it can be done in terms of the tan of the slant angle, or \nequivalently, a section through the cone at distance 1.\n\nGetting a profile curve from this invariant property is another \nmatter, though.  A finite-element simulation may be the only way.\n\nCheers, Andrew\n\nAt 7:51 PM +0000 28/9/02, Narasimham G.L. wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;To\n&gt;\n&gt;David Eppstein, Paul Earwicker, Tom Longtin, Andrew Kepert and \n&gt;others who participated in the Tea Bag.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Dear Tea Bag problem enthusiasts,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;SUB : Tea Bag volume constant  could be 2/p2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;With the above problem Ziploc Conjecture recently in sci.math , the \n&gt;following was brought to notice by David Eppstein\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/teabag.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/teabag.html</A>&gt;<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/teabag.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/teabag.html</A>\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem has absorbing interest, that it was hitherto not addressed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I am trying to prove my own Conjecture, but the following are \n&gt;observations for time being.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Ziploc conjecture and Tea Bag problem essentially address the \n&gt;same problem, i.e., what max volume can be contained by a given \n&gt;wetted area of water, or a powdery substance, inside a square bag. \n&gt;It turns out the Ziploc problem is the guessed or conjectured \n&gt;solution to the Tea Bag, given below.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In the corner of the Tea Bag, one obtains cones filled with water. \n&gt;This is expected and explainable. The Tea/water bags continue to be \n&gt;developable surfaces with zero Gauss curvature everywhere. The \n&gt;regular shapes discernable are cones and cylinder in the middle of \n&gt;the bag. Other transition pieces also are intrinsically flat, having \n&gt;an irregular shape, and hitherto are not given a name, presumably \n&gt;due to their irregular geometry. However, it is sure that one \n&gt;direction is straight, at any point of the bag. As swept polar angle \n&gt;around corner containing cone apex is 2*pi*sin(alpha)=2*pi/2=pi, by \n&gt;virtue of local development, we must have sin(alpha)=1/2  or the \n&gt;cones must have semi-vertical angle 30 degrees. This is in fact the \n&gt;case; one finds these right circular (not oblique, as before \n&gt;thought) cones.
