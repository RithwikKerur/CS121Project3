They show that no\nconstant-competitive truthful auction is envy-free.  They also show that\nby relaxing the problem to instead being truthful with small probability\nof being envy-free, or vice versa, auctions can be competitive.  \n<p>\nDefinitions:\n<p>\n<I>Truthful</I>:  any bidder's best strategy is to bid the maximum value they are\nwilling to pay\n<br>\n<I>Envy-Free</I>:  after the auction is run, no bidder would be happier with the\noutcome of another bidder\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
