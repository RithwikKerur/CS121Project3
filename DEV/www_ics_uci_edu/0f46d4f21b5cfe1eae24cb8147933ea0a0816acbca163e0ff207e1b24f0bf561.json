IRUS has proven to be a\nsignificant channel for technology inputs at Sun.\"<br>\n<em>Dr. Thomas D. Arkwright, Java Architect</em><br>\n<b>Sun Microsystems</b>\n\n<p>\n\"The IRUS software engineering and computer science faculty at \nUC Irvine have shown a consistently high level of commitment to \nworking closely with their industry partners. This is reflected in the \nselection of research topics that are relevant to the needs of indus\ntry, such as hypertext technology, software process support, and \nsoftware testing. It is also reflected in the industry-relevant themes \nof the research colloquia that they organize, such as the California \nSoftware Symposium. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it is \nreflected in the ongoing, frequent informal interactions they wel\ncome and encourage from their industry partners.\" <br>\n<em>Gregory F. Johnson, Principal Engineer</em> <br>\n<b>Northrop Grumman Corporation</b>\n\n<p>\n\"IRUS has provided a forum for Boeing to openly communicate \nwith academia on topics relevant to its software process improve\nment needs. Boeing's participation in IRUS has also provided the \nopportunity to interact, coordinate and collaborate with other com\npanies in the exchange of information, experiences, and ideas that \nare unique to the development of high quality software through \nprocess improvement.\"<br> \n<em>Paul Arnold, Senior Manager, Software Engineering Technology</em><br>\n<b>The Boeing Company</b>\n\n<p>\n\"Beckman is pleased to continue our sponsorship of the Irvine Research \nUnit in Software. Through a variety of events and forums IRUS provides \nan opportunity for industry and academia to exchange ideas on current \nbest practices as well as peek into the future.\" <br>\n<em>Gayle Nobbs, Manager, Software Development Diagnostics Center</em><br>\n<b>Beckman Instruments </b>\n\n<p>\n\"TRW has supported IRUS for the past six years and has been active in \nthe Southern California SPIN, California Software Symposium (CSS), \nthe Conference on Software Process Improvement (CoSPI), and technol\nogy symposia such as \"WIRED: the Internet and the World Wide Web\", \nand technical research reviews. IRUS activities have provided us with \nthe opportunity to exchange software engineering knowledge with in\ndustry, government, and academia.\"<br>\n<em>Barbara Mann, Chair, Data Technologies Division SEPG</em><br>\n<b>TRW </b>\n\n<p>\n\"Printronix is very pleased to be an industry sponsor for IRUS. Software\nengineering is a rapidly expanding component of our product develop\nment, and our association with IRUS has provided us with the capability\nto network with other companies, and academia, on trends and advance\nments that are important to our engineers. The seminars provide very \ncurrent information and the topics have been quite relevant to our devel\nopment environment.\"<br>\n<em>Andy Chapman, Vice President, Engineering</em><br>\n<b>Printronix, Inc.</b>\n\n<p>\n\"The Southern California SPIN and other IRUS programs help FileNet \nengineering managers and staff stay current with the ever-changing \n\"state of the practice\" in the worldwide software industry. IRUS' collab\norative programs on object-oriented methods, testing, software quality \nassurance, process technology, reuse and metrics have helped us inte\ngrate new software technology into our engineering practices, which is \nessential if we are to continue to be a major player   in the dynamic\ninformation technology markets of the 90's.\"<br>\n<em>Bill Ball, Director, Software Quality Assurance and Support</em><br>\n<b>FileNet Corporation</b>\n\n<p>\n\"We have been an industry sponsor of IRUS for seven years and continue to be \nan enthusiastic supporter of this new model of industry/university\ncollaboration. \nThe Southern California SPIN, California Software Symposium, Bay Area \nRoundtable (BART), and special events such as the Conference on Software\nProcess Improvement and World Wide Web and Internet symposium are just a\nfew of the reasons we feel IRUS has been a WINNER for us!\"<br>\n<em>Terry Snyder, Corporate Vice-President, Systems and Software Engineering\n</em><br>\n<b>Hughes Electronics Corporation </b>\n\n<p>\n\"Northrop Grumman has been a sponsor of IRUS for seven years. \nSoftware engineering professionals throughout the company fre\nquently participate in the various activities that IRUS offers.
