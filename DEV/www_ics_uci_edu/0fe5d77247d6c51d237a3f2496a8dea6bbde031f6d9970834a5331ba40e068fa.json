Is it always safe to cut\noff degree-three vertices until no more are left, and if so what should\nbe done when none are left?\nUnfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~deloera/RECENT_WORK/abstract.ps\">de Loera et al recently proved\nthat this minimum-complexity triangulation problem is\nNP-complete</a>.\n<P>\nNevertheless, the problem has some connections to a still-open problem on binary trees studied by Sleator,\nTarjan, and Thurston.  They showed that if one changes one tree to another\nusing a standard operation called <I>rotation</I>, this corresponds to a\ntriangulation of a certain polyhedron in which each rotation corresponds\nto a tetrahedron.\nTheir results on the tree rotation problem can be interpreted as meaning\nthat some polyhedra require as many as 2n-10 tetrahedra, the number that\nwould be generated by connecting everything to one vertex.\nThe rotation-distance triangulation is topological (an\nabstract simplicial complex) while the NP-completeness proof relies on\nthe geometric configuration of the polyhedron vertices, so does not seem\nto shed light on this problem.\n<P>\nIf three dimensions isn't hard enough, one can always ask similar questions in higher dimensions.  The answers aren't known even for such simple shapes as hypercubes.  The connect-to-one-vertex strategy still works, and generates\nd! simplices.  Just as in three dimensions, one can do a little better,\nbut not much better: <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0204157\">the\nbest known triangulations</a> are still within a\nsingle-exponential factor of d!.\nOn the other hand, the best lower bounds known are that the number of simplices\nmust at least be within a single-exponential factor of sqrt d!.  So\nthere's still a pretty big gap to close.\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
