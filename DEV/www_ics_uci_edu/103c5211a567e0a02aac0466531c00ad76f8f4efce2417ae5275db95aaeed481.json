Takenouchi.\nOn an indeterminate equation.\n<BR><I>Proc. Physico-Mathematical Soc. of Japan\n</I>(3rd ser.) 3, 1921, pp. 78-92.\n<BR>In this paper, discovered for me by Stefan Bartels, Takenouchi proves that any number with a k-term unit fraction representation has a representation in which all terms are distinct. Bartels writes \"Takenouchi does not state the theorem itself but gives a proof to it. He uses the fact that the sum of the denominators of the representation increases and the fact that the number of representations of a given length is finite.  As far as I know this article has not been recognized in the meantime. I found some proofs (done in the 60s) which for example prove that n/m can be\nrepresented as a sum of n Egyptian fractions. This shows that the article is (was) quite unknown in mathematical literature.\"\n</BLOCKQUOTE><P>\n<A NAME=\"TY90\">[TY90]\n</A><BLOCKQUOTE>G. Tenenbaum and H. Yokota.
