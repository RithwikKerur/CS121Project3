Osterweil in Technical Report 94-023, \nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1994.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nUsing systematic development processes is an important characteristic of \nany mature engineering discipline. In current software practice, Software \nDesign Methodologies (SDMs) are intended to be used to help design \nsoftware more systematically. This paper explicitly shows, however, that \none well-known example of such an SDM, Booch Object Oriented Design (BOOD), \nas described in the literature is far too vague to provide specific guidance \nto designers, and is too imprecise and incomplete to be considered as a \nfully systematic process for specific projects. \n\n<P>\nTo provide more effective and appropriate guidance and control in software \ndesign processes, we applied the process programming concept to the design \nprocess. Given two different sets of plausible process requirements, we \nelaborated two more detailed and precise design processes that are \nresponsive to these requirements. We have also implemented, experimented \nwith, and evaluated a prototype (called Debus-Booch) that supports the \nexecution of these detailed processes.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 26 11:26:36 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
