Each localizer views an infinite wedge of the plane, and a\ndevice can prove membership in the secure region if it is inside the\nwedges for a set of localizers whose common intersection contains no\npoints outside the polygon. This model leads to a broad class of new art\ngallery type problems, for which we provide upper and lower bounds.\n<p>\n(Joint work by David Eppstein, Michael T.
