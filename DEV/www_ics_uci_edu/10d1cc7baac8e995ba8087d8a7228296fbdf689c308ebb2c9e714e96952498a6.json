(That is,\nthe fill ratio is 1). Each key is equally likely to be hashed to each\nslot, independently of the other keys. Let M be the maximum number of\nkeys in any slot after all the keys have been inserted. Your mission is\nto prove an O(log n / log log n) upper bound on E[M], the expected value\nof M.\n\n(a) Argue that the probability Q_k that exactly k keys hash to a\nparticular slot is given by\n    Q_k = (1/n)^k (1 - 1/n)^(n-k) (n choose k)\n(The last term is the binomial coefficient that counts the number of\ndistinct k-tuples that can be formed by n items; it equals n!/k!(n-k)!.)\n\n(b) Let P_k be the probability that M = k; that is, the probability that\nthe slot containing the most keys contains k keys. Show that P_k <= n Q_k.\n\n(c) Use Stirling's approximation to show that Q_k < e^k / k^k.\nStirling's approximation is:\n    n! = sqrt(2 pi n) (n/e)^n (1 + Theta(1/n))\nwhere e ~ 2.71828 is the base of the natural logarithm.\n\n(d) Show that there exists a constant c > 1 such that Q_k0 < 1/n^3\nfor k0 = c log n / log log n. Conclude that P_k < 1/n^2 for k >= k0.\n\n(e) By arguing that\n    E[M] <= n Pr[ M > c log n / log log n] +\n                (c log n / log log n) Pr[ M <= c log n / log log n],\nconclude that E[M] = O(log n / log log n).\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
