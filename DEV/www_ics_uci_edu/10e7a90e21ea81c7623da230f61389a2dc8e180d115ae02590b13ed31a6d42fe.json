The abstraction capabilities of process algebra provide an effective \nmeans to control state explosion in automated state-space analysis, but \nonly if a design is carefully modularized to encapsulate details of\nbehavior. This paper reports experience modifying an existing design (a \nremote temperature sensor system described by Sanden) to make it more \namenable to hierarchical analysis. Redesign for analysis was effective in \nimproving the design in other ways as well: Flaws uncovered in the analysis \n(and present in the original design) were easy to understand and correct \nbecause of the increased understandability of the revised design. This \nalso suggests that these flaws might have been avoided, and the design \ngenerally improved, had ``design for analysis'' been applied from the\nstart. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 27 13:36:13 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
