It's just like every other screening\r\n\t\tat Sundance: I'm waiting in line to get in, subject to the whim\r\n\t\tof an arbitrary doorman.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>I'm a filmmaker, but that doesn't help. You see, I'm an animator.\r\n\t\t(My film <I>Shaft of Light</I> is being screenedas part of Shorts Program V at Sundance.) And\r\n\t\tbecause I make short films (as opposed to features), I am not\r\n\t\tbustled through the crowd and past the doorman, but rather get\r\n\t\tto wait with the masses on the wrong side of the theater door.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Tonight, though, I get lucky. As a bald-faced publicity stunt,\r\n\t\tI carry around one of my actors -- an 18-inch-tall humanoid metal\r\n\t\tarmature -- with his arm slung through a loop on my backpack.\r\n\t\tAt this screening, as at all events here, if the right person\r\n\t\tlikes you, all doors open. The doorman likes my armature, I get\r\n\t\tto watch the premiere of <I>Gridlock'd</I> -- and I don't even have to pay seven bucks.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>The Sundance Film Festival is America's most prominent showcase\r\n\t\tof independent film. Directors, producers, actors, writers, distributors,\r\n\t\tcritics, reporters, sponsors and a whole array of dignitaries\r\n\t\tand other hangers-on accumulate in Park City for 10 days (or three\r\n\t\tdays, if you have to be in L.A. on Monday for a power meeting\r\n\t\twith Paramount, but I'll call you later this week. I promise.)</P>\r\n\t\t<P>During our time here (Sundance '97 finished up on Sunday), some\r\n\t\tof us ski, most watch films, and all schmooze. The most tragic\r\n\t\tcondition at Sundance is being alone. It means you must be nobody.\r\n\t\tTim Roth was the only person I've seen who was walking alone and\r\n\t\twasn't embarrassed about it (of course, he was fleeing the madding\r\n\t\tcrowd out front of the Egyptian Theater, where his movie had just\r\n\t\tpremiered).</P>\r\n\t\t<P>The threat of the fatal disease of solitude causes everyone here\r\n\t\tto talk incessantly, and avoid silence at all costs. The trick\r\n\t\tis to be seen talking to important people, so that other people\r\n\t\twill think that <I>you</I> must be important, and therefore they will come try to talk to\r\n\t\tyou.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>At Sundance's opening night screening, I accidentally sat down\r\n\t\tin what turned out to be the row reserved for the Sundance board\r\n\t\tof directors. In due course, Sally Field came and sat down next\r\n\t\tto me. After a few minutes, when she had dispensed with the obligatory\r\n\t\tgreetings pushed on her by just about everyone within three rows,\r\n\t\tshe turned to me.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>&quot;Hello. I'm Sally.&quot;</P>\r\n\t\t<P>&quot;Hello. I'm Bill. Nice to meet you,&quot; I replied, and we chatted\r\n\t\tabout the film we were about to see.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Now, it's not every day that a major film star introduces herself\r\n\t\tto a thoroughly un-famous, 24-year-old, just-recently-ex-student\r\n\t\tlike me. I thought through the possible explanations:</P>\r\n\t\t<P>1. She's an honest-to-goodness nice person.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>2. She figured that a guy my age in the board-of-directors row\r\n\t\tmust be <I>somebody</I>, or at least be closely related to <I>somebody</I>.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>In her defense, Sally Field is a big enough star that she doesn't\r\n\t\thave to kiss up to anyone, board of directors or not. So I guess\r\n\t\tthe answer is that she's just nice. All I know is that <I>I</I> didn't start the conversation.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>So why do thousands of people congregate annually to engage in\r\n\t\ta ritual of schmoozing and being schmoozed, snubbing and being\r\n\t\tsnubbed?</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Because it can make your future. If Bob Redford takes a shine\r\n\t\tto a first-time filmmaker, suddenly that filmmaker finds a plush\r\n\t\tbudget for his next film. Within an hour after my first screening,\r\n\t\tBravo (one of the cable TV channels that has people prowling the\r\n\t\tback alleys of Park City around this time of year) had a handwritten\r\n\t\tnote in my mailbox, asking me to call them to talk about &quot;a possible\r\n\t\tdeal.&quot; And if I see an actor I like, I'll remember him when I\r\n\t\tcast my next film.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>So we all come to Sundance to see the best of the year's indy\r\n\t\tfilm, to meet the right people, and (since most filmmakers are\r\n\t\tattention-starved artsy types like myself) to experience the rare\r\n\t\tthrill of a packed audience watching a movie that you spent so\r\n\t\tmuch of your damn life on that it makes you want to throw up just\r\n\t\tthinking about it.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Here are a few day-to-day observations on this year's festival,\r\n\t\taccumulated by this Sundance novice amidst a blizzard of movie\r\n\t\tstars, freebies and promises, promises, promises.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n\t\t<P><B>It's the movies, stupid</B></P>\r\n\t\t<P>This is why Sundance exists. I just saw the world premiere of\r\n\t\t<I>Nowhere</I>, a surreal, post-Generation-X teen flick by Gregg Araki. Sumptuous\r\n\t\tcolors, exotically beautiful young actors and a soundtrack as\r\n\t\tfar as I can imagine from the tunes playing in the basement Country\r\n\t\t&amp; Western bar where I now sit with my Hugo Boss note pad. (I have\r\n\t\tall sorts of stuff from sponsors and over-eager publicity people.)</P>\r\n\t\t<P>There seem to be two kinds of movies here: dramatic/compelling\r\n\t\tand innovative/exotic. (Well, three kinds, actually. Compelling,\r\n\t\texotic and good-old-fashioned crap, although I suppose one could\r\n\t\tparse the crap into poor attempts at the first two.) Although\r\n\t\tI have seen films that made me laugh, cry, hope, blah, blah, blah\r\n\t\t(category one), I much prefer the crazy flair of films like <I>Nowhere</I>. The film moved blithely from a girl flirting with twin blonde\r\n\t\tAdonises named Surf and Ski to a buff, leather-clad cycle-rider\r\n\t\tbeating a young punk's face in with a can of tomato soup.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>It was all that, <I>and </I>a bag of chips.</P>\r\n\t\t<CENTER>\r\n\t\t\t<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n\t\t</CENTER>\r\n\t\t<P><B>Why are film directors such freaks?</B></P>\r\n\t\t<P>As a budding director, I often feel the urge to act strange. I\r\n\t\twant to put my hair up in a topknot and walk around with mud smeared\r\n\t\ton my face, or call Information and ask them the molecular weight\r\n\t\tof NaCl. And, as I already mentioned, I have been wandering around\r\n\t\tPark City for six days with a metal-and-hot-glue homunculus clinging\r\n\t\tto my backpack.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Why? I guess because movie directors and actors are <I>supposed</I> to be freaks. An accountant who suddenly dyed his hair blue and\r\n\t\tshaved the word &quot;TAX&quot; in his beard would be avoided by his peers,\r\n\t\tbut society provides a certain loophole for creatives. We're expected\r\n\t\tto be different, so we fulfill our role by acting up. When the\r\n\t\t6 o'clock news displays the antics of some whiny film star, it\r\n\t\tencourages the very weirdness it seems to condemn. </P>\r\n\t\t<P>(This rant inspired by a bit part played by Robert Downey, Jr.\r\n\t\tin the film <I>Hugo Pool</I> directed by Robert Downey, Sr. The younger Robert Downey plays\r\n\t\ta zany, egocentric director who has shot an extra for over-acting.\r\n\t\t&quot;Thank god we're in L.A.,&quot; he says, or he'd never have gotten\r\n\t\toff.)</P>\r\n\t\t<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n\t\t<P><B>Cheap eats</B></P>\r\n\t\t<P>So far I've paid for one meal in nine days. We live on hors d'oeuvres\r\n\t\tand free Absolut (one of the corporate sponsors). Starbucks has\r\n\t\tset up a free coffee stand in the Sundance Channel office, for\r\n\t\tthose in the know, so I've had quite a few complimentary vanilla\r\n\t\tsteamers (steamed milk with vanilla syrup). Very soothing.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Dinner tonight should be provided by the Kodak party. They'll\r\n\t\thave food and drink to court us into using Kodak film stock. I'm\r\n\t\ta confirmed Fuji-shooter, but I wouldn't want to hurt Kodak's\r\n\t\tfeelings, now would I?</P>\r\n\t\t<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n\t\t<P><B>&quot;So what do you do?&quot;</B></P>\r\n\t\t<P>These last few days have been the first time in my life that I've\r\n\t\tbeen scared of talking to a beautiful woman (of whom there are\r\n\t\tmany) more because of <I>who she probably is</I> than simply because she is a beautiful woman. I'll be chatting\r\n\t\twith a friend and he'll point out someone across the room. At\r\n\t\tall other times in my life, said companion might say &quot;Damn, she's\r\n\t\thot!&quot; Here my comrade offers &quot;She's an agent.&quot; As if her perfect\r\n\t\tblondeness weren't intimidating enough...</P>\r\n\t\t<P>I spend a lot of time talking to the hired help.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n\t\t<P><B>Hard cell</B></P>\r\n\t\t<P>At the opening night party, a woman dissed a guy to take a call\r\n\t\ton her cell phone. Before every screening, there is a request\r\n\t\tby a staff member that audience members please turn off their\r\n\t\tcell phones. The Executive Business Center rents them for what\r\n\t\tI'm sure is an exorbitant amount. The expense pales, though, when\r\n\t\tyou read of the films being picked up by distributors for $3 million\r\n\t\tbecause of deals made on cell phones. When I made the Bravo deal\r\n\t\t(yes, it's gone from &quot;possible&quot; to probable), I was on a pay phone\r\n\t\t-- but I'll bet the Bravo guy was on his cell phone.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n\t\t<P><B>Roger Ebert goes ballistic</B></P>\r\n\t\t<P>I went to a panel discussion on the future of cyberspace, featuring\r\n\t\tWilliam Gibson, Douglas Adams, John Perry Barlow and Paulina Borsook.\r\n\t\tAbout 20 minutes into it, the movie critic Roger Ebert, who was\r\n\t\tsitting about five seats from me, barked out that they were talking\r\n\t\tabout things that had already happened and that we all already\r\n\t\tknew, and uttered a curt request that they start talking about\r\n\t\tthe <I>future</I> of cyberspace as that was the title of the panel. To thunderous\r\n\t\taudience applause, the panelists shifted their discussion to the\r\n\t\tfuture.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>But then a few people in the crowd felt it was their right to\r\n\t\tbark out commands, too. The panel turned into an inane Q &amp; A.\r\n\t\tMost of the audience was annoyed by the nobodies putting in their\r\n\t\ttwo cents. I sat and tried to figure out why Roger Ebert is applauded\r\n\t\tfor chiming in, but anyone else is shut down. </P>\r\n\t\t<P>Best quote: &quot;We will all be immigrants in a land where our children\r\n\t\twill be natives -- cyberspace.&quot;<I>--John Parry Barlow</I></P>\r\n\t\t<P>Runner-up: &quot;We don't know who discovered water, but we're pretty\r\n\t\tsure it wasn't a fish.&quot;<I>--William Gibsonquoting unknown.</I></P>\r\n\t\t<CENTER>\r\n\t\t\t<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n\t\t</CENTER>\r\n\t\t<P><B>Sun, Slam, Slum</B></P>\r\n\t\t<P>Sundance is a terribly exclusive film festival. So, three years\r\n\t\tago, a bunch of directors whose films were refused by Sundance\r\n\t\tstarted their own festival, which takes place in Park City at\r\n\t\tthe same time. They consider themselves the alternative to the\r\n\t\talternative (since Sundance was set up to be the independent alternative\r\n\t\tto Hollywood studio filmmaking) -- and now their festival has\r\n\t\tbecome nearly as hard to crack as Sundance.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Not to be outdone, a group of filmmakers who didn't feel they\r\n\t\tbelonged with Sundance <I>or </I>Slamdance started their own gig: Slumdance. About a month before\r\n\t\tthe other two festivals were to begin, Slumdance put up a Website\r\n\t\tand started collecting films for an impromptu bunch of screenings\r\n\t\tand parties to take place in an as-yet-to-be-determined location\r\n\t\tin Park City. After a couple of weeks, they secured an abandoned\r\n\t\tMrs. Field's Cookie Factory on Main Street, right in the middle\r\n\t\tof everything. They bought out a thrift store in Salt Lake City\r\n\t\tand created the &quot;Slum,&quot; a hodgepodge of tents, potato chips and\r\n\t\tvideocassettes in their new home. They welcome everyone with free\r\n\t\tsoup and no stress.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>So will there be an alternative to the alternative to the alternative\r\n\t\tto the alternative next year?</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Slimchance.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>&nbsp;</P>\r\n\t\t<P><B>Who wins?</B></P>\r\n\t\t<P>Well, <I>Shaft of Light</I> didn't win any awards. A film called <I>Man About Town</I> by Kris Isacsson and Matt Gunn took best short film. (Some consolation,\r\n\t\tthough -- actress Sandra Bullock, whose directorial debut was\r\n\t\talso featured in the short film competition, didn't win anything\r\n\t\teither.)</P>\r\n\t\t<P>But with all the prizes flying about in Park City (Sundance has\r\n\t\tprizes, Slamdance has prizes, even Slumdance has prizes -- including\r\n\t\tone called the Golden Rat), who really wins? I suppose it depends\r\n\t\ton what game you're playing.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Some wins are concrete, others ephemeral. A few directors leave\r\n\t\there with lump sums in their pockets. Actors leave with roles\r\n\t\tin new films. But everyone scored something; a phone number of\r\n\t\tan agent, a promise that a producer will read your script, a set\r\n\t\tof contracts that &quot;will be faxed to you on Monday.&quot; These might\r\n\t\tbe the most important thing to happen in a young artist's life,\r\n\t\tbut more than likely they will wash out. You make 10 best friends\r\n\t\tat the festival for each follow-up call that will be returned.\r\n\t\tPeople rave about your film, and then won't say hi when you pass\r\n\t\tthem in the street. Some people in the industry are just plain\r\n\t\tmean, and probably enjoy the opportunity to destroy the enthusiasm\r\n\t\tof us neophytes, but most people here are just looking out for\r\n\t\ttheir own interests as best they can. What more can you expect?</P>\r\n\t\t<P>So we'll all go back to L.A., New York, Paris, Rome, Philadelphia,\r\n\t\tKansas and Japan, and see if anything actually pans out. Maybe\r\n\t\tI'll be the big discovery of Sundance 1997. Or, more likely, the\r\n\t\tlast 10 days will be just a step in the right direction for my\r\n\t\tcareer as a filmmaker. A thousand more steps just like it, and\r\n\t\tthen I'll be somebody, too. Doormen will recognize me, and I'll\r\n\t\tbe invited to all the parties. Until then, I remain a 24-year-old\r\n\t\tanimator, waiting in line in the snow, with a little metal figure\r\n\t\thanging from my back.</P>\r\n\t\t<P>This just in: the Bravo contract I'd been promised by Monday has\r\n\t\tstill not arrived. Maybe I should stop holding my breath.</P>\r\n\t</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
