likewise, there is no way that you can\r\n  learn all this material starting now (I'm assuming that you've been learning\r\n  it during the entire quarter).\r\n<p>\r\nTherefore, you should concentrate on reviewing the most important analysis and\r\n  synthesis skills that we have studied.\r\nUse the quizzes (and to a lesser extent the programming assignments and daily\r\n  homework assignments) as a guide for what material is of primary importance.\r\nUnderstand the material on its own terms, and how to use this material when\r\n  writing code.\r\n<p>\r\nMy written exams are not designed to determine if you understand obscure\r\n   material; instead, they are designed to determine if you understand\r\n  important material, and can use your knowledge to understand and answer\r\n  questions <b>quickly</b>.\r\nMy exams are long (some students will not finish them): it you don't\r\n  immediately know the answer to a question, skip it, and come back to it\r\n  later, if you have time (sometimes working problems later in the exam will\r\n  remind you of something relevant to the answer to earlier questions).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Important:</b>Recall  that the final exam can also cover topics from the\r\n   first half of the course.\r\n   I would suggest reviewing the the earlier quizzes and midterm exam.\r\n   Fundamentally, the second \"half\" of the quarter dealt with writing classes,\r\n     using arrays, and using interfaces.\r\n   Here is a <a href=\"writtenexam1.html\">Topics from the first half\r\n     of the class</a> link.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Outline of Lecture Topics</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Static Methods<ul>\r\n  <li>Definitions (including parameter/argument terminology)\r\n  <li>The <b>return</b> statement\r\n  <li>Hand simulation via call frames (primitive and reference variables)\r\n  <li>Constant/final parameters\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Writing Static Methods in Classes<ul>\r\n  <li>The main method\r\n  <li>Writing methods in applications\r\n  <li>Writing methods in libraries (like <b>SUM</b>)\r\n  <li>Throwing exceptions with <b>String</b> arguments indicating the problem:\r\n         e.g., <b>IllegalArgumentException</b>, <b>IllegalStateException</b>\r\n  <li>Eclipse tools (editor/debugger) and their connection to <b>static</b>\r\n        methods\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Writing Classes<ul>\r\n  <li>Defining constructors, methods, fields\r\n  <li>Name conflicts (between parameters/locals and instance variables) and\r\n       the meaning and uses of <b>this</b>.\r\n  <li>Writing constuctors (name conflicts, the special use of <b>this</b>)\r\n  <li>Writing methods (illustrating <b>this</b>, the implicit parameter, in\r\n        call frames) \r\n  <li>Defining fields: instance variables vs. static fields;
