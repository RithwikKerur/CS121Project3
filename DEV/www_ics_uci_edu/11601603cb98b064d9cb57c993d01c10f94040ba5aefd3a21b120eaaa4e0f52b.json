It could involve handling of errors from attached hardware\nor any other software component. However, it is not always possible to re-create all error\nsituations and test them. One of the mechanisms for testing the robustness of the code is\nto inject errors and ensure that the code paths are covered. </p>\n\n<p>This project will provide an opportunity for students to develop a GUI interface to\ninject various errors in a client server environment. This will allow them to verify the\nerror recovery code in the client and the handling of invalid commands in the server. It\nwill also provide an opportunity for them to get an experience in inter process\ncommunications.</p>\n<b>\n\n<h2>Background</b></h2>\n\n<p>In any computer system the Input Output system is an essential element. All I/Os have\nto be performed on attached devices. The IOPs written in the system have to handle various\nerror conditions possibly returned by these devices. In the Tandem Non-Stop fault tolerant\nsystems error recovery is one of the most critical areas of the code. We have to be able\nto tolerate any single point of failure without impacting the customer applications. Thus,\nit is essential for us to be able to test these various error situations.</p>\n\n<p>One of the mechanisms to test these error conditions is to develop and use an error\ninjector tool. This would provide the capability to inject any error from a normal device\ninstead of trying to find devices that are broken and return various error conditions. </p>\n<b>\n\n<h2>Proposal</b></h2>\n\n<p>To limit the scope of this project and to remove any dependence on a hardware\ncomponent, it is being proposed that a client server environment be used. Here are the\nvarious components of the project: \n\n<ol TYPE=\"a\">\n  <li>A client that creates and sends messages for the server. (To simulate the operations\n    performed by the IOPs it is suggested that the messages use the standard SCSI structures.\n    This will also introduce the students to the SCSI terminology)</li>\n  <li>A server that processes the messages from the client and replies to these messages.</li>\n  <li>A GUI based error injection tool that injects errors specified by the user. It sends\n    messages to the client to alter either the outgoing message to the server or incoming\n    reply from the server. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>By altering the outgoing message to the server, a normal command is changed and made\n    invalid without changing the client software. This will test the behavior of the server\n    and ensure that it can handle invalid commands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>By altering the incoming response from the server, a normal reply is changed without\n    changing the server software. The client believes that the response from the server\n    indicates an error condition. This will validate and verify the error recovery code in the\n    client software.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a HREF=\"projects.html\">ICS125 WQ00 Project Opportunities<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"../ics125.html\">ICS125 WQ00<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
