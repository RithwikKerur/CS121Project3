This inquiry is especially interesting to me as I \r\nremember Gladys Henerson vaguely from Temple Sinai in Oakland. I really\r\ndidn't know her, but her husband, Morris, was my religious school teacher\r\none year. You mentioned a son Stan. I remember their older son, James.\r\n\r\nMorrie Henerson was also the executive director of Temple Sinai, so I just\r\nphoned the Temple office. They connected me to the cemetery. Gladys is\r\nburied at Home of Eternity, 500 Piedmont Avenue, Oakland 94611.\r\nThe woman I spoke with (Rhonda) said they do not have any info on\r\nGlady's parents.  And since Temple Sinai is reform, I have a feeling\r\nthat there may not be any Hebrew on the gravestone.\r\nI told the woman that I had known the family, and she said that she did, too.\r\nI said I remembered their son, Jimmy. She said, \"We're in touch in with\r\nJimmy.\" I said I went on the web and got 2 southern Calif. addresses for\r\nJames Henerson. She said, \"Oh, from the film website?\" I said no, from\r\ntelephone listings. She said she couldn't reveal the address. I said which\r\none do you like best , Santa Barbara or Sherman Oaks? She said,\"Sherman\r\nOaks.\"  So here is Jimmy's address and Phone:\r\n\r\nJames Henerson\r\n15300 Kingswood Lane\r\nSherman Oaks, CA 91403\r\n\r\nPhone # 818-981-5893\r\n\r\nI did a web search, and James is apparently a writer for some TV shows\r\nand various films.\r\n\r\nIf you phone him, you can mention my name (and my brother Don Rubin)\r\nif you wish, though I don't think he would remember me. I think he's about\r\n4 years younger than I am. I'm 68. Maybe it's best not to mention that \r\nRhonda told me which town. Just say I remembered the name James,\r\nand that I (or you) did a web search for Calif. James Henersons.\r\n\r\nI'll find out the address to get the death certificate.\r\n\r\nI'll really be interested to know if I was sitting in synagogue with an einicle\r\nof Rebbe Elimelech! Even as a young child, I felt the connection with the ages.\r\n\r\nFor maybe a year, Irwin Spira was director of the religious school. At the\r\ntime I had no knowledge of the significance of the name Spira. I've not seen\r\nhis name since.\r\n\r\nTo be continued.\r\n\r\nMarian\r\n  \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nDate: Wed, 23 Oct 2002 22:56:02 -0400\r\nTo: MERUBIN@aol.com\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Gladys Henerson-Oakland\r\n\r\nWow!\r\n\r\nTalk about a needle in a haystack.

I have never even been \r\nable to locate her grave which is somewhere in Pittsburg.\r\n\r\nThe only information I have is that the family lived in the \r\nPittsburg area and moved to San Francisco after a flood devastated \r\ntheir (furniture) business-probably the St. Patrick's Day Flood of \r\n1936. Anna's brothers were Paul, Philip and Sam. She also had a \r\nsister named Rose. I don't have any additional information, so I \r\ndon't know if I fit somewhere into the descendants of Pesach, or \r\nnot. \r\n\r\nI would be grateful for any information you have concerning my \r\ngrandmother or any of her siblings. I have checked many websites \r\nincluding ancestry.com and familysearch.org but I haven't gotten any \r\ngood leads. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: moishe@langsam.com [mailto:moishe@langsam.com] \r\nSent: Monday, July 26, 2004 2:50 PM\r\nTo: Michelle Neiman\r\nSubject: H4 Langsam family\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nTonight begins the Jewish fast of \"Tisha B'Av\" (the ninth\r\nday of Av), which marks the destruction of both Temples in\r\nJewish History. I will be home tomorrow afternoon and you\r\ncan try me in NY at 718-258-5512 after 4pm. \r\n\r\nIn the interim, let me try to outline some of your family.\r\nYour grandmother (whose Hebrew name was Charna) came here\r\non August 14, 1912 via the port of Antwerp together with\r\nher brother Philip (Hebrew name Pinchus) and sister Rose\r\n(Hebrew name Chula). She was nine years old.

If you\r\nlike, I can put you in touch with your cousin Rose in San\r\nFrancisco. \r\n\r\nPlease share any more detail on your own genealogy with me.\r\nWho did your father, Harold Neiman, marry? How many\r\nchildren were there (including you)? Can you provide any\r\nmore detail on your own family?\r\n\r\nPlease stay in touch,\r\nMoishe \r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Michelle Neiman\" <mneiman@cpcourt.summitoh.net> \r\nSubject: RE: H4 Langsam family \r\nDate: Mon, 26 Jul 2004 15:03:04 -0400 \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\n  \r\nThank you so much for the information!

The only information the death certificate provided \r\nwas that her body was returned to Pittsburgh by hearse. I found that \r\nunusual since most travel was by train back then. No one in the \r\nfamily seems to know where she could be buried. It is no small task \r\nsince there are about 400 jewish burial areas in the Pittsburgh \r\narea. I have looked 3-4 times to narrow the search. Some are \r\nactually just a few headstones in between houses. I will keep \r\nlooking. I may also try to find her marriage record since that might \r\nindicate the congregation she belonged to, which might help narrow \r\nmy search. \r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Michelle Neiman\" <mneiman@cpcourt.summitoh.net> \r\nDate: Mon, 26 Jul 2004 16:00:50 -0400 \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nOnce again, I want to thank you for the information. I really can't\r\nexpress what it means. I am named after my grandmother-my middle \r\nname is Langsam-so I have searched a long, long time to find out \r\nsomething about my family. You have handed me the missing pieces!\r\n\r\nAnna Langsam married William Neiman aka Wolf Neumann. They lived in\r\nAkron, Ohio. She gave birth to my father Harold Neiman on July 1, \r\n1926 and died 22 days later on July 23, 1926. She was buried in \r\nPittsburg somewhere supposedly with her mother, and an aunt. ( I \r\nhave never been able to locate the graves but I have renewed hope \r\nnow.) My grandfather remarried (third wife actually, Anna was the \r\nsecond wife!) The new wife was also called Anna. Together they had \r\nfour more children-my father's half-siblings. \r\n\r\nMy father Harold Neiman married Hazel \"Casey\" Kline. I am one of \r\nthree daughters: Karyn Lynne Neiman born 1963, Lori Ann Neiman born \r\n1965, died 1988. I am Michelle Langsam Neiman born 1967.\r\n\r\nMy sister also lives in Akron and is married to John Goldsmith. They \r\nhave two daughters-Allison and Victoria. \r\n\r\nI barely remember both my older and younger \"aunt\" roses who used to \r\nvisit us in Akron, Ohio. We also visited them in San Francisco at \r\nthe apartment building on Funston Street. It is good to hear that \r\nthe younger Rose is still living but it is my understanding that she \r\ndoes not want to hear from my part of the family and has been \r\nreluctant to share family history in the past, so I don't think I \r\nwill travel down that road.\r\n\r\nI am very excited to continue my family research. You have opened \r\nmany doors! I will try to call you one evening this week to speak in \r\nperson, and that will give you a day or two to update the family \r\ninformation. I am eternally grateful. Thanks again. Take care. \r\n  \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: moishe@langsam.com [mailto:moishe@langsam.com] \r\nSent: Tuesday, July 27, 2004 10:22 AM\r\nTo: Michelle Neiman\r\nSubject: Re: PA Death Records\r\n\r\nWhat are the names of her parents on her death certificate?\r\nWhat other info is there on it?\r\n\r\nMoishe  \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Michelle Neiman\" <mneiman@cpcourt.summitoh.net> \r\nSubject: RE: PA Death Records \r\nDate: Tue, 27 Jul 2004 11:08:22 -0400 \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\n \r\n\r\nI will have to check with my sister.

The Mid-Atlantic Region is\r\nthe repository for federal documents considered permanently \r\nvaluable.  Federal agencies and U.S. Courts in the states of \r\nDelaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia have \r\ncreated the records that we hold.  \r\n\r\nThe National Archives is the repository of naturalization records \r\nfor the Federal District and Circuit Courts.  The indexes for the\r\nFederal Courts in the Western District of PA were searched for the\r\nyears 1906-1926.   Jakob Langsom was found.  To receive copies of\r\nthe naturalization papers, provide us with your postal mailing\r\naddress.  Please send a check or money order for $10.00 made out to\r\nNATFB and mail to our address listed below.  Once we receive\r\npayment we will forward the copies.\r\n\r\nBefore September 22, 1922, females of any age and males under age 18\r\nwere naturalized under their husband's or father's petition. \r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nGail E.
