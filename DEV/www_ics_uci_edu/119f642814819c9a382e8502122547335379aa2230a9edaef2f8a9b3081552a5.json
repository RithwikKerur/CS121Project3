but I am not counting blank lines norlines \r\n    filled with comments.\r\n  My \"big collatz\" program is 24 lines; my \"dice ewar\" program is 72 lines; my\r\n    \"phone database\" program is 37 lines; my \"heart monitor\" program is 67\r\n    lines.\r\n  Your programs might be smaller, and they might be larger; but if your program\r\n    starts going over 2-3 times the size of mine, you might want to rethink it\r\n    (or come get some help).\r\n  <p>\r\n  Please follow the instructions below for each program: finish each\r\n    enhancement before continuing to the next one (including printing\r\n    whatever messages it displays in the console, copied exactly).\r\n  <p>\r\n  The  <a href=\"../../programs/classexamples.zip\">Class Examples</a> program\r\n    illustrates the use of many classes, including the ones that you will need\r\n    to use in this assignment.\r\n  The last two programs require writing nested loops: one loop inside another.\r\n  I used multiple <b>break</b> statements inside some of these loops.\r\n  <p>\r\n  To work on this assignment, create one Java project (call it <b>Program4</b>)\r\n    and create four new Java classes in it.\r\n  Each class will contain a program that you will write to solve one problem;\r\n    name the classes <b>BigCollatz</b>, <b>DiceWar</b>, <b>PhoneDatabase</b>,\r\n    and <b>ICD</b>.\r\n  Write, run, and debug each class/program as you did in Program #3.\r\n  When you finish each part, submit its <b>.java</b> file.\r\n  <p>\r\n  <b>Only one programmer of the pair should dropoff the programs: the same one\r\n       for each part.\r\n     It doesn't matter which of the pair submits, but that person should\r\n       submit all the parts.\r\n     Of course, each program should contain both student names (in the\r\n        comment: the same one you cut, pasted, ane filled in at the top of\r\n        each program in <a href=\"../program1/program.html\">Program #1</a>).</b>\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Big Collatz -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"BigCollatz\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Collatz with BigInteger</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  Don't start this project with the new project folder.\r\n  Instead, download the <a href=\"Program4.zip\">Program4</a>\r\n    project folder, unzip it, and start a new project in Eclipse using\r\n    this project folder (which contains a <b>Collatz.java</b> program\r\n    that works for <b>int</b> values).\r\n  Create the <b>DiceWar</b> and <b>PhoneDatabase</b> classes here.\r\n  <p>\r\n  When compiled and run, the <b>Collatz.java</b> class prompts the user for an\r\n    <b>int</b> value and performs the Collatz process (read the comments for\r\n    all the details) on that number until it is \"reduced\" to 1.\r\n  We have seen this program before, when working with the Eclipse Debugger.\r\n  <p>\r\n  This program requires you to use objects constructed from the\r\n     <b>BigInteger</b> class; remember to import it.\r\n  <p>\r\n  For this programming assignment, enhance this program to use variables that\r\n     refer to <b>BigInteger</b> objects rather than store <b>int</b>\r\n     primitives.\r\n  In this way, there is almost no limit on the size of number that we can apply\r\n    the Collatz process to, checking whether all values are ultimately reduced\r\n    to 1 (which happens for all examples I've tried, and happens very quickly).\r\n  <p>\r\n  Fundamentally what you are doing in this program is translating from the\r\n    use of primitive types and values to the use of reference types and\r\n    objects.\r\n  This is a good starting point for switching to object-oriented programming.\r\n  It will involve importing the <b>BigInteger</b> class (see Javadoc for its\r\n    full name, including its package).\r\n  In addition, you should...\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Use constructors for <b>BigInteger</b> objects to initialize\r\n        variables/constants, instead of using <b>int</b> literals\r\n        -there are no <b>BigInteger</b> literals!\r\n      Also note that the <b>BigInteger</b> class declares some\r\n        <b>public final</b> constants which you should find useful.\r\n  <li>Use methods like <b>.divide</b>, <b>.multiply</b>, and <b>.add</b> to\r\n        perform arithmetic on <b>BigInteger</b> values (instead of using\r\n        arithmetic operators -they do not work for <b>BigInteger</b> values).\r\n      Note that there are no state-change operators for <b>BigInteger</b> \r\n        objects (e.g., no <b>++</b>): like <b>String</b>, it is an immutable\r\n        class.\r\n  <li>Use methods like <b>.equals</b> and/or <b>.compareTo</b> to compare\r\n      <b>BigInteger</b> values (instead of using relational operators: remember\r\n      that <b>==</b> probably doesn't do what you want done!)\r\n  </ul>\r\n  Check the <b>Prompt</b> class for a useful input method.\r\n  You should also make good use of cascaded method calls in your solution\r\n    (taking the place of subexpressions and operator precendence).\r\n  <p>\r\n  Submit your final program (test it on small numbers, and big numbers: numbers\r\n    with tens or hundreds of digits).\r\n  Finally, remember to update the <b>Description:</b> comment to describe\r\n    the changes added to the program.\r\n  <p>\r\n  PS: With a perfect understanding of <b>BigInteger</b> converting this program\r\n    would take about 5 minutes: I guess you will take longer, because you will\r\n    learn a lot about the <b>BigInteger</b> class, specifically, and\r\n    understanding how to use objects, generally.\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Dice War -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"DiceWar\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Dice War</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  This program requires you to use objects constructed from the\r\n     <b>DiceEnsemble</b> and <b>Timer</b> classes; remember to import them.\r\n  Write a program that simulates playing games of dice war; the program should\r\n    also collect certain statistics while it is playing these games and report\r\n    them after the required number of games have been played.\r\n  In a game of dice war, each player starts out with his/her own dice ensemble,\r\n    consisting of (2,6-sided) dice, and some number (entered by the user) of\r\n    chips.\r\n  Each player roles his/her dice.\r\n  If one player's pip sum is higher, that player gets a chip from the other\r\n    player.\r\n  Whenever one player has no chips left, the game is over (and that player\r\n    has lost; and the other player has won).\r\n  So there are many plays (throws of the dice) in each game.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Your program must prompt the user for the number of games to play, and the\r\n    number of chips with which the players start each game.\r\n  It also prompts the user to determine if the program's behavior is to be\r\n    traced (use tracing as a debugging technique, only when playing few games).\r\n  The program then simulates that many games of dice war, using objects\r\n    constructed from the <b>DiceEnsemble</b> class: one pair of dice for each\r\n    player.\r\n  It keeps track of the number of times each player wins, the length (number of\r\n    dice rolls) of the shortest and longest games, and the total number of dice\r\n    rolls (over all the games).\r\n  It also uses a <b>Timer</b> to keep track of how long (in clock-time) it\r\n    takes to play all the games.\r\n  Try to use the <b>DiceEnsemble</b> objects themselves to keep track of some\r\n    of the required information, so you do not have to declare extra variables.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Ultimately the program prints \r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>how often each player won (it is a fair game, so these\r\n           numbers should be about equal)\r\n    <li>the length of the shortest and longest games\r\n    <li>the total number of rolls (over all games)\r\n    <li>the average number of rolls per game\r\n    <li>the amount of time it took to simulate all the games\r\n    <li>the simulation speed (number of games per second)\r\n  </ul>\r\n  Finally, the program should also be capable of tracing its events.\r\n  Such a facility is not used for long simulations, but instead it is very\r\n    useful for short debugging runs.\r\n  By tracing every important event in the simulation, we can display\r\n    information useful for spotting bugs.\r\n  When you build your program, you should trace the following events (if the\r\n    user requests a trace)\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>starting a new game\r\n    <li>playing one roll: indicate what each player rolled and how many chips\r\n          each player has left after the roll (and redistribution of the\r\n          chips).\r\n     <li>winning a game\r\n </ul>\r\n  Run my executable with tracing (for a small number of games), with each\r\n    person starting out with 3-5 chips) and without tracing (for a large\r\n    number of games, with increasing number of starting chips) to observe\r\n    all its behavior.\r\n  <p>\r\n  For this assignment, try to work out your own enhancements.\r\n  A starting point could be writing a program to play one game (with the user\r\n    supplying the number of starting chips); then add tracing; then add playing\r\n    multiple games (with the user supplying the number); then add code for\r\n    keeping all the statistics; then add timing the game.\r\n  Explore the Javadoc of the <b>DiceEnsemble</b> and <b>Timer</b> classes, and\r\n    use them effectively to minimize the variables and code you must write.\r\n  I found <b>Integer.MAX_VALUE</b> (check out this <b>static final</b> field in\r\n    the <b>Integer</b> wrapper class in Javadoc) useful as an initialization\r\n    for computing the smallest-length game, although there are many other\r\n    ways to compute this value correctly.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Phone Database -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"PhoneDatabase\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Phone Database</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  This program requires you to use objects constructed from the\r\n     <b>TypedBufferReader</b> and <b>StringTokenizer</b> classes\r\n     (as well as use of the <b>EOFException</b> class); remember to import\r\n     them.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Write a program that reads a database of names and their associated phone\r\n    numbers (from a file, catenating them into one huge <b>String</b>).\r\n  As a debugging check (leave it in your program; it is in my executable too),\r\n    ask the user if he/she wants to print the database (to see if it has been\r\n    read correctly); if so, print the <b>String</b>.\r\n  Then, it repeatedly prompts the user for a name (again, a <b>String</b>)\r\n    and look up and print its associated phone number (or print that the name\r\n    cannot be found) in the database.\r\n  If the user enter the \"name\" <b>QUIT</b>, whether upper-, lower-, or\r\n    mixed-case, the program should instead terminate.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Your program must prompt the user for an input file (see the file\r\n    <b>phoneinput.txt</b> provided with the executable) and then read all the\r\n    names and phone numbers from that file (each is read as a <b>String</b>)\r\n    from that file, catenating them into one large database string (with a\r\n    space between every name and phone number).\r\n  Then your program should repeatedly prompt the user for a name, and terminate\r\n    if the user enters <b>QUIT</b>; if the user enters any other name, use a\r\n     loop to process a <b>StringTokenizer</b> object (initialized to the\r\n     database): it should process tokens until the name is found (use a\r\n     case-insensitive equality comparison; then the next token is the phone \r\n     number) or there are no more tokens (then the name was not in the\r\n     database).\r\n  <p>\r\n  Note that the <a href=\"../../programs/classexamples.zip\">Class Examples</a>\r\n    program illustrates how to read all the values from a file, and how to\r\n    process all the tokens in a <b>String</b>; study this code and adapt it to\r\n    this program.\r\n  This resulting program is pretty small; it requires file reading (see above),\r\n    and ensures that you understand how to use the <b>StringTokenizer</b>\r\n    class (which has a constructor and a few useful methods that you must\r\n    learn to use).\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ICD\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Implantable Cardiac Defibrillators</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  Write a program that simulates the working of an \r\n    <a href=\"http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/5951/5951.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n      Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator</a> (ICD).\r\n  An ICD is a small electronic device placed in the chest cavity of a patient\r\n    who is suffering from arrhythmias (heartbeat irregularities).\r\n  This device constantly monitors the electrical output of a beating heart:\r\n    if it detects a bradycardia (heart beating too slowly) it acts a pacemaker;\r\n     more importantly, if it detects a tachycardia (heart beating too fast to\r\n     pump blood effectively: in extreme cases this results in  ventricular\r\n     fibrillation) at which point it acts as a defibrillator by supplying a\r\n     large shock to the heart in an attempt to restore a normal rhythm.\r\n    This shock is described by patients as feeling like a kick in the chest\r\n      -although many patients are unconscious by the time action is taken on\r\n     the detected arrhythmia.\r\n  If you are interested, you can read more detailed information on \r\n   <a href=\"http://www.medicinenet.com/implantable_cardiac_defibrillator/article.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n    ICDs</a>.\r\n  <p>\r\n  The basic algorithm inside an ICD computes the zero-crossing count (ZCC) of\r\n    the electical signals it samples while it is monitoring a heart.\r\n  Each signal should be between the value of <b>-100</b> and <b>+100</b> \r\n    inclusive (if not, the ICD is receiving faulty signals, and it should shut\r\n    itself off).\r\n  During an interval (typically lasting a few seconds), whenever the signal\r\n    value goes from positive to negative or negative to positive, the ICD\r\n    increments its ZCC.\r\n  For the purposes of this assignment, we will treat 0 as a positive number.\r\n  At the end of an interval, the ICD checks to see whether its ZCC is within a\r\n    normal range: in a bradycardia the ZCC is too low (equals or falls below\r\n    some threshold); in a tachycardia the ZCC is to high (equals or exceeds\r\n    some threshold).\r\n  If the ICD detects either of these conditions it takes the necessary action;\r\n    then it resets the ZCC and samples the heart signals for another interval.\r\n  Of course, real ICDs have evolved to exhibit much more sophisticated\r\n    behaviors, but this simple model is good enough for this programming\r\n    assignment.\r\n  <p>\r\n  For example, if the ICD is using an interval length of <b>10</b>, the\r\n    following table labels each sample, shows the signal value for that sample,\r\n    and the current ZCC.\r\n  <b><pre>Sample# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 ...\r\nSignal  0  5 10  5 -5  5 10  5 -5 -5  5 10  5 -5  5 -5 10  5 -5  5  5 10 ...\r\nZCC     0  0  0  0  1  2  2  2  3  3  1  1  1  2  3  4  5  5  6  7  0  0 ... \r\nZCC reset to 0----------------------^-----------------------------^----- ...</pre></b>\r\n  For example, between sample #4 and #5, the signal goes from <b>-5</b> to\r\n    <b>5</b> so the ZCC is incremented.\r\n  The ZCC at sample #10 (the end of the first interval) is <b>3</b> (after\r\n    which it is reset to <b>0</b> but immediately incremented to <b>1</b>\r\n     because between sample #10 and #11 the signal goes from <b>-5</b> to\r\n     <b>5</b>); at the end of the second interval it has risen to <b>7</b>.\r\n  <p>\r\n  This program will simulate the simple ICD algorithmg, allowing us to test it\r\n    on various data files that represent samples taken of the actual\r\n    electrical signals of a monitored heart.\r\n  It should operate as follows\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Prompt the user for the name of the ICD's configuration data file\r\n         (an input file), and the name of the simulated heart data file to\r\n         monitor (an input file).<br>\r\n        The configuration file specifies three <b>int</b> values: an example\r\n          would look like <b>100 15 25</b>:\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>The interval length: how many signals to read from the data file\r\n                while computing each ZCC; after these many signals, the ICD\r\n                decides if the heart is arrythmic and resets the ZCC.\r\n              It continues reading more signals, deciding whether or not the\r\n                heart is arrythmic every interval length.\r\n          <li>The bradycardia threshold: if the ZCCs in a an interval equals or\r\n                falls below this threshold, the heart is beating too slowly.\r\n          <li>The tachycardia threshold: if the ZCCs in an interval equlas or\r\n                exceeds this threshold, the heart is beating too quickly.\r\n        </ul>\r\n        The simulated heart file contains a sequence of electical signals that\r\n           the ICD should process.\r\n    <li>Display on the console the information extracted from the configuration\r\n          file;

then it should\r\n            read and display the second <b>10</b> signals (numbered\r\n            <b>11</b> through <b>20</b>) and then display <b>Make Decision</b>\r\n            again, etc.\r\n        Test it using <b>simple-config.txt</b> and <b>simple-heart.txt</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <li>Enhance the program so that it computes and displays the ZCC after it\r\n          reads each value from the heart data file.\r\n        This change will require two variables: one storing the value of the\r\n          <i>previous</i> signal and one storing the value of the\r\n          <i>current</i> signal; the <i>current</i> value becomes the\r\n          <i>previous</i> one at the end of each loop iteration.\r\n        Initially (before the loop even starts), set the <i>previous</i> value\r\n          to <b>0</b>.\r\n        Each iteration of the loop reads a new value for <i>current</i> from\r\n           the heart input file. \r\n        <p>\r\n        Also change the <b>Make Decision</b> message to display the current\r\n          ZCC (whose value it will actually use to check for bradycardia or\r\n          tachycardia).\r\n        Important: after each decision is made, the ICD should reset the ZCC\r\n          to <b>0</b>, as it begins  computing the ZCC for the next interval\r\n          of signals.\r\n        <p>\r\n        Test it using <b>simple-config.txt</b> and <b>simple-heart.txt</b>\r\n          and compare the results to the table of values above.\r\n        When you have verified that the right ZCC values appear in these\r\n          messages, remove (or comment out) the code that displays each signal,\r\n          and the ZCC for each new signal read.\r\n        <p>\r\n    <li>Enhance the program to display <b>Bradycardia Detected</b> if the ZCC\r\n          equals or falls below the threshold read from the configuration\r\n          file, and display <b>Tachycardia Detected</b> if the ZCC equals or\r\n          exceeds the threshold read from the configuration file.\r\n  </ol>\r\n  Test the final program using <b>regular-config.txt</b> and each of the\r\n     <b>regular-</b> input files.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Extra Credit -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ExtraCredit\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Extra Credit</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  The dice war problem has 1 point of extra credit.\r\n  To earn it, at the bottom of the main comment in the <b>DiceWar</b> class,\r\n    include a section labelled <b>Extra Credit</b>.\r\n  In this section, estimate the average number of dice rolls for a game\r\n    where each player starts out with 1,000,000 chips.\r\n  Explain the details of how you arrived at your estimate.\r\n  <p>\r\n  <b>Do not discuss your estimate with anyone but the student you are pairing\r\n    with.</b>\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
