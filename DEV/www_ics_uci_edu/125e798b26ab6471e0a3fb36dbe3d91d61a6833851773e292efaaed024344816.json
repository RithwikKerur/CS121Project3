They're not required as part of this homework, but it would be a good idea if you were able to do these problems. (Some of the code hasn't been translated into Python, but for this purpose it should be easy enough to follow.) <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i42/w12.fxrqans.html\">Answers</a> are also available, but actually try to do the problems before looking.</P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><b><strong>(c)</strong></b>  Beyond that, spend your time working\n  on the lab assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Written by David G.
