During this time, you have priority \r\n\t\t\tover other students in the lab. Note, however, you only have priority over \r\n\t\t\tother students if you are working on class work (i.e. not playing games). Our \r\n\t\t\tTA will be available in the lab during these times to answer questions. This is \r\n\t\t\tan ideal opportunity to get some help with your lab homework in front of a \r\n\t\t\tcomputer.\r\n\t\t</P>\r\n\t\t<P>There are several department labs which you can use for working on your lab \r\n\t\t\tassignments.

However, it is critical that when you write up your homework \r\n\t\t\tor sit at the computer to write your programs that you do so without \r\n\t\t\tassistance. This is the only way to ensure that it is your own work. Group \r\n\t\t\twork, sharing code, or copying the homework assignments, is a <EM>violation of the \r\n\t\t\t\thonesty policy</EM> of the School of Information and Computer Science and \r\n\t\t\tUC Irvine.&nbsp; You are expected to be familiar with these policies. They can \r\n\t\t\tbe found at <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/policies.html\">\r\n\t\t\t\thttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/policies.html</A>.\r\n\t\t</P>\r\n\t\t<P>Any violation of these policies result in a letter describing the incident which \r\n\t\t\tis placed in your file on campus. Since abiding by the the honesty policies is \r\n\t\t\tan academic requirement of this course, failure to do so will typically result \r\n\t\t\tin an F in the course. Very severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result \r\n\t\t\tin suspension or expulsion from the university (and this is the case in all \r\n\t\t\tother classes you take at UCI).</P>\r\n\t</BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
