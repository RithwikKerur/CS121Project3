Unlike other algorithms for this \nproblem, it does not solve the replacement path problem repeatedly. Instead, \nwe exploit the notion of sidetracks of a shortest path trees. Sidetracks were \nfirst used by Eppstein to solve a similar problem where the output paths are \nnot required to be simple.\n<p></p>\n\nOur algorithm maintains the worst case running time of state-of-the-art \nalgorithms for this problem. In practice, the sidetrack-based approach is \nhighly competitive on all graph classes that we used in computational studies \ncompared to other approaches, and faster by up to two orders of magnitude on \nsome of the classes.\n</p><p>\nJoint work with Petra Mutzel\n</p>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
