However, I think they may be too difficult\nfor this purpose. So, while they may be useful as practice\nquestions, please do not assume that future exam questions will be\nequally difficult. \n\n<p>(a) Describe an efficient data structure for the following\nproblem: you are given as input a set S of n points in the x-y\nplane, and must handle queries that specify query values a and b\nand return any point (x,y) in S with y &lt;= ax+b, if such a point\nexists. What is the space usage, preprocessing time, and query time\nof your data structure?</p>\n\n<p>(b) Suppose that there exists a data structure D for problem (a)\nthat solves the problem in space R(n), preprocessing time P(n), and\nquery time Q(n). Now we must solve a slightly more difficult\nproblem: for each query, we must find the point with the smallest x\ncoordinate among all points (x,y) in S with y &lt;= ax+b. Describe\nhow to use data structure D as part of a layered data structure\nthat solves this harder problem. Analyze the space usage,\npreprocessing time, and query time of your overall data structure\nin terms of P, Q, R, and n.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
