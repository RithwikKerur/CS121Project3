Also assume a range on the total weight of S.\nIn what region might we find the centroid of S? \nThe answer turns out to be a convex polytope,\nthe projection of a drum-shaped section of a (d+1)-dimensional\n<I>zonotope</I>.  The example below provides a lower bound of\nOmega(n<sup>d</sup>) on the complexities of these <I>centroid polytopes</I>.\n\n<P><CENTER><IMG src=\"ukraine_3_12_0^13.gif\" WIDTH=317 HEIGHT=366></CENTER>\n<P>\n\nZonotopes are defined using the <I>Minkowski sum</I> of sets A and B in\na d-dimensional vector space, which is the set {p + q | p in A and q in\nB}.  A zonotope is a special kind of convex polytope formed by taking\nthe Minkowski sum of a collection of line segments.  Familiar examples\nof zonotopes include the cube (generated by three unit length segments\nat right angles to each other) the rhombic dodecahedron (generated by\nfour segments), and the truncated octahedron (generated by six\nsegments parallel to the edges of the octahedron).\nPaul Heckbert has constructed a more complicated\n<A HREF=\"http://almond.srv.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/ph/www/circ30.zono.gif\">\nzonohedron generated by 30 vectors in a circle</A>.\nThe figure above is similar to Heckbert's, but is\ngenerated by two sets of line segments,\nwith the endpoints of the two sets forming two different circles.\nThe segments on the larger circle determine the overall shape of the zonotope,\nwhile the segments on the smaller circle lead to the existence\nof the belt of narrow faces near the equator of the zonotope.\nIf one cuts this zonotope by a plane, one gets a polygonal slice\nwith Omega(n<sup>2</sup>) sides.\n<P>\n\nEdelsbrunner [Algorithms in Combinatorial Geometry, Springer, 1987] writes \n``it is very instructive to visualize the inductive construction\nof a zonotope''.\nTo add the <I>i</I>th segment z(<I>i</I>) to the Minkowski sum,\nwe sweep the current zonotope parallel\nto z(<I>i</I>) and then take the swept volume as the new zonotope.\nIf we assume that the <I>i</I>th segment runs ``north-south\",\nthis step enlarges the current zonotope\nby stretching its ``equator'',\na belt of faces of dimensions up to d-2,\ninto a ``zone'' of faces of dimensions up to d-1. \nFaces of zonotopes are themselves lower-dimensional zonotopes. \n<P>\n\nThere is a nice connection between d-dimensional zonotopes and\n(d-1)-dimensional arrangements.  We consider the space of unit normal\nvectors of hyperplanes tangent to the zonotope.  The d-dimensional unit\nvectors form a sphere, equivalent to oriented projective (d-1)-space.\nAny given unit vector is normal to a unique hyperplane that touches the\nzonotope at some kind of face.  One can swing a hyperplanes while\nkeeping it tangent to a k-dimensional face, passing through a collection\nof angles with dimension (d-1-k); these angles form a cell in this\nprojective space and the faces of the zonotope thus correspond to a dual\ncell decomposition of space.  If there were only a single vector, this\ndecomposition would be given by a single hyperplane (partitioning the\ntangents into those that touch the origin, those that touch the endpoint\nof the vector, and those parallel to the vector that touch both points).\nBut the decomposition corresponding to a Minkowski sum is formed by\noverlaying the decompositions corresponding to the two summands, so the\ncell decomposition of the tangent space to a zonotope is exactly a\nhyperplane arrangement.  In particular, a zone of faces parallel to a\ngiven vector corresponds exactly to a hyperplane.\n<P>\nBecause of this correspondence, one can construct zonotopes\nin time O(n<sup>d-1</sup>).
