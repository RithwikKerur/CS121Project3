With the anticipated growth in this application area, more and more stress is being placed on the underlying transport system to provide the kind of quality of experience (QoE) that these applications and their users expect. The quality of an end user&#8217;s experience is the true litmus test of a proper online game deployment.

The patent, on which Prof. Franz is the first named inventor and which is assigned to the Regents of the University of California, protects the idea of using program diversity in conjunction with parallel programming to protect a computer against malicious hacker attacks.\n</p>\n<p>\nLike many major inventions, the idea is quite simple at the core: instead of generating a single binary from a source program, a special compiler generates several slightly different program versions that implement the program's functionality in subtly different ways. These different versions are then executed in lockstep on a multicore processor.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe key idea is to generate the versions in such a way that all \"in specification\" behavior is identical across the versions, but \"out of specification\" behavior differs significantly. As a result, the versions will execute in lockstep as long as the program is behaving\nas designed, but will typically diverge as soon as an attacker exploits a programming bug, causing \"out of specification\" behavior. This can be detected almost in real time.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn addition to this U.S. Patent, Prof. Franz won over $900,000 in additional funding for his work on software diversity in the past month. First, he won an additional year of funding from DARPA for his project \"Defending Mobile Apps Through Automated Software Diversity.\" The existing project, on which Dr. Franz is the sole PI, has been extended through February 2015 along with an additional award of $467,442, bringing the total to $1,847,602. Second, he received a\nfurther award of $456,809 from the Navy on a subcontract from Johns Hopkins University for his project \"Meta-Circular Software Diversity for Intrusion Tolerant Clouds.\"\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n\n<hr/>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p><b><a name=\"summer_2012_newman_awarded_300k_from_nsf\"></a>Newman awarded $300K from NSF </b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: David Newman \" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/newman.jpg\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><b> David <br/> Newman </b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\nAssociate Research Scientist <strong>David Newman</strong> has been awarded a $600,000 grant by the National Science Foundation, with funds split equally with co-Investigator Meg Blume-Kohout, an Economist at University of New Mexico.\n</p>\n<p>\nNewman and Blume-Kohout's interdisciplinary research will combine machine learning and econometrics to create models that assess effectiveness and efficiency of biomedical funding, focusing on the National Institutes of Health.\n</p>\n<p>\n\"In this current age of scarcity, two things are required: fiscal restraint, and an accurate assessment of research effectiveness and efficiency\" says Newman. \"Matching publications and grant funding levels by machine learned topics will allow us to evaluate the contribution of publicly-funded research to the body of published research.

To get a sense of how visionary the work was, consider that this paper was published in June 2002 (and thus accepted in Jan 2002), even a couple of months before Amazon EC2 and S3 services were launched (of course, Amazon RDS and SQL Azure came much later). The core of the paper focuses on the challenges of how to leverage cloud services while keeping some of the information (at the discretion of the enterprise/user) hidden from the service provider. Beyond the specific algorithmic details, the key contribution is the framework: (i) introduction of a mapping function, and (ii) query splitting logic to ensure how the work can be distributed across cloud and client when some information is encrypted. Is this framework used by enterprises today? As best as we can tell, the answer is perhaps no. But, is the framework interesting and has real possibilities of adoption and further impact and more follow-on by research community? Absolutely. In summary, this paper is one of the early papers to foresee the world of Database as Service (before any one of us were working on that problem). The specific technical focus was dealt with reasonable depth. The impact of the technical focus has not yet been seen by the industry but this paper has the possibility of inspiring much more follow-on work/thinking (beyond 140+ citations it already has in ACM DL). </i>\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p><b><a name=\"spring_2012_game_showcase\"></a>UCI team earns prize for best educational game at intercollegiate showcase</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"Q-Bitz robot\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/noteworthy/qbitz-robot.jpg\" style=\"height: 90px;\"/>\n</div>\n<p>\nThe top two finishers in the latest \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/spotlight/spotlight_gamejam_winter_2012.php\">Game Jam</a>\n&#8220;build a video game in a week&#8221; Tournament at UCI were recognized at the first-ever IEEE GameSig \n<a href=\"http://www.gamesig.org/showcase\">Intercollegiate Computer Game Showcase</a>, \nheld April 28 at Chapman University. \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1dcVfGVs5A\">Q-Bitz</a> \nwon the MIND Research Institute Prize for Best Educational Game, while \n<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFRZYMhFP1Q\">Massteroid</a> \nreceived honorable mention.

One thread is inspired by a movement in medicine called Clinical Translational Science in which funding is given to researchers to translate basic research into guidelines, treatments, and regimens that clinicians can use. A second thread arose in reflecting about our own recent work in which we translated a theory about what makes for good distance collaboration into an online assessment tool and administered it to hundreds of people involved in remote collaboration. Upon completion of the assessment, each participant immediately gets a personalized report on the strengths of their collaboration, the challenges, and what to do about it. We get the data, and they get the help. These two threads point to making a difference, having broader impact. In this talk I will review some ways we can have an impact, both directly to people, through design practice (our clinicians), and via a myriad of other tools while doing good research. I encourage us all to spend more energy on having more direct effects on the world in which we live. </i>\n</p>\n<p>\nA video of her lecture and other background materials are available through the <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2145204.2145208\">ACM Digital Library</a>.\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<p><b>WINTER 2012</b></p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p><b><a name=\"winter_2012_nardi_serves_as_icic_2012_program_co-chair\"></a>Nardi serves as ICIC 2012 program co-chair</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Bonnie Nardi\" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/nardi.jpg\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><b>Bonnie<br/>Nardi</b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\nInformatics professor <strong>Bonnie Nardi</strong> is the program co-chair for the 4<sup>th</sup> ACM International Conference on Intercultural Collaboration (<a href=\"http://langrid.nict.go.jp/icic2012/\">ICIC 2012</a>), which takes place March 21-23 in Bangalore, India.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe main theme of this year&#8217;s conference is intercultural collaboration, from both technical and socio-cultural perspectives.

Running software on virtual machines rather than directly on hardware creates cross-platform portability and provides some insulation against malicious or faulty programs.&#8221; </p>\n<p>\nFranz&#8217;s research project aims to simplify the development of virtual machines and improve their architecture, especially when used on mobile devices. The project has garnered additional support from Samsung, which awarded a supplemental $350,000 to Franz this spring.</p>\n<p>\nFranz continues: &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make sense to have three separate VMs (JavaScript, Flash and Dalvik) on a cell phone, where space is at a premium, when these VMs are actually quite similar to each other under the hood and have lots of overlapping functionality.&#8221; Franz&#8217;s research aims to create a modular VM that can support multiple languages while using only a fraction of the space. Rather than compete for processor resources and memory, the modules of the VM supporting the various languages would collaborate with each other.</p>\n<p>\nFranz leads the Secure Systems and Languages Laboratory at UC Irvine, one of the top research teams on dynamic compilation, virtual machines and language-based computer security. In collaboration with the Mozilla foundation, he transitioned the JavaScript compilation technology invented in his lab into the Firefox browser, where it is used every day by hundreds of millions of people.\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<p><b><a name=\"fall_2011_baldi_tsudik_present_at_css_chicago\"></a>Baldi, Tsudik and team present at CSS 2011 <br/></b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Pierre Baldi \" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/pfbaldi.jpg\"/>\n<p><b>Pierre <br/> Baldi</b></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Gene Tsudik \" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/gts.jpg\"/>\n<p><b>Gene <br/> Tsudik</b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\nA paper on efficient handling of fully-sequenced human genomes &#8212; co-authored by computer science professors\n<strong>Pierre Baldi</strong> and <strong>Gene Tsudik</strong>, recent alumnus <strong>Emiliano De Cristofaro</strong> (Ph.D. &#8217;11), postdoctoral researcher <strong>Paolo Gasti</strong>, and Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics researcher <strong>Roberta Baronio</strong> &#8212; will be presented at the 18th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Chicago.

In a recent \n<a href=\"http://www.iarpa.gov/Media/28_iarpa_fuse_research.pdf\">news release</a>, \nIARPA announced that the Foresight and Understanding from Scientific Exposition (FUSE) Program seeks to produce a new capability to accelerate the process of identifying and prioritizing emerging technologies across the globe. Smyth and co-investigator Newman will develop algorithms that can detect statistically significant changes in language usage and citation patterns to measure how scientific disciplines are evolving over time. FUSE will be carried out in collaboration with researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois. \n</p>\n<p>\nBoth projects will build on research by Smyth, Newman, Steyvers and their students, who for the past few years have been developing statistical models and algorithms for automatically extracting information from text.
