(big Omega), and &Theta; (big Theta)\r\n      notation, and demonstrate the ability to use these notations to analyze\r\n      implementations of template classes (both analytically and\r\n      empirically), and understand the usefulness and limits of these\r\n      notations.\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Understand C++ and general programming ideas that aid in 1-2:\r\n    abstract classes, virtual functions, inheritance, recursion, hashing,\r\n    caching, the decorator pattern, etc. \r\n</ol>\r\nWe will spend the first few weeks of the quarter exploring the properties of\r\n  template classes: using them to write programs, studying simple array\r\n  implementations,  and eventually implementing some using linked lists.\r\nAfterward we will learn about more advanced data structures and how to use them\r\n  to implement the more complicated data types efficiently.\r\n<p>\r\nThis course emphasizes Object Oriented Programming (OOP).\r\nThe foundational unit of OOP is the <i>class</i>: a syntactic structure that\r\n  describes and encapsulates both the behavior (methods implemented by control\r\n  structures) and state (fields implementing data structures) of objects.\r\nClasses provide an excellent motivation and context for exploring most\r\n  interesting aspects of programming.\r\nWe can view software as a collection of interacting objects (which are\r\n   constructed from classes; often with many objects constructed from\r\n   the same class).\r\nIn C++, classes defintions are split into <b>.hpp</b> and <b>.cpp</b> files;\r\nbut templated classes (the ones we will mostly use/write) have just <b>.hpp</b>\r\n  files, which are split into declaration and definition parts.\r\n<p>\r\nThe main programming methodology that we will learn and employ is TDD\r\n   (test-driven development).\r\nWe will use Drivers and <b>GoogleTest</b> to test our code; with\r\n  <b>GoogleTest</b> unit tests, we can automatically test code (and retest it\r\n  when we make changes, until it is passes all the tests: meaning it may be\r\n  correct or the tests might be insufficient to expose errors).\r\n<p>\r\nProgramming style is a particularly important topic: to understand\r\n  programming, we really need to develop appropriate aesthetics that allow\r\n  us to separate \"elegant\" programs from \"hacks\".\r\nAs in any writing activity, we must also learn to be self-critical of our own\r\n  creations, so that we can continually improve them; this skill is difficult\r\n  to acquire, and its importance extends well beyond the domain of\r\n  programming.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, to become an expert in any discipline, we must master its\r\n   terminology.\r\nFluency with technical terms allows us to communicate -and even to think-\r\n   more accurately and concisely.\r\nTherefore, the materials in this course will define, illustrate, and\r\n   repeatedly use many important technical terms concerning programming.\r\nTake the time required to master them. An old Chinese proverb says,\r\n     \"The first step towards wisdom is calling things by their right names.\" \r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Textbook -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Textbook\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Textbook<br>(recommended)</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThe primary materials for this course will come from lectures and from my\r\n  notes on the lectures.\r\nI encourage students to use Google to help you learn and understand any\r\n  C++ features that you need to learn.\r\n<p>\r\nI will assume that you have a book equivalent to the text for ICS-45C,\r\n  which covers the fundamentals of C++ (and quite a few advanced topics as\r\n  well).\r\n<p>\r\n  <o>\r\n  <li><b>Savitch</b>,\r\n      <i>Absolute C++ (5th Edition)</i>,\r\n      Pearson\r\n       (about $130: new at Amazon/used at the Anthill).\r\n  </ol>\r\n<p>\r\nHere are two good data structures books in C++. \r\n<p>\r\n  <o>\r\n  <li><b>Goodrich and Tamassia</b>,\r\n      <i>Data Structures & Algorithms in C++, Second Edition (2011)</i>,\r\n      Wiley,\r\n       (about $105: new at Amazon).\r\n  <p>\r\n  <li><b>Weiss</b>,\r\n      <i>Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++, Fourth Edition (2013)</i>,\r\n      Prentice Hall\r\n       (about $120: new at Amazon).\r\n  </ol>\r\n<p>\r\nSee <a href=\"http://www.directtextbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  DirectTextbook</a>, which crawls the web for cheaper prices.\r\nDon't forget to account for shipping costs and delivery time.\r\nAmazon often list used copies of both books cheaper.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Computing Platforms and Programming Environments -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ComputingPlatform\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Computing Platforms and Programming Environments</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThe standard computing platforms for this course are\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Intel-based PCs running the Windows Operating System (OS).\r\n    <li>Macintosh PCs running the Mac OS operating system\r\n    <li>Either PC running Linux.\r\n  </ul>\r\n<p>\r\nProgramming courses at most schools are moving towards a model in which most\r\n  students use their own computers (or those of their roommates or friends) to\r\n  complete their programming assignments.\r\nAll the software used in ICS-46 is available, for free, on the web.\r\nWe are assuming that students have already installed a web browser, and have a\r\n  high-speed connection to the World-Wide Web: e.g., via the campus network,\r\n  or by cable, or a DSL line, or just WiFi.\r\n  <p>\r\nThe programming environment that we will use is CLion: it is an Integrated\r\n  Development Environment (IDE), including a project manager, editor, compiler,\r\n  debugger, class browser, help facility, etc.\r\nWe will also use the Clang C++ compiler and runtime system with this IDE.\r\nThis software, and others useful for the course, are available through the\r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/online46.html\">Course Software</a>\r\n  link (see <b>Main Software</b> under the ICS-46 heading).\r\n  <p>\r\nTalk to your instructor or TA immediately if you are experiencing any problems\r\n  with your computing platform.\r\nTypically it takes only a few days before everyone has correctly downloaded and\r\n  installed the necessary software, and learned how to use it properly.\r\nUsing this software is integral to every programming assignment during the\r\n  quarter, so it is best to be aggressive and master this software quickly.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Computers -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Computers\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Computers:<br>ICS Labs</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nIn addition to using their own machines, students can do their coursework on\r\n  the machines in the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab\">ICS Labs</a>,\r\n  which are described on this link and in more detail below.\r\nThe main upside of using the ICS labs is that it will be easy to get ICS-46\r\n  staff to help you there; the main downside is that you will not be using\r\n  your own computer -unless you have a portable and bring it to the labs to\r\n  get the best of both worlds.\r\nRead the following to learn about \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/students/acct_activate.php\">\r\n ICS Lab Account Activation</a>.\r\n<p>\r\nICS courses often schedule lab hours (to complement lecture hours), during\r\n  which students can learn how to use software tools and work on their\r\n  programming assignments, all under the supervision of ICS-46 staff members.\r\nThis quarter, all Labs meet in rooms <b>ICS 189</b> and <b>ICS 183</b>.\r\nEach of these rooms contains about 45 Dell Optiplex computers running Windows\r\n  7 and all the necessary course software.\r\nThese labs are <b>typically</b> open for class use on weekdays, during \"normal\"\r\n  hours: 8:00am to 8:00pm; and, they are closed on weekends.\r\n<p>\r\nThe lab in <b>ICS 364</b> is a general purpose lab in which no courses are\r\n  scheduled.\r\nIt is typically open to students on weekdays and weekends during \"extended\"\r\n   hours:\r\n   MTuWThT 8:00am - 10:pm,\r\n   F 8:00am - 8:00pm,\r\n   and SaSu 12:00pm (noon) - 6:00pm.\r\nYou can examine the\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/lab_schedule/index.php\">\r\n  Lab Schedules</a> for all these labs.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIf you find it inconvenient to use these labs, and would rather work from\r\n  your dorm room or off campus, ICS-46 staff will also provide more limited\r\n  online help through Instant Messaging.\r\nThe Piazza Message Folders are also an excellent way to get help.\r\n<!---\r\nIf you have installed realVNC on your computer, we will be able to monitor and\r\n  manipulate your computer directly from ours.\r\nWe will discuss the details of this system for help, and how to use it, early\r\n  in the quarter.\r\n-->\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, although the machines in the ICS labs also provide some external\r\n  storage space (on a Unix system), it is an excellent idea to obtain a USB\r\n  memory stick to backup all the work you do, both on your own computer and\r\n  in our labs.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Office Hours -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"OfficeHours\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Instructor<br>Office Hours</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI welcome students (individually, programming partners, or small groups), to\r\n  come by and talk with me during my Office Hours.\r\nIf we need to talk, but you cannot come during my office hours, please email\r\n  me so that we can arrange an alternative time to meet; or better yet, maybe\r\n  we even can resolve the entire issue over email (or using the Piazza Message\r\n  Folders, discussed below, where other students can benefit from questions and\r\n  answers).\r\n<p>\r\nI will be glad to talk with you about any of the ICS-31/-32/-33/-45C/-46\r\n   courses,  Computer Science, UCI, or whatever else you want to discuss.\r\nAlthough UCI is a large school, ICS is a smaller school within it, and ICS\r\n  promotes opportunities for close faculty-student interaction, especially\r\n  with instructors who are lecturers.\r\nUnfortunately, in my opinion, not enough students take advantage of this\r\n  opportunity at UCI.\r\n<p>\r\nI especially encourage students who are having problems in the course to visit\r\n  me immediately; I know that this is asking a lot, but the payoff for\r\n  recognizing the situation and acting on it immediately is tremendous.\r\nThe primary reason that students fail to thrive in programming courses is that\r\n  they fall behind in their work -often because of what is initially a small\r\n  misunderstanding; but, because of the cumulative nature of this course,\r\n  even a small misunderstanding can quickly grow into a big one.\r\nOften, I can quickly diagnose and rectify such a problem one-on-one.\r\nGetting help fast can critically affect your overall performance in\r\n  this course: many times I've seen students start performing one grade\r\n  level higher after coming in to get help during my office hours.\r\n<p>\r\nUnfortunately, I teach hundreds of students during a typical quarter, so my\r\n  time is a bit limited.\r\nBut, generally I have time during office hours to talk with all the students\r\n  who visit.\r\nSo, please come if you need help so we can try to work out your issues/problems.\r\nOf course, you can also talk to your TA and Lab Tutors during your labs, where\r\n  resources and time are not so tight.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Online Hours -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"OnlineHours\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Instructor<br>Online Hours</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI hold online hours every day before class/lab meets: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,\r\n  Wednesday and Thursday  evenings (most programming assignments are due on\r\n  Tuesday evening) from 9:00pm-10:00pm.\r\nI will be logged  onto AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) as <b>richardepattis</b>\r\n  during these times.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you are not already a member of AIM (or a similar service that can message\r\n  AIM users)  <a href=\"http://www.aim.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign Up</a> for\r\n  this service (it is free).\r\nUsing this system, you will be able to Instant Message me.\r\n<!---, as well as use\r\n   an audio (voice) connection if you have a headset with a microphone.\r\n-->\r\nYou can IM me with questions;

Sorry to bother you.\"\r\nThis works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners.\r\nOne university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.\r\nStudents with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before\r\n  they could speak to a human counselor. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>- B. Kernighan & D. Pike\r\n  (in \"The Practice of Programming\" pp. 123)</i></p></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\nTalking about programming is important.\r\nOne of the reasons that we program in pairs is to always have someone who you\r\n  can to talk to about your code; unlike the teddy bear, someone who has an\r\n  interest in getting your code to work, and who might supply relevant feedback.\r\n<p>\r\nI try to answer email every few hours during the day.\r\nI normally will not answer email sent after about 10:00pm until early the next\r\n  morning (but I'll typically answer it by the next morning).\r\nIf you have problems late at night that you cannot resolve, please send me\r\n  email (or post on the relevant Piazza Folder) summarizing your problems,\r\n  and then go to work on something else (or if it is really late, go to sleep).\r\nBy planning to finish assignments early, you can protect yourself against a big\r\n  problem that arises at night and cannot be fixed until the next day: you\r\n  really don't want to have to fix such a problem the night that an assignment\r\n  is due.\r\n<p>\r\nFor most problems -ones that are of general interest to the class- I would\r\n  prefer that you ask the question using a Piazza Folder (see below).\r\nIn this way, everyone in the class can see the question and its answer\r\n  (which I might provide, or a a TA/Lab Tutor, or another student).\r\nOne of the few advantages of a big class is having lots of student activity in\r\n  Piazza Folder, leading to peer-instruction.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, the Electronic Educational Environment (EEE) at UCI creates and\r\n  maintains course-wide mailing lists.\r\nI have created a \"merged\" mailing list for all my ICS-46 students (which also\r\n  includes those students signed up for CSE 46, both in the Sammueli School of\r\n  Engineering and the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science).\r\nAll members of our course (staff and students) can use this mailing list, whose\r\n  email address is <b>ics46a-F19@classes.uci.edu</b>\r\nAll messages sent via this discussion list are archived: click\r\n    <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/f19/35540/\" target=\"main\">\r\n    here</a> or see the <b>Email Archive</b> link on the course website.\r\nMostly student-initiated questions/discussions should use the Piazza Folders\r\n  mentioned below, but sometimes students can use this email list to inform the\r\n  instructor, staff, and other students about some timely issue: e.g., the\r\n  Checkmate Homework Dropoff system not responding to program submissions.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Bboard -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Bboard\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\"

(of interest to many students in the\r\n  course, not just you), then you should post the question in one of the\r\n  <a href=\"https://piazza.com/class/jxhv9idtxkd6at\" target=\"main\">\r\n Message Folders</a> on Piazza.\r\nThese Folders allow students to ask questions (or start discussions) easily, as\r\n  well as supply answers (or participate in the discsussion further).\r\nFor example, if a lecture note, programming assignment, etc. contains unclear\r\n  (or even contradictory) information, post a note about it to the appropriate\r\n  Folder, asking for a clarification.\r\nI, or someone from my staff will read and reply to whatever questions are\r\n  asked.\r\nIn fact, if you read a question in a Folder, and know the answer -or generally\r\n  have something to contribute to the topic- I encourage you to to post a reply\r\n  to help resolve the problem even sooner.\r\nThus, you can use the Folders to discuss any course materials out-of-class.\r\n<p>\r\nAgain, Folders are appropriate for questions relevant to most students in the\r\n  course; directly email me (see above) for questions of a more\r\n  individualistic nature.\r\nObviously students should not use these Folders to solicit nor post answers to\r\n  take-home quizzes, programming assignments, or anything else that would be\r\n  interpreted as academic misconduct (which is discussed in greater detail\r\n  below).\r\nBut general informational questions and answers are fine.\r\nI often find that students send me individual email when they should be\r\n  posting in a Folder; think before you decide which to do.\r\n<p>\r\nIt is an excellent idea to check these Folders frequently, to keep up to date\r\n  on any coursewide discussions.\r\nYou can configure the Folders to send you an email digest daily, which contains\r\n  links to new/updated postings.\r\nI received such a digest, and typically review and answer all outstanding\r\n  questions early each

class daily.\r\nDuring the 35+ years that I have been teaching, I have observed a strong\r\n  correlation between attending class and understanding the material (which \r\n  ultimately improves student grades).\r\nHaving all the course materials online is a great resource, but just as\r\n  important is coming to class -and paying attention, once you are there-\r\n  and participating by volunteering information when you know it and asking\r\n  questions when you are confused.\r\n<p>\r\nI will lecture during class, but I prefer discussing the material and answering\r\n  questions; asking you questions about the material, and amplifying on those\r\n  topics that need further discussion.\r\nI expect most \"lectures\" to be interactive, with students participating.\r\n<p>\r\nI encourage you to participate by raising your hand; sometimes I may finish\r\n  the point I'm making before calling on you, but please keep your hand up if\r\n  you want to speak.\r\nIf you have a question about the material, it typically means that I have\r\n  explained something incorrectly, poorly, or incompletely, and that other\r\n  students have (or will soon have, maybe right after they leave the classroom)\r\n  the same question.\r\nSo, it would be best for all of us to correct the problem immediately in class\r\n  by someone bringing it to my attention.\r\nIf you cannot ask in class, post a question later on a Piazza Message Folder.\r\nIn summary, this class runs on the Dershowitz principle:\r\n  \"Question authority; but raise your hand

five programming assignments to ensure that everyone is\r\n  getting the necessary hands-on programming experience.\r\nWhile working on these programs, you will acquire a solid and fine-tuned\r\n  understanding of the course material as well as gain important\r\n  <i>process of programming</i> skills.\r\nPrograms will typically be discussed and started in some Lab, and then be\r\n  due (submitted electronically) about two weeks later, at 11:30pm.\r\nFor a typical programming assignment, you will have 3 lab meetings and 2\r\n  weekends to work on it: expect to spend time out of class finishing these\r\n  assignments.\r\n<p>\r\nI encourage students to work in groups of two on programming assignments.\r\nSuch an approach is called\r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html\" tarket =\"_top\">\r\n  Pair Programming</a>.\r\n<b>One student</b> from each pair will submit all parts of the program, with\r\n  both their names and your lab numbers on it (in the code/files).\r\nApart from your pair, you can get <b>general</b> help from anyone (Instructor,\r\n  TA, Lab Tutors, friends, etc.) on programs.\r\nThe best kind of help to get is oral: where you describe the problem, possibly\r\n  showing your code, and then get an oral answer that you understand and can\r\n  translate into code.\r\nIn such instances, you are learning. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>You may neither copy nor transcribe (written or orally) any parts of another\r\n    student's program.</b> \r\n<p>\r\nWhen you submit your programs for grading, you are expected to understand all\r\n  parts of them and have improved your <i>process of programming</i> skills\r\n  while writing and debugging them.\r\n<p>\r\nYou will submit your solutions to programming assignments through a special\r\n  web page that records the time they are submitted.\r\nTo promote good time management skills, if you submit a program at least 24\r\n  hours  before it is due, you will receive 1 point of extra credit.\r\nIf you submit a program 48 hours early, you will receive 2 points.\r\nYou can gain no more than 2 points of extra credit by early submission.\r\nFor an 60 point assignment, this extra credit is equivalent to one third a\r\n  letter grade improvement.\r\n<p>\r\nTwo weeks is sufficient time to complete these programming assignments.\r\nI know from long teaching experience that students who work ahead of the\r\n  deadlines learn more, in a less stressed envrionment; students working right\r\n  up to a deadline are more concerned with getting the right answer and less\r\n  concerned with learning anything.\r\nSo, on the other side of this coin, I will not accept any late programs without\r\n  some kind of prior request (and prior typically doesn't mean the night\r\n  before).\r\nSo, you must turn in your work on time: if you turn in a partially working\r\n  program on time, it will receive partial credit; if you do not turn in\r\n  anything on time, then I must assume you did no work on the program, and you\r\n  will receive no credit.\r\nTherefore, always turn in whatever work you have finished by the official due\r\n  time.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width

whether a student has cheated depends on the intent of an\r\n  assignment, the ground rules specified by the instructor, and the behavior of\r\n  the student. \r\nThe following two guidelines help an instructor decide whether plagiarism has\r\n   occurred in programming assignment, which is the fuzziest area:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if an assignment that calls for independent\r\n         development and implementation of a program results in two or more \r\n         solutions so similar that one solution can be converted to the\r\n         other(s) by a series of simple transformations.\r\n  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if a student who completed an assignment \r\n         cannot explain both the intricacies of the solution and \r\n         the techniques used to generate that solution.\r\n</ul>\r\nIt is unreasonable to expect a complete definition of cheating that would cover\r\n  all cases, because each situation is important enough to merit careful,\r\n  individual scrutiny; however, it is helpful to have guidelines and\r\n   precedents.\r\n<p>\r\nHere are some examples that are clearly cheating and clearly not cheating.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Examples of CHEATING</b>:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Turning in someone else's work, in whole or in part, as your own (with or\r\n        without his/her knowledge), without it including a statement of\r\n        collaboration in the solution.\r\n  <li>Allowing another student to turn in your work, in whole or in part, as\r\n        his/her own, without it including a statement of collaboration in the\r\n        solution.\r\n  <li>Turning in duplicate solution.\r\n      Even if all the comments are changed, all the variables names are\r\n        changed, all the whitespace is changed, and the code appears in a\r\n        different order: it is still the same program.\r\n  <li>Several students/pairs writing one assignment and turning in multiple\r\n        copies, all represented (implicitly or explicitly) as an individual\r\n        student's/pair's work, without it including a statement of\r\n        collaboration in the solution.\r\n  <li>After receiving graded written work, returning written work, for\r\n        regrading, which has been altered.\r\n  <li>Finding a solution to the same problem on the web and submitting it\r\n        without explicit attribution in the solution; note that you may\r\n        not post problems on the web, seeking a solution.\r\n  <li>Stealing an examination or solution from the instructor.\r\n</ul>\r\nGenerally, you should NOT EXAMINE, by reading hardcopy or by copying a file,\r\n  the program of any other student (nor should you let anyone examine or make\r\n  a copy of your files).\r\nDoing so can easily lead to an intended or unintended academic violation.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you ever feel that after talking to someone about a program, which is legal,\r\n  your solution will be very similar to theirs, cite the consultation in the\r\n  header comment in your program.\r\nDoing so protects you from University disciplinary action (although the\r\n  instructor is free to grade the material as he/she sees fit).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Examples of NOT CHEATING</b>:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Turning in work done alone or with the help of the course's staff.\r\n  <li>Submitting one assignment for a group of students if group work is \r\n        explicitly permitted (or required, as in pair-programming).\r\n  <li>Getting or giving help about using the computers.\r\n  <li>Discussing assignments to better understand them.\r\n  <li>High level discussions of course material to better understand them.\r\n  <li>Getting or giving help about correcting simple programming errors.\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain, the key here is not studying, verbatim, someone else's code, and then\r\n  reproducing it as your own work.\r\nIt is too easy to copy such code without really understanding it.\r\nTechnically, for programming assignments, even understanding the resulting code\r\n  is not enough (if someone else wrote it): you should also play an active role\r\n  in synthesizing and debugging it.\r\nThe course is as much about skills as about knowledge.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td

available.\r\nSome use search engines to compare selected portions of submitted papers to\r\n  content on the web.\r\nIn the context of programming, they compare each student's program to those\r\n  submitted by his/her classmates (for this quarter, and any previous\r\n  quarters if the assignment has been repeated).\r\nThis software does not compare programs exactly: it ignores format changes,\r\n  variable name changes, and a variety of well-know transformations that\r\n  change the look of code but not its underlying logic.\r\n<p>\r\nMany courses in ICS use this software to spot potential cheating cases.\r\nOnce it identifies suspicious behavior, instructors carefully examine the\r\n  flagged code to make a final determination as to whether students will be\r\n  prosecuted for cheating.\r\nOften instructors can find additional evidence of cheating, once this\r\n  software points them to the simlar code.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table

occurred.\r\nIf, in the instructor's opinion it has, the instructor will apply appropriate\r\n  disciplinary policy.\r\nIn my courses, for a typical case of cheating, the student will be awarded\r\n  negative credit for the assignment (under the precept that not doing an\r\n  assignment, and receiving no points, is better than cheating on it).\r\nFor particular egregious forms of cheating (e.g., cheating on exams, stealing\r\n  another student's work so he/she cannot submit it for credit), harsher\r\n  consequences may apply (from loss of a full letter grade, through immediate\r\n  failure of the course, up through suspension or expulsion from UCI).\r\n<p>\r\nInstructors must contact the student shortly after investigating evidence of\r\n  academic dishonesty and evaluating the relevant work.\r\nNotice of any action taken by an instructor must also be forwarded to the\r\n  Associate Dean of Student Affairs (ADSA) in ICS and the ADSA of the student's\r\n  home school (if different).\r\nThese offices act as a repository for such information, in case the student\r\n  commits multiple infractions.\r\nWhile the first infraction often results in just a grading penalty, a

Statement</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nCheating undermines the fabric of education.\r\nThe atmosphere at UCI (contrary to whatever opinions, prejudices, or\r\n  superstitions you hold) is one of fostering cooperation between faculty and\r\n  students in the pursuit of learning, knowledge, and wisdom.\r\nThis course, for example, is graded on an absolute scale, not a curve;\r\n  so, helping other students when appropriate doesn't affect your grade.\r\nAnd, if a student cheats for a higher grade, other students do not receive\r\n  lower grades as a result.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough it is embarrassing to fail an assignment, getting caught cheating is\r\n  much worse (and some students get caught cheating for very few points).\r\nI know, though, that students rarely think about getting caught.\r\nBut think about it: I often see students break down and cry when they get\r\n  caught cheating and only then start to realize the consequences of their\r\n  actions.\r\nTheir stress level goes through the roof and it immediately affects both the\r\n  academic and social aspects of their lives.\r\nThe process is distressing for me too, although I must confess that I have been\r\n  hardened by the number of times that I have had to go through it (typically\r\n  multiple times each quarter).\r\nPursuing these cases at the University level takes a lot of my time, and\r\n  reduces the time that I can spend on more important matters relating to my\r\n  course and my students.\r\nIt is definitely a lose-lose situation.\r\n<p>\r\nThe #1 excuse that I hear for cheating is, \"I was pressed for time, so I\r\n  cheated.\"\r\nBy carefully managing your time, you can avoid this problem.\r\nIf you start working early enough, and run into problems (and you should expect\r\n  to run into problems), you will have time for the course staff to help you\r\n  learn to solve them.\r\nAlso, I understand that some students take this course only because it is a\r\n  requirement for their major, and that they have little intrinsic interest in\r\n  the subject area; this is not a valid excuse for cheating either.\r\n<p>\r\nI have seen too many instances recently where student A asks a friend, student\r\n  B, for help; specifically, A asks to see B's quiz or code (on paper or in a\r\n  computer file).\r\nOften, A copies B's code (with or without B's knowledge).\r\nI understand that B feels pressure to give A help.\r\nBut, B is doing A no favor if A's cheating is discovered; B has made a bad \r\n situation (A would receive no credit) worse (A receives negative credit and is\r\n  reported to the Dean of Student Affairs).\r\nAnd, according to UCI's rules, B is violating the Academic Integrity policy\r\n  by these actions too.\r\nI have seen friendships shattered because A copies B's code without telling B\r\n  what was done, and then both get prosecuted under UCI's rules.\r\n<p>\r\nA similar situation arises with cheating on quiz questions.\r\nI have seen too many students cheat on one question on a quiz and receive a\r\n  negative score for the whole quiz (and letter to the Dean of Student\r\n  Student Affairs), when leaving the question blank would result in a small\r\n  point deduction and no university action.\r\n<p>\r\nIn my final statement here, I ask you to pause and reflect on the consequences\r\n  of choosing to cheat at UCI: this includes the impacts that it will have on\r\n  you, your parents, your siblings, your friends, and your fellow classmates\r\n  at UCI.\r\nCheating is invariably the wrong decision.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Policy Exceptions -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"PolicyExceptions\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\"
