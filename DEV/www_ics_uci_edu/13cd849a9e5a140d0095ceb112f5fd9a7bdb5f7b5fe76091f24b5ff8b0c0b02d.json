Interoperable Distributed Simulation</font></H2>\r\n<div style=\"width:90%\"align=\"justify\">\r\nModeling and simulation is required in many areas of science and engineering, for example,\r\nfor predicting the behavior of new systems being designed or for analyzing natural phenomena.\r\nThese simulation systems often require collaborative effort from researchers with\r\ndifferent domain knowledge and expertise, possibly at different locations.\r\nThere are several benefits to distributed simulations:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Reduced execution time - subdividing a large simulation computation into many subcomputations,\r\n     and executing these subcomputations concurrently can reduce execution time.\r\n<li> Geographical distribution - executing the simulation program on a set of geographically\r\n     distributed computers enables one to create virtual worlds with multiple participants\r\n     that are physically located at different sites.\r\n<li> Fault tolerance - if one computer goes down, it may be possible for other computers\r\n     to pick up the work of the failing machine, allowing the simulation computation to proceed despite the failure.\r\n</ol>\r\nThe goal of this project is to design and implement a distributed simulation.\r\nFirst, we study the evolution of distributed simulation tools and standards (e.g. DIS, ALSP and HLA).\r\nThen we take a small and simplified example (simulation model) and try to\r\nidentify all basic issues for distributed simulation through a detailed case study implementation and development.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Project champions: Leila Jalali (jalalil AT uci DOT edu)</i>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<H2 CLASS=\"western\"><font style=\"font-size: 14pt\">B2. Applicability of HLA for Distributed Simulation</font></H2>\r\n<div style=\"width:90%\"align=\"justify\">\r\nThe High Level Architecture (HLA) specification is a standard architecture initiated\r\nby the U.S. Department of Defense to support the interoperability among the distributed simulators.\r\nIn this project we aim to develop a case study to build a distributed simulation using\r\npre-existing simulation models integrated through HLA.While generally within the defence domain\r\nwe can see a big drive in interoperability of simulation models and common application of HLA,\r\nwe are not aware of much effort in other domains. It seems that HLA is still rarely applied as it stands now.\r\nIn this project we want to investigate to find out the reasons behind this phenomenon.\r\nIn the first part of the project we study HLA, its properties, and the existence\r\nof successful projects on integration through HLA. In the second part we build a distributed\r\nsimulation using HLA and identify the problems and difficulties with HLA.\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Project champions: Leila Jalali (jalalil AT uci DOT edu)</i>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<H2 CLASS=\"western\"><font style=\"font-size: 16pt\">C.

(2~3 students)</font></H2>\r\n<div style=\"width:90%\"align=\"justify\">\r\nIn this project, we will implement an application for transmitting data across \r\nmobile devices equipped with multiple access networks. Data in this system can be a short message (say 10 bytes). Nowadays, Android phones are equipped with 2 network interfaces: 3G network and IEEE 802.11 network. While 3G base station can communicate\r\nwith all devices in its coverage, its data rate is low and its resources are valuable. IEEE 802.11 network has a much lower transmission range,\r\nbut its data rate is very high (IEEE 802.11g supports up to 54 Mbps data rate) and its resources are not usually used. \r\nIn our proposed system, we want to use IEEE 802.11 as much as possible and save 3G network's resources. Thus, \r\ntwo devices will communicate with each other using the 802.11 network in IEEE 802.11 transmission range (decentralized mode), \r\nrather than using 3G network (centralized mode). In our application, mobile nodes will notify their presence by \r\nperiodically broadcasting beacons.

Data distribution over hybrid cellular and ad hoc networks (2~3 students)</font></H2>\r\n<div style=\"width:90%\"align=\"justify\">\r\nPure cellular networks usually provide low throughput due to their low data rate. To improve throughput, people \r\ndesign a new kind of network: hybrid cellular and ad hoc network in which base station transmits data to\r\nsome mobile devices which then forward the receiving data to their neighboring nodes. \r\nThis kind of network even supports data distribution from a mobile device to another device through multi-hop path.\r\nIn this project, you will implement a previous work, \r\n\"<a href=\"reading/01644746.pdf\">ICAM: Integrated Cellular and Ad Hoc Multicast</a>\", \r\nfor distributing data over hybrid cellular and ad hoc networks on a packet level simulator - Qualnet. \r\nTo simplify our work, we need to implement only one of two algorithms proposed in the paper:\r\nGreedy algorithm or Near Optimal algorithm. Then you will run some experiments to see how much throughput is\r\nimproved by hybrid networks compared to pure cellular networks?\r\n<br><br>\r\n<i>Project champions: Ngoc Do (nmdo AT uci DOT edu)</i>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p></p><H2 CLASS=\"western\"><font style=\"font-size: 14pt\">C4.

We have considered\r\ntwo-tier model for cloud. The first one is the public and backbone\r\nclouds and the other one is private cloud and data centers. We\r\nproposed a middleware solution which optimally could breakdown the\r\napplication workflow between cloud and smart phones. An example of an\r\napplication using this middleware: we have considered an intensive\r\nimage processing application. As part of this project, we will develop a service \r\ncalled Image Processing Web Service.

Projects on Energy harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks</font></H2>\r\n<div style=\"width:90%\"align=\"justify\">\r\nEnergy harvesting systems are able to harvest energy from the surrounding environment. One example is harvesting energy from the sun. \r\nIn this project, we consider a network of sensor nodes, each powered by a solar cell. Sensor nodes collect data and send to a base station at \r\nsome frequency/rate. A challenge is that solar energy varies greatly, both in term of location and time. \r\nThe goal of these two projects is to understand the impact and exploit temporal and spatial availability of harvested solar energy on data transmission applications.\r\n The first step is to simulate this solar harvesting network in a network simulator assuming a simple application sensing and sending data at a fixed rate. \r\n You then measure performance by metrics such as actual data transmission rate, package loss\u2026 under different solar profiles (sunny day, rainy day, solar-exposed location, \r\n shadow location\u2026).\r\n </div>\r\n<p></p><H2 CLASS=\"western\"><font style=\"font-size: 14pt\">D1.

Projects on Clustering Schemes in Multinetwork</font></H2>\r\n<div style=\"width:90%\"align=\"justify\">\r\nA multinetwork environment consists wired network, wireless LAN, wireless sensor network, \r\nwireless mesh network, and wireless ad hoc network, etc. Nodes in multinetwork environment \r\ninclude mobile devices, sensors (fixed or mobile), wireless network components \r\n(access point, routers, mesh routers, and etc.). Devices communicate using specific wireless protocols \r\nsuch as 802.11, ad hoc protocol, mesh protocol and broadcast protocol. \r\nMuch of the existing researches address organization and topology management in single wired or \r\nwireless network.  An efficient framework for organizing nodes in multinetwork environment is needed. \r\nOur focus here is on dealing multiple wireless network than coexist in a given space to exchange \r\ndata among nodes in a timely, reliable and efficient manner. \r\n\r\nWe adopt clustering as the basic organization method in that frame work. \r\nIn a clustering scheme the mobile nodes in an ad hoc network are divided into different \r\nvirtual groups based on their geographic proximity. Under a cluster structure, mobile nodes \r\nmay be assigned a different status or function, such as cluster head, cluster gateway, or cluster member. \r\nA cluster head normally serves as a local coordinator for its cluster, performing intra-cluster \r\ntransmission arrangement, data forwarding, and so on. A cluster gateway is a non-cluster head node \r\nwith inter-cluster links, so it can access neighboring clusters and forward information between clusters. \r\nA cluster member is usually called an ordinary node, which is a non-cluster head node without \r\nany inter-cluster links. Cluster scheme has several advantages: First, a cluster structure facilitates \r\nthe spatial reuse of resources to increase the system capacity. The second benefit is the generation \r\nand spreading of routing information can be restricted in this set of nodes. Last, local changes need\r\n not be seen and updated by the entire network, and information processed and stored by each mobile node \r\n is greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nClustering mechanisms can be designed to optimize various aspects of communication, i.e. \r\nreduced latency, messaging overhead, and/or energy consumption.\r\n\r\nThe following projects focus on building clustering schemes that optimize latency and energy.\r\n</div>\r\n<p></p><H2 CLASS=\"western\"><font style=\"font-size: 14pt\">E1.
