submitted code.\r\nBut many students altered the files in such a way that this could not be done.\r\nAs a result I asked the TAs just to examine the code and not run it.\r\nThe downside is that code that didn't work could still get full credit, with\r\n  no indication of what was wrong; also there weren't papers to return that\r\n  were marked up.\r\nWhen we do this for the next and final quiz, I will be more specific about\r\n  how to edit the modules in which you will write your classes.\r\n<p>\r\nYou can examine the grades/problem in\r\n   <a

return your written quizzes on Tuesday.\r\nPlease ensure that your grades are recorded correctly.\r\nI'll be entering thousands of grades for students in my courses this quarter,\r\n  so even if I'm 99% accurate, I'm likely to record some incorrect grades.\r\nNote that all grades are recorded as integral values: I always round up\r\n  (e.g., a quiz score of 22.5 is recorded as 23).\r\n<p>\r\nIf you believe that the TA has graded any of your work incorrectly, I encourage\r\n  you to see him/her immediately about the discrepancy (in the case of\r\n  programming assignments, you will always see your TA too).\r\nSuch a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either he will agree with you\r\n that you deserve more credit (and, we do want you to receive all the credit\r\n that you are due), or you will come to understand the question, program, or\r\n  solution better.\r\nThis is certainly a win-win situation.\r\nIn any case, carefully examine my solution before you come to see him.\r\nAlso, because of the size of this class, if you have a grading issue, you must\r\n  bring it to TAs attention within a week of when I return the materials.\r\n<p>\r\nThe TAs reported that many students did not test/debug their code in Eclipse.\r\nSome students didn't know how to use the <b>raise</b> statement to raise\r\n  exceptions, but instead tried to use <b>try/except</b> statements\r\n  (which handle exceptions, not raise them).\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\"

recorded the grades for) the midterm exam\r\nThe class average was about 73% and the median was about 76%.\r\nThe grades recorded in the spreadsheet are the actual exam grades.\r\nBecause the average was below 75%, about 3 normalization points are used in\r\n  computing the average of all graded instruments.\r\nAditi graded problems 1, 2, 5, and 10; Bailey graded 4, 6, 7, and 9; Yen graded\r\n  problems 3 and 8.\r\n<p>\r\nThe approximate distribution of grades on the midterm, after normalization,\r\n  is 25% As, 23% Bs, 17% Cs, 16% Ds, and 20% Fs.\r\n(the last time I taught this class the numbers were:\r\n     20% As, 19% Bs, 18% Cs, 28% Ds, and 15% Fs).\r\nThe lab averages were Lab 1 73 (quiz average 71), Lab 2 77 (quiz average 76),\r\n  Lab 3 75 (quiz average 76), Lab 4 73 (quiz average 69), and Lab 5 69\r\n  (quiz average 80).\r\n<p>\r\nNow is a good time to look at course grades as well, as you have now taken\r\n  about half of the total number of testing instruments (475 of 1,000 points\r\n  total): so this is the first time that recorded grades are meaningful.\r\nThe approximate distribution of course grades (for those student who submitted\r\n  a midterm exam) is is 31% As, 33% Bs, 17% Cs, and 19% Ds and Fs, which is\r\n  close to my speculation of 25% in each of these categories.\r\n(the last time I taught this class the numbers at this point were:\r\n                        24% As, 39% Bs, 22% Cs, and 15% Ds and Fs).\r\n<p>\r\nAfter we return your graded work in lab on Thursday, please download the \r\n  <b>Grades(zipped .xlsm file)</b> from the course web

you on whether you have mastered the\r\n   basics of using Python in Eclipse (and know the course web, via the survey\r\n   questions).\r\n It was also designed to see if you could follow instructions and ask\r\n    questions: more on that below.\r\n<p>\r\nThe class avereage was 24 (or about 98%) and the median was 26\r\n   (or about 104%).\r\nThe assignment was not meant to be hard, but it was not trivial either, and\r\n  there were many opportunities to lose points.\r\nNow that we are on to real programming assignments, I expect you are gaining\r\n  more familiarity with Eclipse and having an easier time using it.\r\n<p>\r\nLet me talk about what will probably be the most contentious single point of\r\n  the 1,000 points that this course is worth (thus .1% of the grade): the point\r\n  was lost by 36 students (or about 20%).\r\nI took off 1 point if you corrected the misspelling <b>Inteprxter</b> (and\r\n  two points if you didn't have either spelling: in this second case you\r\n  obvious failed to meet the specifications because you did not print what was\r\n  required).\r\nWhen some students hear about this point deduction, their heads explode and\r\n  they cannot believe that I am taking off a point for correcting what you\r\n  thought was my mistake.\r\nBut... I am trying to foster an atmosphere where nothing is taken for granted in\r\n  the instructions I give: if anything seems confusing or plain wrong, I should\r\n  be questioned about it -preferably in public, so others can learn about the\r\n  problem and the correction.\r\nFor some background, check out Mr. Lill in the course overview.\r\n<p>\r\nSome students did ask me in class if they should correct the misspelling, and I\r\n  told them no; some students asked me by email if they should correct the\r\n  misspelling, and I told them no; if anyone would have asked on the Forum\r\n  whether they should have corrected the misspelling, I would have responded\r\n  no on the Forum (which some students would have read).\r\nIt is critical for programmers to be sure they know the specifications of the\r\n  problem they are being asked to solve, otherwise they will solve, test, debug\r\n  document, etc. the problem incorrectly, and another cycle of development will\r\n  be needed to fix the misconceptions.\r\nThe overview lecture included a graph that showed that the later in development\r\n  a problem is found, the harder/more expensive it is to fix.\r\nSo if we can find problems at  the time we are reading the specification of the\r\n  problem to solve, that can save us a lot of work/money later.\r\n<p>\r\nThe bottom line is that you are responsible for reading the instructions\r\n  carefully and reporting any confusion so that I can clear it up (best reported\r\n  on the MessageBoard Forum for Programming Assignments).\r\nOf course, you can freely talk to anyone about the problem specifications, just\r\n  not the code you write for your solutions.\r\nIf you make any assumptions and don't ask about them, they might come back\r\n  later to haunt you (gradewise).\r\nWhen working with a partner, you'll have two eyes reading the specification.\r\nI am willing to deduct a point from many students to get across this\r\n  perspective.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMPORTANT</b>\r\nYen Thi Hai Hoang is the reader/grader for this course and will be grading the\r\n  programs (I'll post a picture of her soon on Facts web page).\r\nIf you believe that we recorded one or more answers incorrectly, please\r\n  <b>email her</b> (ythoang@uci.edu) and arrange a meeting in Lab\r\n  to discuss the program.\r\nPlease read the comments in the <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully\r\n  <b>before</b> contacting the Reader and ensure you understand the correct\r\n  answers.\r\nShe will then re-examine your submission, possibly asking you for more\r\n  information if there is still confusion, or talking to you during the lab\r\n  meeting.\r\nIf there is a difference, she will email me a revised summary about\r\n  your program, and cc a copy to you.\r\nI will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of\r\n  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade).\r\nIf you feel there is still a problem after talking to the reader, please\r\n  contact me (but always contact the reader first).\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>\r\n  #3: 4/14/13<br>\r\n  Quiz #1\r\n</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI have graded (and recorded the grades for) Quiz #1.\r\nThe class average was about 21 (or about 86%); the median was 22 (or about\r\n  88%).\r\nLook at your returned work carefully; if your score was below 20 (many were)\r\n  you might want to review this quiz with me or a TA.\r\nMaterial similar to this will be on the first written exam.\r\nAlways see your TA first for grading issues with Quizzes and Programming\r\n  Assignments.\r\n<p>\r\nExamine the grades spreadsheet that is available from the index on the\r\n  course web: it records all the grades for all the testing instruments that I\r\n  assign over the quarter.\r\nIt is sorted by <b>Unique ID</b>.\r\nTo compute your <b>Unique ID</b>, go to the grades spreadsheet and go to the\r\n  tab labeled <b>UniqueID</b> and enter your ID in the green cell (A2):\r\n  your <b>Unique ID</b> will appear to the right, in cell B2.\r\nYou will notice that all numbers are rounded up to integers: so receiving a\r\n  27.5 on your quiz will translate into a 28 in this spreadsheet.\r\nWe will use this same process for recording all grades during the quarter.\r\n<p>\r\nThe TAs will return your written quizzes on Tuesday.\r\nPlease ensure that your grades are recorded correctly.\r\nI'll be entering thousands of grades for students in my courses this quarter,\r\n  so even if I'm 99% accurate, I'm likely to record some incorrect grades.\r\nNote that all grades are recorded as integral values: I always round up\r\n  (e.g., a quiz score of 22.5 is recorded as 23).\r\n<p>\r\nIf you believe that the TA has graded any of your work incorrectly, I encourage\r\n  you to see him/her immediately about the discrepancy (in the case of\r\n  programming assignments, you will always see your TA too).\r\nSuch a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either he will agree with you\r\n that you deserve more credit (and, we do want you to receive all the credit\r\n that you are due), or you will come to understand the question, program, or\r\n  solution better.\r\nThis is certainly a win-win situation.\r\nIn any case, carefully examine my solution before you come to see him.\r\nAlso, because of the size of this class, if you have a grading issue, you must\r\n  bring it to TAs attention within a week of when I return the materials.\r\n<p>\r\nGenerally exams (written and programming) and quizzes are graded more closely\r\n  than programming assignments.\r\nIf the average on any testing instrument is less than 75%, the column for\r\n  that instrument will show the number of normalization points: the number of\r\n  points each student would have needed to earn to have that instrument's\r\n  average be 75%: these number of points are then added to the sum of the\r\n  points for each student (in a later column).\r\nThis is the only curving I do in grading.\r\nOn this testing instrument (and typically most others, except the written and\r\n  programming exams), the normalization points are 0.\r\n<p>\r\nHere were some common mistakes:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Problem 1: Many students either left out one or two lines needed in the\r\n        syntax chart (some omitted it altogether) or incorrectly computed\r\n        whether a few words were <b>Legal</b> or <b>Illegal</b> according the\r\n        EBNF or syntax chart.\r\n      Note that there is a differnce between the optional choice <b>[+|-]</b>\r\n        and a 3-rung ladder that looks like a choice<b>+|-|</b> with one\r\n        option empty.\r\n  <p>    \r\n  <li>Problem 2: Some students got this completely correct while others had\r\n        close solutions; some not so close answers.\r\n      Some had \"useless rules\" (e.g., comma &lt;= , just use the , in another\r\n        rule) or minor or major bugs in their EBNF rules:\r\n        <b>name-sequence <= name{, name} and name</b> was\r\n        common, but that  doesn't allow just one <b>name</b>; likewise, the\r\n        rule <b>name-sequence <= name{, name}[and name]</b> does allow\r\n        <b>Bob, Bob</b> when it shouldn't.\r\n      <!---\r\n      Some students wrote only the Right Hand Side of the rule, not the\r\n        Left Hand Side nor \"is defined as\" arrow.--->\r\n      There were a few students who specified a Right Hand Side without using\r\n        <b>name</b>, some didn't include commas nor the word \"and\"; these\r\n        students appear lost about synthesizing EBNF descriptions.\r\n  <p>    \r\n  <li>Problem 3: Some students did get this completely correct, while others\r\n        had lots of small mistakes: some students didn't put in enough vertical\r\n        lines to separate all the tokens; others did not write the categories\r\n        on top, or include the types of the literals.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>\r\n  #2: 3/31/14<br>\r\n  Install Course Software\r\n</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  All students with computers should download and install the course Software:\r\n    Java (to run Eclipse), Python, and Eclipse.\r\n  All three products are available for free on the internet.\r\n  Students can view instructions for downloading and installing this software\r\n    by following then\r\n    <a href=\"../common/online.html\" target=\"main\">Course Software</a>\r\n    link.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Although students can work on their programming assignments on the computers\r\n    in the UCI labs, I expect students with computers to download and instal\r\n    this software by the end of the first week of the quarter.\r\n  If you are having difficulty with this task, the TAs and Lab Tutors will help\r\n    you during the first Lab meeting (or beyond, if necessary: bring your\r\n    computer to the lab);
