Some of the \nrecent material on Deep Blue is reworded from material on <A \nHREF=\"http://www.chess.ibm.com/\">IBM's web site</A>.  Other sources include \nweb sites linked to by this page.\n\n<P><B>1950</B>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nClaude E. Shannon writes the first article on computer chess: &quot;Programming a computer \nfor playing chess&quot;, Philosophical Magazine 41:256-275. \nHe writes &quot;Although perhaps of no practical importance, \nthe question is of theoretical interest, and it is \nhoped that a satisfactory solution of this problem \nwill act as a wedge in attacking other problems of \na similar nature and of greater significance&quot;. \n Modern chess programs still follow the lines laid \nout by Shannon.\n\n<P>\nShannon notes the theoretical existence of a perfect solution \nto chess and \nthe practical impossibility of finding it.  He describes \ntwo general strategies, both based an a heuristic &quot;evaluation \nfunction&quot; for guessing whether a position is in \nfavor of one person or the other:\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n<I>Shannon Type A</I> - \nexpand all sequences of possible moves out to a fixed \n&quot;horizon&quot; (number of levels), combine the \nevaluations of these sequences in a simple tree computation \n(&quot;minimax&quot;), use the combined evaluation \nto choose the best move.\n\n<P><I>Shannon Type B</I> - only perform \nselective expansion of certain lines, using knowledge \nto prune uninteresting branches. For example, Turing's 1951 program only \nexpanded lines involving captures.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nShannon thought that \ntype B was clearly better but debate still continues \ntoday (you can find proponents of both sides on \nrec.games.chess.computer).  Shannon's evaluation combines \nterms for material (P=1, N=B=3, R=5, Q=9) and positional \nadvantages, similar to modern evaluation functions.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><B>1951</B>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nAlan Turing describes and hand-simulates a computer \nchess program of type B. Play best described as &quot;aimless&quot;; \nloses to weak player.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><B>1956</B>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nType A program (for simplified 6x6 chess variant) \nimplemented on MANIAC-1 (11Khz, 600 words of mem) computer \nat Los Alamos.

It runs on a PDP-10 (1Mhz), and examines 120 positions/second.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><B>1973</B>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nUntil this point, most or all chess programs have been of type B.\nProgrammers Slate and Atkin, revising their overly complicated chess \nprogram in preparation for the 1973 Computer Chess Championships,\nreturn to a type A search routine.  Their program\nChess 4.0 wins, and\nother programmers start to switch from type B to type \nA. On a CDC 6400 a later version (Chess 4.5) processes \nfrom 270 to 600 positions/second.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><B>1975</B>\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cis.uab.edu/info/faculty/hyatt/hyatt.html\">Robert \nHyatt</A> begins developing Cray Blitz, for a long time the fastest program \nand from 1983-1989 the world computer chess champion.  As of 1983 it was \nsearching 40-50K positions/second, only a little slower than current \nprograms on fast pentiums.
