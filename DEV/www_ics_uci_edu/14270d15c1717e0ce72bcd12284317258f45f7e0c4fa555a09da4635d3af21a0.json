Special\nemphasis on the need for and use of teamwork, careful planning, and other\ntechniques for working with large systems.\n<h3>\nCourse Description (Redmiles' version)</h3>\nICS 121, Introduction to Software Engineering, focused on the conceptual\nissues of software development: problem analysis, definition, lifecycle\nconsiderations, verification and validation, requirements specification,\nand architectural design. In this class, we will focus on applying these\nconcepts in a realistic problem setting. Students will work in teams to\ncarry a project through all the phases of software development, from problem\ndefinition to implementation. The problems are drawn from actual industry\nand research domains. The experience is crucial in developing skills for\nteam efforts and application-specific processes. No two project teams are\nexactly alike and no two projects follow exactly the same development process\nin detail. In class presentations by teams and discussion will help all\nto understand the commonalities and differences and learn from the variety\nof projects.\n<h3>\nAdd/Drop Policy</h3>\nNo drops after Friday in Week 2 (except for medical reasons)\n<h3>\nPrerequisites</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nICS 51 (Grade C or better)</li>\n\n<li>\nICS 121 and ICS 141</li>\n\n<li>\nMATH 2A-B-C</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\nGrading</h3>\nA variety of project topics will be introduced during the first and second weeks of class. You will be split into teams of about 5 students each, bidding\non and being assigned a project in the second week. You will implement\nthe project through a series of 5 assignments (see below) that will constitute\n75% of the Grade. The next 20% of the grade will be determined by a variety\nof assignments including occasional in class updates. There will be a final\nconstituting the remaining 5% of the grade. Normally, team members will\nall receive the same grade.\n<p>The five major assignments constituting the term project are as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>\nProject Bid (Due Week 3, Monday, 5% Grade)</li>\n\n<li>\nProblem Analysis and Requirements (Due Week 4, 15% Grade)</li>\n\n<li>\nPrototype (Due Week 5, 10% Grade)</li>\n\n<li>\nArchitectural Design (Due Week 6, 20% Grade)</li>\n\n<li>\nFinal Project (Due Finals Week, 25% Grade)</li>\n</ol>\nAdditional assignments constituting 20% of the grade are as follows:\n<ol>\n<li>\nIndividual Web Page (Due Week 2, Monday)</li>\n\n<li>\nTeam Web Page (Due Week 4, Monday)</li>\n\n<li>\nProject Updates (TBA)</li>\n\n<li>\nTeam Logs ( Due weekly beginning Week 4, Monday)</li>\n</ol>\nThere will be a final worth 5% of the grade\n<h3>\nOptional Text</h3>\nThe course assumes that you have already read <u>The Mythical Man-Month</u>\nin ICS 121.\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nBrooks, F. (1995). <u>The Mythical Man-Month. (Anniversary Edition).</u>\nReading, MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\nComputer Usage</h3>\nProject implementation platforms will vary by project, although some platforms\nwill be recommended. Teams will be given offices to meet.\n<p>You should check the class bulletin board ics.125a (or ics.125b) daily,&nbsp;\nfor updates, news messages, etc.\n<h3>\nAcademic Dishonesty</h3>\nAcademic Dishonesty in ICS 125 will be dealt with in accordance with <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics125-WQ00/adp.html\">ICS\npolicy</a>.
