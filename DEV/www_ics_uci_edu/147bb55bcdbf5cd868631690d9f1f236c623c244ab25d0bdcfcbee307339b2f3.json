We investigate a new objective\nfunction that minimizes the sum of the number of acknowledgements sent\nand the maximum delay incurred for any of the packets.\nWe develop a deterministic online algorithm that achieves a competitive\nratio of &pi;<sup>2</sup>/6 and prove that no deterministic algorithm\ncan have a smaller competitiveness.  We also study a generalized\nobjective function where delays are taken to the <i>p</i>th power.\nFinally, we show lower bounds for randomized algorithms on these problems.</p>\n\n<p>(From a SODA 2003 paper by Susanne Albers and Helge Bals.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
