I started at UCI in Fall 2018.</p>\n<p>MS expected: Spring 2020. PhD expected: 2023.</p>\n<p>See my <a href=\"cv.pdf\">CV</a> for professional experience.</p>\n\n<h2>Research</h2>\nMy current and recent research includes hierarchical clustering algorithms and their relationship to combinatorial optimization problems; a graph simplification problem; studying the graphs that arise from configurations in a game involving pegs and disks (Towers of Hanoi); and a problem motivated by drawing aesthetically pleasing (Lombardi) graphs.\n<h2>Publications</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>N.
