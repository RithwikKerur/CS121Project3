We\ngive a linear-time algorithm to obtain an orderly pair (H,T) of G, where H\nis a planar embedding of G, and T is an orderly spanning Tree of H.  As\napplications, we show that the technique of orderly spanning trees yields\n(i) the best known encoding of G with query support, and (ii) the first\narea-optimal 2-visibility drawing of G.\n<p>\nThis paper, by Yi-Ting Chiang, Ching-Chi Lin, and Hsueh-I Lu,\nwas presented at the 2001 Symposium on Discrete Algorithms.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
