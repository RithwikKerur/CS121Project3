The X.500 DS is designed to provide a single,\nend-user browsable, people-oriented hierarchical directory with\nlocality-based (national/regional) administration.  This design led to\nnaming based on natural names of persons, localities, and\norganizations.  The goals of the X.500 Directory have, with some\nexceptions, been superseded by other technologies or abandoned.\nLDAP-based directory services, while rooted in X.500, are designed\ninstead to support institutional-scale system management and\nobject-sharing.  Requirements on object representation and naming for\nthis purpose are quite different, focussing on stability, program\naccess, and representation of complex relationships.  This is perhaps\na retreat from Internet-scale problems; support for large-scale\nconsistency may emerge, Internet-style, from cooperating local\narrangements.  Naming of LDAP schema objects (classes and attributes)\nalso has large-scale namespace issues.\n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/twist/twist99/\">\nTWIST 99</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
