Our codes for <i>n</i> users\nthat are &epsilon;-secure against <i>c</i> pirates have length\nO(<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;log(<i>n</i>/&epsilon;)).This improves\nthe codes proposed by Boneh and Shaw whose length is approximately\nthe square of this length. Our codes use the full power of\nrandomization. This improvement carries over to works using the Boneh-\nShaw code as a primitive, e.g. to the dynamic traitor tracing scheme of\nTassa.</p>\n\n<p>By proving matching lower bounds we establish that the length of our\ncodes is best within a constant factor for reasonable error\nprobabilities. This lower bound generalizes the bound found\nindependently by Peikert, Shelat, and Smith that applies to a limited\nclass of codes. Our results also imply that randomized fingerprint codes\nover a binary alphabet are as powerful as over an arbitrary alphabet and\nthe equal strength of two distinct models for fingerprinting.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
