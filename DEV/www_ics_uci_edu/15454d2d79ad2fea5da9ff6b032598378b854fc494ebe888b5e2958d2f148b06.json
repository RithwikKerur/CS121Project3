Your success at \nanything you do as an educated person will depend on your ability to write \ncoherently.  \n  <p>This kind of good writing is made, not born; you have to work \nat it, practicing continually.  Classes that require written assignments \nand projects are a perfect opportunity to sharpen these skills; avoiding \nthem is a cowardly mistake.</li>\n<p>\n<li>\nRead everything you can get your hands \non\u2014not just textbooks, but fiction, magazines, and newspapers.  Reading \nwill help you become a better writer, and will widen your knowledge far \nbeyond what you can experience personally.  \n<p>Instead of watching the TV \nnews, read the newspaper; instead of entertainment TV, read an entertaining \nnovel.  \n<p>Someone who doesn't read is hardly better off than someone who \ncan't read.</li>\n<p>\n<li>\nTake as wide a variety of courses as you can\u2014not just in \nyour major, but from every corner of the campus.  \n<p>You should use your \nundergraduate years as an opportunity to learn about the world, about the \nachievements and diversity of humanity.  After you graduate, you will find \nyourself concentrating more on your career and your family, but while \nyou're here at UCI, it couldn't be easier: Just sign up for a course, be it \nbotany, Russian drama, art history, or Chinese politics.  \n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of UCI's \ngreatest strengths is its diversity; take advantage of it, and good \nluck!</p>\n<hr>\n<address>\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay\">\nDavid G.
