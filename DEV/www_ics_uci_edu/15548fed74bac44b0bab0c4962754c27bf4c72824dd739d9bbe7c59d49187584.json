Properties are data about data. The term property is\r\nused within this specification to disambiguate the concept from\r\nthe overloaded terms \"metadata\" and \"attribute\".\r\n\r\n<P>Properties are used within distributed authoring environments to\r\nprovide for efficient discovery and management of resources. For\r\nexample, a 'subject' property might allow for the indexing of all\r\nresources by their subject, and an 'author' property might allow\r\nfor the discovery of what authors have written which documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.1.2     Existing Metadata Proposals</h4>\r\n\r\nProperties have a long played an essential role in the\r\nmaintenance of large document repositories, and many current\r\nproposals contain some notion of a property. These include PICS\r\n[Miller et al., 1996], PICS-NG, the Rel/Rev draft [Maloney,\r\n1996], Web Collections, XML [Bray, Sperberg-McQueen, 1997],\r\nseveral proposals on representing relationships within HTML,\r\ndigital signature manifests (DCMF), and a position paper on Web\r\nmetadata architecture [Berners-Lee, 1997].\r\n\r\n<P>Some proposals come from a digital library perspective. These\r\ninclude the Dublin Core [Weibel et al., 1995] metadata set and\r\nthe Warwick Framework [Lagoze, 1996], a container architecture\r\nfor different metadata schemas. The literature includes many\r\nexamples of metadata, including MARC [MARC, 1994], a\r\nbibliographic metadata format, RFC 1807 [Lasher, Cohen, 1995], a\r\ntechnical report bibliographic format employed by the Dienst\r\nsystem, and the proceedings from the first IEEE Metadata\r\nconference describe many community-specific metadata sets.\r\n\r\n<P>Participants of the 1996 Metadata II Workshop in Warwick, UK\r\n[Lagoze, 1996], noted that, \"new metadata sets will develop as\r\nthe networked infrastructure matures\" and \"different communities\r\nwill propose, design, and be responsible for different types of\r\nmetadata.\" These observations can be corroborated by noting that\r\nmany community-specific sets of metadata already exist, and there\r\nis significant motivation for the development of new forms of\r\nmetadata as many communities increasingly make their data\r\navailable in digital form, requiring a metadata format to assist\r\ndata location and cataloging.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.1.3     Properties and HTTP Headers</h4>\r\n\r\nProperties already exist, in a limited sense, within HTTP through\r\nthe use of message headers. However, in distributed authoring\r\nenvironments a relatively large number of properties are needed\r\nto describe the state of a resource, and setting/returning them\r\nall through HTTP headers is inefficient. Thus a mechanism is\r\nneeded which allows a principal to identify a set of properties\r\nin which the principal is interested and to then set or retrieve\r\njust those properties.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2.2  A Property Model for HTTP Resources</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>2.2.1     Overview</h4>\r\n\r\nThe DAV property model is based on name/value doubles. The name\r\nof a property identifies the property's syntax and semantics, and\r\nprovides an address with which to refer to a property. The name\r\nand value of a property is expressed as a well-formed XML\r\nelement, where the name of the property is the name of the XML\r\nelement, and the value of the property MUST be either blank, or a\r\nwell-formed XML element value.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.2.2     Property Namespace</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>2.2.2.1   Problem Definition</H4>\r\n\r\nThe requirement is to be able to associate a value with a\r\nproperty name on a resource.  It must be possible to associate a\r\nURL with the property name.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>2.2.2.2   Solution Requirement</H4>\r\n\r\nIdeally a property namespace should work well with extant\r\nproperty implementations as well as database systems. The DAV\r\nproperty namespace has been specified with the following two\r\nfacts in mind:\r\n<LI>    Namespaces associated with flat file systems are ubiquitous.\r\n<LI>    The majority of databases use a fixed schema mechanism.\r\nThe last point makes efficient implementation of hierarchical\r\nproperties difficult. Specifically, each property has a random\r\nset of children; the best a relational database can do is provide\r\na table with name and value, where the value is a series of\r\nindexes into other tables and each index represents a specific\r\nvalue. However most RDBS do not provide for table pointers, only\r\nindex values. Such a system would have to be jury-rigged to\r\nhandle table pointers. In addition, indexing systems are\r\noptimized for a small set of relatively large tables;\r\nhierarchical property systems tend toward many properties, each\r\nwith different numbers and types of children, thus potentially\r\nrequiring a table for each child.\r\n\r\n<P>It would seem best to implement a flat property namespace,\r\ninducing a natural isomorphism between DAV and most native file\r\nsystems. Adopting such a model will not restrict RDBS from taking\r\nfull advantage of their search facilities.\r\n\r\n<P>However, it seems that future trends might be toward hierarchical\r\nproperties. Therefore, DAV requirements [Slein et al.] stipulate\r\nthat the design of the flat property system MUST be such that it\r\nwill be possible to add true hierarchical properties later\r\nwithout breaking downlevel clients. Specifically, a flat client\r\nMUST be able to speak to a hierarchical server and a hierarchical\r\nclient MUST be able to speak to a flat server. Worst case either\r\nway MUST be that the request fails.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>2.2.2.3   Property Names</H4>\r\n\r\nA property name identifies both the syntax and semantics of the\r\nproperty's value. It is critical that property names do not\r\ncollide, e.g., two principals defining the same property name\r\nwith two different meanings.\r\n\r\n<P>The URI framework provides a mechanism to prevent namespace\r\ncollision and for varying degrees of administrative control.\r\nRather than reinvent these desirable features, DAV properties\r\nmake use of them by requiring that all DAV property names MUST be\r\nURIs.  Since a property is also an XML element, the name of the\r\nXML element is a URI.\r\n\r\n<P>The property namespace is flat, that is, it is not possible to\r\nstring together a series of property names in order to refer to a\r\nhierarchy of properties. Thus it is possible to refer to a\r\nproperty B but not a property A/B, where A is also a property\r\ndefined on the resource.\r\n\r\n<P>Finally, it is not possible to define the same property twice as\r\nthis would cause a collision in the resource's property\r\nnamespace.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2.3  Schemas</h3>\r\n\r\nA schema is a group of property names and XML elements.\r\n\r\n<P>Schema discovery is used to determine if a system supports a\r\ngroup of properties or XML elements. A property does not\r\nnecessarily contain sufficient information to identify any\r\nschema(s) to which it may belong.\r\n\r\n<P>As with property names, schemas MUST use URIs as their names.\r\n\r\n<P>A resource declares its support for a schema by defining a\r\nproperty whose name is the same as the schema's. The property\r\nSHOULD contain the PropSchema XML element.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.3.1     PropSchema XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropSchema\r\n<BR>Purpose:  To provide information about properties\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent:   Any\r\n<BR>Values=   [DTD] [DefinedProps]\r\n<BR>Description:This property contains the definition of the schema.\r\nThis definition consists of two parts. A DTD element that\r\ncontains a DTD that declares all XML elements and DefinedProps\r\nthat defines any properties associated with the schema. As with\r\nall XML it is possible to add extra XML elements. Therefore\r\nschemas may define extra XML elements which are to be included\r\nwith their values.\r\n\r\n<h4>2.3.2     DTD XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/DTD\r\n<BR>Purpose:  To contain the DTD for XML elements associated with the\r\nschema.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent:   Any\r\n<BR>Values:   XML Declaration statements\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.3.3     DefinedProps XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/DefinedProps\r\n<BR>Purpose:  To contain a list of properties defined by the schema.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent:   Any\r\n<BR>Values=   1*PropEntries\r\n\r\n<h4>2.3.4     PropEntries XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropEntries\r\n<BR>Purpose:  To contain the name of a defined property, the DTD of\r\nits value, and its live/dead status.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent:   DefinedProps\r\n<BR>Values=   Prop [DTD] [Live]\r\n<BR>Description:Prop contains the name of the property. The DTD\r\ncontains the DTD of the property's value. Live, if defined,\r\nindicates that the property has semantics and syntax that are\r\nenforced by the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.3.5     Live XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/Live\r\n<BR>Purpose:  If present this indicates the server MUST enforce the\r\nsyntax and semantics of the property.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent:   PropEntries\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2.4  DAV Schema</h3>\r\n\r\nThe DAV Schema is specified as\r\nhttp://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/. This schema is used to\r\nindicate support for\r\n<LI>    properties that may be defined on a resource and\r\n<LI>    XML elements that may be returned in responses.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.4.1     DAV Property</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav\r\n<BR>Purpose:  Defines support for the DAV schema and protocol.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Values=   PropSchema Level\r\n<BR>Description:This property indicates that the resource supports\r\nthe DAV schema and protocol to the level indicated. THE VALUE IN\r\nPROPSCHEMA IS TBD, WE NEED TO PROVIDE IT IN AN APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.4.2     Level XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/level\r\n<BR>Purpose:  To indicate the level of DAV compliance the resource\r\nmeets.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent:   DAV\r\n<BR>Values=   \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\"\r\n<BR>Description:A value of 1 for level indicates that the resource\r\nsupports the property and namespace sections of the DAV\r\nspecification. Level 2 indicates that the resource supports level\r\n1 and the lock section of the specification, with a minimum\r\nlocking capability of the write lock. Level 3 indicates support\r\nfor levels 1 and 2 as well as support for the versioning section\r\nof the DAV specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.4.3     Prop XML element</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/prop\r\n<BR>Purpose:  Contains properties related to a resource.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent:   Any\r\n<BR>Values:   XML Elements\r\n<BR>Description:The Prop XML element is a generic container for\r\nproperties defined on resources. All elements inside Prop MUST\r\ndefine properties related to the resource. No other elements may\r\nbe used inside of a Prop element.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.4.4     PropLoc XML Attribute</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/PropLoc\r\n<BR>Purpose:  To specify the location of the associated property.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Values=   URL\r\n<BR>Description:This attribute is used with elements inside of Props\r\ncontained in responses to specify the URL of the property on the\r\nassociated resource. The PropLoc attribute MUST NOT be used in\r\nrequests.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.4.5     Example</h4>\r\n\r\n<PRE>&lt;?XML:Namespace href=\"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" AS=\"D\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;?XML:Namespace href=\"AIIM:Dublin:\" AS=\"A\"/&gt; &lt;D:Prop&gt;\r\n     &lt;A:Author D:PropLoc=\"http://www.foo.com/resource/props/Author\"&gt;\r\n          Larry Masinter\r\n     &lt;/A:Author&gt;\r\n&lt;/D:Prop&gt;\r\n\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nThe previous specifies that the property author exists on some\r\nunspecified resource and that the property can be directly\r\nreferenced at http://www.foo.com/resource/props/Author. The\r\nresource upon which the property is defined must be determined\r\nfrom context.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2.5  Property Identifiers</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.5.1     Problem Definition</h4>\r\n\r\nDAV properties are resources and thus may have a URI where the\r\nvalue of an instance of the property may be retrieved.  This URI\r\nis separate from the URI name of the property, which identifies\r\nthe syntax and semantics of the property, but which does not give\r\ninformation on how to access the value of an instance of the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n<P>A server is free to assign whatever URI it chooses to identify an\r\ninstance of a property defined on a resource. In fact, a server\r\nis free not to reveal the URI of an instance of a particular\r\nresource and instead require that the client access the property\r\nthrough <TT>PROPFIND</TT> and <TT>PROPPATCH</TT>.  However, many servers will want\r\nto allow clients to directly manipulate properties. On these\r\nservers, a client can discover the URI of an instance of a\r\nproperty by performing a <TT>PROPFIND</TT> and examining the PropLoc\r\nattribute, if returned, of each property.\r\n\r\n<h3>2.6  Link XML Element</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>2.6.1     Problem Description</h4>\r\n\r\nA mechanism is needed to associate resources with other\r\nresources. These associations, known as links, consist of three\r\nvalues, a type describing the nature of the association, the\r\nsource of the link, and the destination of the link. In the case\r\nof annotation, neither the source nor the destination of a link\r\nneed be the resource upon which the link is recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.6.2     Solution Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\nThe association mechanism MUST make use of the DAV property\r\nmechanism in order to make the existence of the associations\r\nsearchable.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.6.3     Link XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName:          http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link\r\n<BR>Purpose:  To identify a property as a link and to contain the\r\nsource and destination of that link.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Values=   1*Src 1*Dst\r\n<BR>Description:Link is used to provide the sources and destinations\r\nof a link. The type of the property containing the Link XML\r\nelement provides the type of the link. Link is a multi-valued\r\nelement, so multiple Links may be used together to indicate\r\nmultiple links with the same type.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.6.4     Src XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/src\r\n<BR>Purpose: To indicate the source of a link.\r\n<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link\r\n<BR>Values= URI\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.6.5     Dst XML Element</h4>\r\n\r\nName: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/Dst\r\n<BR>Purpose: To indicate the destination of a link\r\n<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link\r\n<BR>Values= URI\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.6.6     Example</h4>\r\n\r\n<PRE>&lt;?XML:Namespace\r\n     href = \"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" AS = \"D\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;?XML:Namespace\r\n     href = \"http://www.foocorp.com/Project/\" AS = \"F\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;D:Prop&gt;\r\n     &lt;Source&gt;\r\n          &lt;Link&gt;\r\n               &lt;F:ProjFiles&gt;Source&lt;/F:ProjFiles&gt;\r\n               &lt;src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/src&gt;\r\n               &lt;dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/main.c&lt;/dst&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Link&gt;\r\n          &lt;Link&gt;\r\n               &lt;F:ProjFiles&gt;Library&lt;/F:ProjFiles&gt;\r\n               &lt;src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/src&gt;\r\n               &lt;dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/main.lib&lt;/dst&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Link&gt;\r\n          &lt;Link&gt;\r\n               &lt;F:ProjFiles&gt;Makefile&lt;/F:ProjFiles&gt;\r\n               &lt;src&gt;http://foo.bar/program&lt;/src&gt;\r\n               &lt;dst&gt;http://foo.bar/src/makefile&lt;/dst&gt;\r\n     &lt;Link&gt;\r\n     &lt;/Source&gt;\r\n&lt;/D:Prop&gt;\r\n\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nIn this example the resource http://foo.bar/program has a source\r\nproperty defined which contains three links. Each link contains\r\nthree elements, two of which, src and dst, are part of the DAV\r\nschema defined in this document, and one which is defined by the\r\nschema http://www.foocorp.com/project/ (Source, Library, and\r\nMakefile). A client which only implements the elements in the DAV\r\nspec will not understand the foocorp elements and will ignore\r\nthem, thus seeing the expected source and destination links. An\r\nenhanced client may know about the foocorp elements and be able\r\nto present the user with additional information about the links.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>2.7  Multi-Status Response</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.7.1     Problem Definition</h4>\r\n\r\nSome methods effect more than one resource. The effect of the\r\nmethod on each of the scoped resources may be different, as such\r\na return format that can specify the effect of the method on each\r\nresource is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.7.2     Solution Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\nThe solution must:\r\n<LI> communicate the status code and reason\r\n<LI> give the URI of the resource on which the method was invoked\r\n<LI> be consistent with other return body formats\r\n\r\n<h4>2.7.3     Multi-Status Response</h4>\r\n\r\nThe default multi-status response body is an <TT>text/xml</TT> HTTP entity\r\nthat contains a single XML element called <TT>multiresponse</TT>, which\r\ncontains a set of XML elements called response, one for each 200,\r\n300, 400, and 500 series status code generated during the method\r\ninvocation.  100 series status codes MUST NOT be recorded in a\r\nresponse XML element.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>2.7.3.1   <TT>Multiresponse</TT></H4>\r\n\r\nName: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/multiresponse\r\n<BR>Purpose:  Contains multiple response messages.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent:   Any\r\n<BR>Value:    1*Response [ResponseDescription]\r\n<BR>Description:The ResponseDescription at the top level is used to\r\nprovide a general message describing the over arching nature of\r\nthe response.

It is worth\r\npointing out that the deletion of a property effects both direct\r\nmanipulation, that is by the property's URL, as well as indirect\r\ndiscovery and manipulation, that is <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> and <TT>PROPFIND</TT>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.8.2     GET</h4>\r\n\r\nA <TT>GET</TT> with a Request-URI that identifies a property returns the\r\nname and value of that property.  Accept types may be used to\r\nspecify the format of the return value, but all DAV compliant\r\nservers MUST at minimum support a return type of <TT>text/xml</TT>. If\r\n<TT>text/xml</TT> is used as the response format then it MUST return the\r\nname and value of the property using the <TT>Prop</TT> XML element.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>2.8.2.1   Example</H4>\r\n\r\nThe following example assumes that the property's URL, originally\r\ngenerated by the server, was discovered by examining the <TT>proploc</TT>\r\nXML attribute returned on a result from a <TT>FINDPROP</TT>.\r\n<PRE>\r\nGET /bar.html;prop=z39.50_authors HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: foo.com\r\n</PRE>\r\n<PRE>\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/xml\r\nContent-Length: xxxx\r\nE-tag: \"1234\"\r\nLast-Modified: xxxx\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<PRE>&lt;?XML:Namespace href = \"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" AS = \"D\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;?XML:Namespace href = \"http://www.w3.com/standards/z39.50/\"AS = \"Z\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;D:prop&gt;\r\n     &lt;Z:Authors&gt;\r\n          &lt;Z:Author&gt;Jane Doe&lt;/Z:Author&gt;\r\n          &lt;Z:Author&gt;Joe Doe&lt;/Z:Author&gt;\r\n           &lt;Z:Author&gt;Lots o'Doe&lt;/Z:Author&gt;\r\n     &lt;/Z:Authors&gt;\r\n&lt;/D:prop&gt;\r\n\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>2.8.3     <TT>PROPPATCH</TT></h4>\r\n\r\nThe <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> method processes instructions specified in the\r\nrequest body to create and/or remove properties defined on the\r\nresource identified by Request-URI.\r\n\r\n<P>All DAV compliant servers MUST process instructions which are\r\nspecified using the <TT>PropertyUpdate</TT>, <TT>Create</TT>, and <TT>Remove</TT> XML\r\nelements of the DAV schema.

This discussion is a prerequisite for the\r\nspecification of methods that operate on collections, given later\r\nin this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.1.1     Collection Resources</h4>\r\n\r\nA collection is a resource whose state consists of a list of\r\ninternal members, a list of external members, and a set of\r\nproperties.  An internal member resource MUST have a URI that is\r\nimmediately relative to the base URI of the collection, that is,\r\na relative URI in which \"../\" is illegal, which must begin with\r\n\"./\" and which MAY contain only one other \"/\" at the end of the\r\nURI. An external member resource MUST be an absolute URI that is\r\nnot an internal URI.  Any given internal or external URI MUST\r\nonly belong to the collection once, i.e., multiple instances of\r\nURIs in a collection are illegal.  Properties defined on\r\ncollections have no special distinction, and behave exactly as do\r\nproperties on non-collection resources.\r\n\r\n<P>The purpose of a collection resource is to model collection-like\r\nobjects (e.g., a filesystem directory) within a server's\r\nnamespace.  Once these objects have been modeled with\r\ncollections, a client may perform an <TT>INDEX</TT>, add and remove\r\nexternal members using <TT>ADDREF</TT> and <TT>DELREF</TT>, and perform recursive\r\noperations, such as a full hierarchy copy.\r\n\r\n<P>To support methods which operate on collections, a server SHOULD\r\nmodel its collection-like objects with collection resources.  For\r\nexample, a server which is implemented on top of a filesystem\r\nSHOULD treat all filesystem directories exposed by the server as\r\ncollection resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.1.2     Creation and Retrieval of Collection Resources</h4>\r\n\r\nThis document specifies the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method to create new collection\r\nresources, and the <TT>INDEX</TT> method to list their contents.\r\n\r\n<P>In HTTP/1.1, the <TT>PUT</TT> method is defined to store the request body\r\nat the location specified by Request-URI.  While a description\r\nformat for a collection can readily be constructed that could be\r\nused with <TT>PUT</TT>, the implications of sending such a description to\r\nthe server are undesirable.  For example, if a description of a\r\ncollection that omitted some existing resources were <TT>PUT</TT> to a\r\nserver, this might be interpreted as a command to remove those\r\nmembers.  This would extend <TT>PUT</TT> to perform <TT>DELETE</TT> functionality,\r\nwhich is undesirable since it changes the semantics of <TT>PUT</TT>, and\r\nmakes it difficult to control <TT>DELETE</TT> functionality with an access\r\ncontrol scheme based on methods.\r\n\r\n<P>While the <TT>POST</TT> method is sufficiently open-ended that a \"create a\r\ncollection\" <TT>POST</TT> command could be constructed, this is\r\nundesirable because it would be difficult to separate access\r\ncontrol for collection creation from other uses of <TT>POST</TT> if they\r\nboth use the same method.\r\n\r\n<P>While it might seem desirable to have <TT>GET</TT> return a listing of the\r\nmembers of a collection, this is foiled by the existence of the\r\n\"index.html\" de-facto standard namespace redirection, in which a\r\n<TT>GET</TT> request on a collection is automatically redirected to the\r\nindex.html resource.\r\n\r\n<P>The exact definition of the behavior of <TT>GET</TT> and <TT>PUT</TT> on\r\ncollections is defined later in this document.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>3.1.2.1   Example</H4>\r\n\r\nThe structured resource http://foo/bar is created with a <TT>PUT</TT>. Bar\r\nis a multipart/related file with two members http://foo/bar/a and\r\nhttp://foo/bar/b. If bar were deleted then both a and b would\r\nalso be deleted since they are all really just one resource. If\r\nhttp://foo/bar/a/c was <TT>PUT</TT> then a <TT>DELETE</TT> on http://foo/bar/a\r\nwould also delete http://foo/bar/a/c as c was created with a <TT>PUT</TT>\r\nnot a <TT>MKCOL</TT>.\r\n\r\n<P>If http://foo/bar/b/d is created with a <TT>MKCOL</TT> and\r\nhttp://foo/bar/b/d/e was created then a <TT>DELETE</TT> on d would fail\r\nbecause d is a collection with an internal member. However the\r\nexistence of the collection d is something of an illusion. If a\r\n<TT>DELETE</TT> was executed on http://foo/bar then everything would be\r\ndeleted, even though http://foo/bar/b/d was created with a <TT>MKCOL</TT>.\r\n\r\n<P>Thus the effect of a <TT>MKCOL</TT> within a composite resource's\r\nnamespace is felt on its children, not its ancestors. The\r\nchildren of d MUST be treated as members of a collection when a\r\nmethod is executed on d. But a method executed on b or a is\r\ntreated as if there only existed a non-collection resource.\r\n\r\n<h4>3.1.3     Source Resources and Output Resources</h4>\r\n\r\nFor many resources, the entity returned by <TT>GET</TT> exactly matches\r\nthe persistent state of the resource, for example, a GIF file\r\nstored on a disk.  For this simple case, the URL at which a\r\nresource is accessed is identical to the URL at which the source\r\n(the persistent state) of the resource is accessed. This is also\r\nthe case for HTML source files that are not processed by the\r\nserver prior to transmission.\r\n\r\n<P>However, the server can sometimes process HTML resources before\r\nthey are transmitted as a return entity body. For example,\r\nserver-side-include directives within an HTML file instruct a\r\nserver to replace the directive with another value, such as the\r\ncurrent date.  In this case, what is returned by <TT>GET</TT> (HTML plus\r\ndate) differs from the persistent state of the resource (HTML\r\nplus directive). Typically there is no way to access the HTML\r\nresource containing the unprocessed directive.\r\n\r\n<P>Sometimes the entity returned by <TT>GET</TT> is the output of a data-producing process that is described by one or more source\r\nresources (that may not even have a location in the URL\r\nnamespace).  A single data-producing process may dynamically\r\ngenerate the state of a potentially large number of output\r\nresources. An example of this is a CGI script that describes a\r\n\"finger\" gateway process that maps part of the namespace of a\r\nserver into finger requests, such as\r\nhttp://www.foo.bar.org/finger_gateway/user@host.\r\n\r\n<P>In the absence of distributed authoring capability, it is\r\nacceptable to have no mapping of source resource(s) to the URI\r\nnamespace, and in fact has desirable security benefits. However,\r\nif remote editing of the source resource(s) is desired, the\r\nsource resource(s) should be given a location in the URI\r\nnamespace. This source location should not be one of the\r\nlocations at which the generated output is retrievable, since in\r\ngeneral it is impossible for the server to differentiate requests\r\nfor source resources from requests for process output resources.\r\nThere is often a many-to-many relationship between source\r\nresources and output resources.\r\n\r\n<P>For DAV compliant servers all output resources which have a\r\nsingle source resource (and that source resource has a URI), the\r\nURI of the source resource SHOULD be stored in a single link on\r\nthe output resource with type\r\nhttp://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/source. Note that by storing\r\nthe source URI in links on the output resources, the burden of\r\ndiscovering the source is placed on the authoring client.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>3.2  <TT>MKCOL</TT> Method</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.2.1     Problem Description</h4>\r\n\r\nA client must be able to create a collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.2.2     Solution Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\nThe solution must ensure that a collection has been made (i.e.\r\nthat it responds to the <TT>INDEX</TT> method) as opposed to a non-collection resource. If a collection could not be made, it must\r\nindicate this failure to the user-agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.2.3     Request</h4>\r\n\r\n<TT>MKCOL</TT> creates a new collection resource at the location specified\r\nby the Request-URI. If the Request-URI exists, then <TT>MKCOL</TT> must\r\nfail. During <TT>MKCOL</TT> processing, a server MUST make the Request-URI\r\na member of its parent collection. If no such an ancestor exists,\r\nthe method MUST fail. When the <TT>MKCOL</TT> operation creates a new\r\ncollection resource, all ancestors MUST already exist, or the\r\nmethod MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.  For example,\r\nif a request to create collection <TT>/a/b/c/d/</TT> is made, and neither\r\n<TT>/a/b/</TT> nor <TT>/a/b/c/</TT> exist, the request MUST fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>3.2.3.1   MKCOL Without Request Body</H4>\r\n\r\nWhen <TT>MKCOL</TT> is invoked without a request body, the newly created\r\ncollection has no members.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>3.2.3.2   MKCOL With Request Body</H4>\r\n\r\nA <TT>MKCOL</TT> request message MAY contain a message body.  The behavior\r\nof a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request when the body is present is limited to\r\ncreating collections, members of a collection, bodies of members\r\nand properties on the collections or members. If the server\r\nreceives a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request entity type it does not support or\r\nunderstand it MUST respond with a 415 (Unsupported Media Type)\r\nstatus code.  The exact behavior of <TT>MKCOL</TT> for various request\r\nmedia types is undefined in this document, and will be specified\r\nin separate documents.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.2.4     Response</h4>\r\n\r\nResponses from a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request are not cacheable, since <TT>MKCOL</TT> has\r\nnon-idempotent semantics.\r\n<LI>201 (Created) - The collection or structured resource was created\r\nin its entirety.\r\n<LI>403 (Forbidden) - This indicates at least one of two conditions:\r\n1) The server does not allow the creation of collections at the\r\ngiven location in its namespace, and 2) The parent collection of\r\nthe Request-URI exists but cannot accept members.\r\n<LI>409 (Conflict) - A collection cannot be made at the Request-URI\r\nuntil one or more intermediate collections have been created.\r\n\r\n<LI> 415 (Unsupported Media Type)- The server does not support the\r\nrequest type of the body.\r\n<LI>417 (Insufficient Space on Resource) - The resource does not have\r\nsufficient space to record the state of the resource after the\r\nexecution of this method.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.2.5     Example</h4>\r\n\r\nThis example creates a container collection called\r\n/webdisc/xfiles/ on the server www.server.org.\r\n<PRE>\r\n     MKCOL /webdisc/xfiles/ HTTP/1.1\r\n     Host: www.server.org\r\n\r\n     HTTP/1.1 201 Created\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.3  Standard DAV Properties</h3>\r\n\r\nThe following properties are defined on DAV compliant resources.\r\nAll enclosed properties are part of the DAV Schema.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.3.1     <TT>IsCollection</TT> Property</h4>\r\n\r\nName:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/iscollection\r\n<BR>Purpose:  This property contains a Boolean value that is set to\r\n\"true\" if the resource is a collection\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Value:    (\"true\" | \"false\")\r\n<BR>Description: This property MUST be defined on all DAV compliant\r\nresources.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.3.2     <TT>DisplayName</TT> Property</h4>\r\n\r\nName: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/displayname\r\n<BR>Purpose:  A name for the resource that is suitable for\r\npresentation to a user.\r\n<BR>Schema:   http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Value:    Any valid XML character data (as defined in [Bray,\r\nSperberg-McQueen, 1997])\r\n<BR>Description: This property SHOULD be defined on all DAV compliant\r\nresources.

The result also contains the URI of\r\nthe IsCollection property on the member resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>3.5  Behavior of RFC 2068 Methods on Collections</h3>\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the collection resource type to the HTTP\r\nobject model, it is necessary to define the behavior of the\r\nexisting methods (defined in RFC 2068) when invoked on a\r\ncollection resource to avoid ambiguity.  While some methods, such\r\nas <TT>OPTIONS</TT> and <TT>TRACE</TT> behave identically when applied to\r\ncollections, <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT>, <TT>POST</TT>, <TT>PUT</TT>, and <TT>DELETE</TT> require some\r\nadditional explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.5.1     <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT> for Collections</h4>\r\n\r\nThe semantics of <TT>GET</TT> are unchanged when applied to a collection,\r\nsince <TT>GET</TT> is defined as, \"retrieve whatever information (in the\r\nform of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI\" [Fielding et\r\nal., 1997]. <TT>GET</TT> when applied to a collection MAY return the\r\ncontents of an \"index.html\" resource, a human-readable view of\r\nthe contents of the collection, or something else altogether, and\r\nhence it is possible the result of a <TT>GET</TT> on a collection will\r\nbear no correlation to the state of the collection.\r\n\r\n<P>Similarly, since the definition of <TT>HEAD</TT> is a <TT>GET</TT> without a\r\nresponse message body, the semantics of <TT>HEAD</TT> are unmodified when\r\napplied to collection resources.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.5.2     <tt>POST</tt> for Collections</h4>\r\n\r\nSince by definition the actual function performed by <TT>POST</TT> is\r\ndetermined by the server and often depends on the particular\r\nresource, the behavior of <TT>POST</TT> when applied to collections cannot\r\nbe meaningfully modified because it is largely undefined.  Thus\r\nthe semantics of <TT>POST</TT> are unmodified when applied to a\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.5.3     <TT>PUT</TT> for Collections</h4>\r\n\r\nAs defined in the HTTP/1.1 specification [Fielding et al., 1997],\r\nthe \"<TT>PUT</TT> method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under\r\nthe supplied Request-URI.\"  Since submission of an entity\r\nrepresenting a collection would implicitly encode creation and\r\ndeletion of resources, this specification intentionally does not\r\ndefine a transmission format for creating a collection using <TT>PUT</TT>.\r\nInstead, the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method is defined to create collections.  If a\r\n<TT>PUT</TT> is invoked on a collection resource it MUST fail.\r\n\r\n<P>When the <TT>PUT</TT> operation creates a new non-collection resource all\r\nancestors MUST already exist.  If all ancestors do not exist, the\r\nmethod MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.  For example,\r\nif resource /a/b/c/d.html is to be created and /a/b/c/ does not\r\nexist, then the request MUST fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>3.5.3.1   <TT>PUT</TT> for Non-Collection Resources</H4>\r\n\r\nA <TT>PUT</TT> performed on an existing resource replaces the <TT>GET</TT> response\r\nentity of the resource, but MUST NOT change the value of any dead\r\nproperties defined on the resource.  Live properties defined on\r\nthe resource MAY be recomputed during <TT>PUT</TT> processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.5.4     DELETE for Collections</h4>\r\n\r\nWhen <TT>DELETE</TT> is applied to a collection without internal members\r\nthe collection resource, along with its properties, and external\r\nmembers, MUST be deleted.  A <TT>DELETE</TT> method applied to a\r\ncollection resource containing internal member resources MUST\r\nfail with a 409 Conflict status code.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.5.5     DELETE Method for Non-Collection Resources</h4>\r\n\r\nIf the <TT>DELETE</TT> method is issued to a non-collection resource which\r\nis an internal member of a collection, then during <TT>DELETE</TT>\r\nprocessing a server MUST remove the Request-URI from its parent\r\ncollection. A server MAY remove the URI of a deleted resource\r\nfrom any collections of which the resource is an external member.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>3.6  COPY Method</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.6.1     Problem Description</h4>\r\n\r\nCurrently, in order to create a copy of a resource, the client\r\nmust <TT>GET</TT> an entity and then <TT>PUT</TT> that entity to the desired\r\ndestination. This requires (1) an entity to be transmitted to and\r\nfrom the server and (2) that the resource be expressible as an\r\nentity with complete fidelity.\r\n\r\n<P>This is problematic because of the network traffic involved in\r\nmaking a copy, and because there is often no way to fully express\r\na resource as an entity without a loss of fidelity.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.6.2     Solution Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\n<LI> MUST allow a principal to create a copy of a resource\r\n  without having to transmit the resource to and from the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.6.3     The Request</h4>\r\n\r\nThe <TT>COPY</TT> method creates a duplicate of the source resource, given\r\nby the Request-URI, in the destination resource, given by the\r\nDestination header.  The Destination header MUST be present.  The\r\nexact behavior of the <TT>COPY</TT> method depends on the type of the\r\nsource resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>3.6.3.1   COPY for HTTP/1.1 resources</H4>\r\n\r\nWhen the source resource is not a collection, and is not a\r\nproperty, the body of the destination resource MUST be octet-for-octet identical to the body of the source resource. Alterations\r\nto the destination resource do not modify the source resource.\r\nAlterations to the source resource do not modify the destination\r\nresource. Thus, all copies are performed \"by-value\".\r\n\r\n<P>All properties on the source resource MUST be duplicated on the\r\ndestination resource, subject to modifying headers, following the\r\ndefinition for copying properties.\r\n\r\n<H4>3.6.3.2   COPY for Properties</H4>\r\n\r\nThe following section defines how properties on a resource are\r\nhandled during a <TT>COPY</TT> operation.\r\nLive properties SHOULD be duplicated as identically behaving live\r\nproperties at the destination resource. Since they are live\r\nproperties, the server determines the syntax and semantics (hence\r\nvalue) of these properties.  Properties named by the Enforce-Live-Properties header MUST be live on the destination resource, or\r\nthe method MUST fail.  If a property is not named by Enforce-Live-Properties and cannot be copied live, then its value MUST be\r\nduplicated, octet-for-octet, in an identically named, dead\r\nresource on the destination resource.\r\n\r\n<P>If a property on the source already exists on the resource and\r\nthe overwrite header is set to TRUE then the property at the\r\ndestination MUST be overwritten with the property from the\r\nsource. If the overwrite header is false and the previous\r\nsituation exists then the <TT>COPY</TT> MUST fail with a 409 Conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>3.6.3.3   COPY for Collections</H4>\r\n\r\nA <TT>COPY</TT> on a collection causes a new, empty collection resource to\r\nbe created at the destination with the same properties as the\r\nsource resource.  All properties on the source collection MUST be\r\nduplicated on the destination collection, subject to modifying\r\nheaders, following the definition for copying properties.  The\r\nnew collection MUST NOT contain any members, internal or\r\nexternal.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>3.6.3.4   Type Interactions</H4>\r\n\r\nIf the destination resource identifies a property and the source\r\nresource is not a property, then the copy SHOULD fail.\r\n\r\n<P>If the destination resource identifies a collection and the\r\nOverwrite header is \"true,\" prior to performing the copy, the\r\nserver MUST perform a <TT>DELETE</TT> operation on the collection.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.6.4     The Response</h4>\r\n\r\n<LI>200 (OK) The source resource was successfully copied to a pre-existing destination resource.\r\n\r\n<LI>201 (Created) The source resource was successfully copied.  The\r\ncopy operation resulted in the creation of a new resource.\r\n\r\n<LI>412 (Precondition Failed) This status code MUST be returned if\r\nthe server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties\r\nlisted in the Enforce-Live-Properties header, or if the Overwrite\r\nheader is false, and the state of the destination resource is\r\nnon-null.\r\n\r\n<LI>417 (Insufficient Space on Resource) - The destination resource\r\ndoes not have sufficient space to record the state of the\r\nresource after the execution of this method.\r\n\r\n<LI>500 (Server Error) The resource was in such a state that it could\r\nnot be copied. This may occur if the Destination header specifies\r\na resource that is outside the namespace the resource is able to\r\ninteract with.\r\n\r\n<h4>3.6.5     Examples</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>3.6.5.1   Overwrite Example</H4>\r\n\r\nThis example shows resource\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being copied to the\r\nlocation http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html.  The\r\ncontents of the destination resource were overwritten, if non-null.\r\n\r\n<PRE>COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.ics.uci.edu\r\nDestination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<H4>3.6.5.2   No Overwrite Example</H4>\r\n\r\nThe following example shows the same copy operation being\r\nperformed, except with the Overwrite header set to \"false.\"  A\r\nresponse of 412, Precondition Failed, is returned because the\r\ndestination resource has a non-null state.\r\n\r\n<PRE>COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.ics.uci.edu\r\nDestination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html\r\nOverwrite: \"false\"\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<h3>3.7  MOVE Method</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>3.7.1     Problem Description</h4>\r\n\r\nThe move operation on a resource is the logical equivalent of a\r\ncopy followed by a delete, where the actions are performed\r\natomically.  Using RFC 2068 methods only, this procedure could be\r\nperformed in several steps. First, the client could issue a <TT>GET</TT>\r\nto retrieve a representation of a resource, issue a <TT>DELETE</TT> to\r\nremove the resource from the server, then use <TT>PUT</TT> to place the\r\nresource on the server with a new URI. As is the case for <TT>COPY</TT> -\r\nbecause of the network traffic involved in making a move, and\r\nbecause there is often no way to fully express a resource as an\r\nentity without a loss of fidelity - server move functionality is\r\npreferable.\r\n\r\n<P>With a WEBDAV server, a principal may accomplish this task by\r\nissuing a <TT>COPY</TT> and then <TT>DELETE</TT>. Network load decreases, but the\r\nserver load may still be significant because the server must\r\ncreate a duplicate resource. Were a server to know beforehand\r\nthat a principal intended to perform <TT>COPY</TT> and <TT>DELETE</TT> operations\r\nin succession, it could avoid the creation of a duplicate\r\nresource.\r\n\r\n<h4>3.7.2     Solution Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\n<LI> Must prevent the unneeded transfer of entity bodies from and\r\n  to the server.\r\n<LI> Must prevent the unneeded creation of copies by the server.\r\n\r\n<h4>3.7.3     The Request</h4>\r\n\r\nThe move operation on a resource is the logical equivalent of a\r\ncopy followed by a delete, where the actions are performed\r\natomically.

A successful response must\r\ncontain the Content-Location header, set equal to the URI in\r\nsource. This lets caches properly flush any cached entries for\r\nthe source.

This procedure is inefficient because the entire\r\nentity for a resource must be transmitted to and from the server\r\nin order to make even small changes.

If the value \"*\" is given for the\r\nheader, then it designates all live properties on the source\r\nresource.  If the value is \"Omit\" then the server MUST NOT\r\nduplicate on the destination resource any properties that are\r\ndefined on the source resource.

A value of \"false\" states that the server MUST NOT\r\nperform the <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT> operation if the state of the\r\ndestination resource is non-null. By default, the value of\r\nOverwrite is \"true,\" and a client MAY omit this header from a\r\nrequest when its value is \"true.\" While the Overwrite header\r\nappears to duplicate the functionality of the If-Match: * header\r\nof HTTP/1.1, If-Match applies only to the Request-URI, and not to\r\nthe Destination of a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT>.\r\n\r\n<PRE>     Overwrite = \"Overwrite\" \":\" (\"true\" | \"false\")\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nIf there is a conflict and the Overwrite header equals \"true\", or\r\nis absent and thus defaults to \"true\", then the method MUST fail\r\nwith a 409 Conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.11.4    Destroy Header</h4>\r\n\r\nWhen deleting a resource the client often wishes to specify\r\nexactly what sort of delete is being enacted.

The Destroy header is specified as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe Undelete token requests that, if possible, the resource\r\nshould be left in a state such that it can be undeleted. The\r\nserver is not required to honor this request.\r\n\r\n<P>The NoUndelete token requests that the resource MUST NOT be left\r\nin a state such that it can be undeleted.\r\n\r\n<P>The VersionDestroy token includes the functionality of the\r\nNoUndelete token and extends it to include having the server\r\nremove all versioning references to the resource that it has\r\ncontrol over.\r\n\r\n<PRE>     DestroyHeader = \"Destroy\" \":\" #Choices\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nChoices = \"VersionDestroy\" | \"NoUndelete\" | \"Undelete\" | token\r\n|\"&lt;\" URI \"&gt;\" ; a token extension MUST NOT be used unless it is\r\nspecified in a RFC16, otherwise a URI MUST be used for\r\nextensions.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.11.5    Collection-Member Header</h4>\r\n\r\nThe Collection-Member header specifies the URI of an external\r\nresource to be added/deleted to/from a collection.\r\n\r\n<PRE>     CollectionMember = \"Collection-Member\" \":\" URI\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>3.12 Links</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3.12.1    Source Link Property Type</h4>\r\n\r\nName:     http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/source\r\n<BR>Purpose:       The destination of the source link identifies the\r\nresource that contains the unprocessed source of the link's\r\nsource.\r\n<BR>Schema:        http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/link/\r\n<BR>Parent:        Any\r\n<BR>Value:         An XML document with zero or more link XML\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nDiscussion: The source of the link (src) is typically the URI of\r\nthe output resource on which the link is defined, and there is\r\ntypically only one destination (dst) of the link, which is the\r\nURI where the unprocessed source of the resource may be accessed.\r\nWhen more than one link destination exists, this specification\r\nasserts no policy on ordering.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>4    State Tokens</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>4.1  Overview</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>4.1.1     Problem Description</h4>\r\n\r\nThere are times when a principal will want to predicate\r\nsuccessful execution of a method on the current state of a\r\nresource.  While HTTP/1.1 provides a mechanism for conditional\r\nexecution of methods using entity tags via the \"If-Match\" and\r\n\"If-None-Match\" headers, the mechanism is not sufficiently \r\nextensibleto express conditional statements involving more \r\ngeneric state indicators, such as lock tokens.\r\n\r\n<P>The fundamental issue with entity tags is that they can only be\r\ngenerated by a resource. However there are times when a client\r\nwill want to be able to share state tokens between resources,\r\npotentially on different servers, as well as be able to generate\r\ncertain types of lock tokens without first having to communicate\r\nwith a server.\r\n\r\n<P>For example, a principal may wish to require that resource B have\r\na certain state in order for a method to successfully execute on\r\nresource A. If the client submits an e-tag from resource B to\r\nresource A, then A has no way of knowing that the e-tag is meant\r\nto describe resource B.\r\n\r\n<P>Another example occurs when a principal wishes to predicate the\r\nsuccessful completion of a method on the absence of any locks on\r\na resource. It is not sufficient to submit an \"If-None-Match: *\"\r\nas this refers to the existence of an entity, not of a lock.\r\n\r\n<P>This draft defines the term \"state token\" as an identifier for a\r\nstate of a resource. The sections below define requirements for\r\nstate tokens and provide a  state token syntax, along with two\r\nnew headers which can accept the new state token syntax.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>4.1.2     Solution Requirements</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>4.1.2.1   Syntax</H4>\r\n\r\nSelf-Describing. A state token must be self describing such that\r\nupon inspecting a state token it is possible to determine what\r\nsort of state token it is, what resource(s) it applies to, and\r\nwhat state it represents.\r\n\r\n<P>This self-describing nature allows servers to accept tokens from\r\nother servers and potentially be able to coordinate state\r\ninformation cross resource and cross site through standardized\r\nprotocols. For example, the execution of a request on resource A\r\ncan be predicated on the state of resource B, where A and B are\r\npotentially on different servers.\r\n\r\n<P>Client Generable. The state token syntax must allow, when\r\nappropriate, for clients to generate a state token without having\r\nfirst communicated with a server.\r\n\r\n<P>One drawback of entity tags is that they are set by the server,\r\nand there is no interoperable algorithm for calculating an entity\r\ntag. Consequently, a client cannot generate an entity tag from a\r\nparticular state of a resource.  However, a state token which\r\nencodes an MD5 state hash could be calculated by a client based\r\non a client-held state of a resource, and then submitted to a\r\nserver in a conditional method invocation.\r\n\r\n<P>Another potential use for client generable state tokens is for a\r\nclient to generate lock tokens with wild card fields, and hence\r\nbe able to express conditionals such as: \"only execute this <TT>GET</TT>\r\nif there are no write locks on this resource.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>4.1.2.2   Conditonals</H4>\r\n\r\nUniversal. A solution must be applicable to all requests.\r\nPositive and Negative. Conditional expressions must allow for the\r\nexpression of both positive and negative state requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>4.2  State Token Syntax</h3>\r\nState tokens are URLs employing the following syntax:\r\n<PRE>\r\nState-Token = \"StateToken:\" Type \":\" Resources \":\" State-Info\r\nType = \"Type\" \"=\" Caret-encoded-URL\r\nResources = \"Res\" \"=\" Caret-encoded-URL\r\nCaret-encoded-URL = \"^\" Resource \"^\"\r\nResource = &lt;A URI where all \"^\" characters are escaped&gt;\r\nState-Info = *(uchar | reserved)  ; uchar, reserved defined\r\nsection 3.2.1 of RFC 2068\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<p>This proposal has created a new URL scheme for state tokens\r\nbecause a state token names a network resource using its normal\r\nname, which is typically state-invariant, along with additional\r\ninformation that specifies a particular state of the resource.\r\nEncoding the state information into the native URL scheme of the\r\nnetwork resource was not felt to be safe, since freedom from name\r\nspace collisions could not be guaranteed. If this proposal is\r\naccepted, the StateToken URL scheme will need to be defined and\r\nregistered with IANA.\r\n\r\n<P>State Token URLs begin with the URL scheme name \"StateToken\"\r\nrather than the name of the particular state token type they\r\nrepresent in order to make the URL self describing. Thus it is\r\npossible to examine the URL and know, at a minimum, that it is a\r\nstate token.\r\n\r\n<P>Labeled name/value pairs are used within the token to allow new\r\nfields to be added. Processors of state tokens MUST be prepared\r\nto accept the fields in whatever order they are present and MUST\r\nignore any fields they do not understand.\r\nThe \"Type\" field specifies the type of the state information\r\nencoded in the state token.

The\r\npurpose of the tag is to return state tokens defined on a\r\nresource in a response. The contents of the state-token are not\r\nguaranteed to be exhaustive and are generally used to return a\r\nnew state token that has been defined as the result of a method.\r\nFor example, if a <TT>LOCK</TT> method were successfully executed on a\r\nresource the response would include a state token header with the\r\nlock state token included.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>4.5  E-Tags</h3>\r\n\r\nE-tags have already been deployed using the If-Match and If-None-Match headers.  Introducing two mechanisms to express e-tags\r\nwould only confuse matters, therefore e-tags should continue to\r\nbe expressed using quoted strings and the If-Match and If-None-Match headers.\r\n\r\n<h2>5    Locking</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.1  Locking: Introduction</h3>\r\n\r\nLocking is used to arbitrate access to a resource amongst\r\nprincipals that have equal access rights to that resource.\r\n\r\n<P>This specification allows locks to vary over two parameters, the\r\nnumber of principals involved and the type of access to be\r\ngranted. Furthermore, this document only provides the definition\r\nof locking for one access type, write. However, the syntax is\r\nextensible, and allows the specification of other access types.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.1.1     Exclusive Vs. Shared Locks</h4>\r\n\r\nThe most basic form of lock is an exclusive lock. This is a lock\r\nwhere the access right in question is only granted to a single\r\nprincipal. The need for this arbitration results from a desire to\r\navoid having to constantly merge results. In fact, many users so\r\ndislike having to merge that they would rather serialize their\r\naccess to a resource rather than have to constantly perform\r\nmerges.\r\n\r\n<P>However, there are times when the goal of a lock is not to\r\nexclude others from exercising an access right but rather to\r\nprovide a mechanism for principals to indicate that they intend\r\nto exercise their access right.  Shared locks are provided for\r\nthis case. A shared lock allows multiple principals to receive a\r\nlock, hence any principal with appropriate access can get the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\n<P>With shared locks there are two trust sets that affect a\r\nresource.  The first trust set is created by access permissions.\r\nPrincipals who are trusted, for example, may have permission to\r\nwrite the resource, those who are not, don't.  Among those who\r\nhave access permission to write the resource, the set of\r\nprincipals who have taken out a shared lock also must trust each\r\nother, creating a (typically) smaller trust set within the access\r\npermission write set.\r\n\r\n<P>Starting with every possible principal on the Internet, in most\r\nsituations the vast majority of these principals will not have\r\nwrite access to a given resource.  Of the small number who do\r\nhave write access, some principals may decide to guarantee their\r\nedits are free from overwrite conflicts by using exclusive write\r\nlocks. Others may decide they trust their collaborators (the\r\npotential set of collaborators being the set of principals who\r\nhave write permission) and use a shared lock, which informs their\r\ncollaborators that a principal is potentially working on the\r\nresource.\r\n\r\n<P>The WebDAV extensions to HTTP do not need to provide all of the\r\ncommunications paths necessary for principals to coordinate their\r\nactivities.  When using shared locks, principals may use any out\r\nof band communication channel to coordinate their work (e.g.,\r\nface-to-face interaction, written notes, post-it notes on the\r\nscreen, telephone conversation, email, etc.)  The intent of a\r\nshared lock is to let collaborators know who else is potentially\r\nworking on a resource.\r\n\r\n<P>Shared locks are included because experience from web distributed\r\nauthoring systems has indicated that exclusive write locks are\r\noften too rigid.  An exclusive write lock is used to enforce a\r\nparticular editing process: take out exclusive write lock, read\r\nthe resource, perform edits, write the resource, release the\r\nlock.  What happens if the lock isn't released?  While the time-out mechanism provides one solution, if you need to force the\r\nrelease of a lock immediately, it doesn't help much.  Granted, an\r\nadministrator can release the lock for you, but this could become\r\na significant burden for large sites. In addition there is the\r\nproblem that an administrator may not be immediately available.\r\n\r\n<P>Despite their potential problems, exclusive write locks are\r\nextremely useful, since often a guarantee of freedom from\r\noverwrite conflicts is what is needed.  The tradeoff described in\r\nthis specification is to provide exclusive write locks, but also\r\nto provide a less strict mechanism in the form of shared locks\r\nwhich can be used by a set of people who trust each other and who\r\nhave access to a communications channel external to HTTP which\r\ncan be used to negotiate writing to the resource.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.1.2     Required Support</h4>\r\n\r\nA WebDAV compliant server is not required to support locking in\r\nany form. If the server does support locking it may choose to\r\nsupport any combination of exclusive and shared locks for any\r\naccess types.\r\n\r\n<P>The reason for this flexibility is that server implementers have\r\nsaid that they are willing to accept minimum requirements on all\r\nservices but locking. Locking policy strikes to the very heart of\r\ntheir resource management and versioning systems and they require\r\ncontrol over what sort of locking will be made available. For\r\nexample, some systems only support shared write locks while\r\nothers only provide support for exclusive write locks while yet\r\nothers use no locking at all. As each system is sufficiently\r\ndifferent to merit exclusion of certain locking features, the\r\nauthors are proposing that locking be allowed as the sole axis of\r\nnegotiation within WebDAV.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>5.2  <TT>LOCK</TT> Method</h3>\r\n\r\nThe following sections describe the <TT>LOCK</TT> method, which is used to\r\ntake out a lock of any access type.  These sections on the <TT>LOCK</TT>\r\nmethod describe only those semantics that are specific to the\r\n<TT>LOCK</TT> method and are independent of the access type of the lock\r\nbeing requested.  Once the general <TT>LOCK</TT> method has been\r\ndescribed, subsequent sections describe the semantics of the\r\n\"write\" access type, and the write lock.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.1     Operation</h4>\r\nA <TT>LOCK</TT> method invocation creates the lock specified by the Lock-Info header on the Request-URI. Lock method requests SHOULD NOT\r\nhave a request body. A user-agent SHOULD submit an Owner header\r\nfield with a lock request.\r\n\r\n<P>A successful response to a lock invocation MUST include Lock-Token and Time-Out headers.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.2     The Effect of Locks on Properties and Containers</h4>\r\n\r\nBy default the scope of a lock is the entire state of the\r\nresource, including its body and associated properties. As a\r\nresult, a lock on a resource also locks the resource's\r\nproperties, and a lock on a property may lock a property's\r\nresource or may restrict the ability to lock the property's\r\nresource. Only a single lock token MUST be used when a lock\r\nextends to cover both a resource and its properties. Note that\r\ncertain lock types MAY override this behavior.\r\n\r\n<P>For containers, a lock also affects the ability to add or remove\r\nmembers. The nature of the effect depends upon the type of access\r\ncontrol involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.3     Locking Replicated Resources</h4>\r\n\r\nSome servers automatically replicate resources across multiple\r\nURLs. In such a circumstance the server MAY only accept a lock on\r\none of the URLs if the server can guarantee that the lock will be\r\nhonored across all the URLs.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.4     Locking Multiple Resources</h4>\r\n\r\nThe <TT>LOCK</TT> method supports locking multiple resources\r\nsimultaneously by allowing for the listing of several URIs in the\r\n<TT>LOCK</TT> request. These URIs, in addition to the Request-URI, are\r\nthen to be locked as a result of the <TT>LOCK</TT> method's invocation.\r\nWhen multiple resources are specified the <TT>LOCK</TT> method only\r\nsucceeds if all specified resources are successfully locked.\r\n\r\n<P>The Lock-Tree option of the lock request specifies that the\r\nresource and all its internal children (including internal\r\ncollections, and their internal members) are to be locked. This\r\nis another mechanism by which a request for a lock on multiple\r\nresources can be specified.\r\n\r\n<P>Currently existing locks can not be extended to cover more or\r\nless resources, and any request to expand or contract the number\r\nof resources in a lock MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.\r\nSo, for example, if resource A is exclusively write locked and\r\nthen the same principal asked to exclusively write lock resources\r\nA, B, and C, the request would fail as A is already locked and\r\nthe lock can not be extended.\r\n\r\n<P>A successful result will return a single lock token which\r\nrepresents all the resources that have been locked. If an <TT>UNLOCK</TT>\r\nis executed on this token, all associated resources are unlocked.\r\n\r\n<P>If the lock can not be granted to all resources, a 406 Conflict\r\nstatus code MUST be returned with a response entity body\r\ncontaining a <TT>multiresponse</TT> XML element describing which\r\nresource(s) prevented the lock from being granted.\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.5     Interaction with other Methods</h4>\r\n\r\nThe interaction of a <TT>LOCK</TT> with various methods is dependent upon\r\nthe lock type. However, independent of lock type, a successful\r\n<TT>DELETE</TT> of a resource MUST cause all of its locks to be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.6     Lock Compatibility Table</h4>\r\n\r\nThe table below describes the behavior that occurs when a lock\r\nrequest is made on a resource.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><th>Lock request<BR>Current lock state<Td>      Shared Lock<td>       Exclusive Lock</tr>\r\n<tr><TD>None<TD>                     True<TD>              True</TR>\r\n<TR><TD>Shared Lock<TD>              True<TD>              False</TR>\r\n<TR><TD>Exclusive Lock<TD>           False<TD>             False*</TR>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nLegend: True = lock MAY be granted.  False = lock MUST NOT be\r\ngranted.  *=if the principal requesting the lock is the owner of\r\nthe lock, the lock MAY be regranted.\r\n\r\n<P>The current lock state of a resource is given in the leftmost\r\ncolumn, and lock requests are listed in the first row.  The\r\nintersection of a row and column gives the result of a lock\r\nrequest.  For example, if a shared lock is held on a resource,\r\nand an exclusive lock is requested, the table entry is \"false\",\r\nindicating the lock must not be granted.\r\n\r\n<P>If an exclusive or shared lock is re-requested by the principal\r\nwho owns the lock, the lock MUST be regranted. If the lock is\r\nregranted, the same lock token that was previously issued MUST be\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.7     Status Codes</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<LI> 409 \"Conflict\" - The resource is locked, so the method has been\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n<LI> 412 \"Precondition Failed\" - The included state-token was not\r\nenforceable on this resource or the request in the lock-info\r\nheader could not be satisfied by the server.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.8     Lock-Info Request Header</h4>\r\n\r\nThe Lock-Info request header specifies the scope and type of a\r\nlock for a <TT>LOCK</TT> method request. The syntax specification below is\r\nextensible, allowing new type and scope identifiers to be added.\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nLockInfo = \"Lock-Info\" \":\" DAVLockType SP DAVLockScope [SP\r\nAdditionalLocks] [SP Lock-Tree]\r\nDAVLockType = \"LockType\" \"=\" DAVLockTypeValue\r\nDAVLockTypeValue = (\"Write\" | *(uchar | reserved))\r\nDAVLockScope = \"LockScope\" \"=\" DAVLockScopeValue\r\nDAVLockScopeValue = (\"Exclusive\" |\"Shared\" | *(uchar | reserved))\r\nAdditionalLocks = \"AddLocks\" \"=\" 1*(\"&lt;\" URI \"&gt;\")\r\nLock-Tree = \"Lock-Tree\" \"=\" (\"True\" | \"False\")\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nThe LockType field specifies the access type of the lock.  At\r\npresent, this specification only defines one lock type, the\r\n\"Write\" lock.  The LockScope field specifies whether the lock is\r\nan exclusive lock, or a shared lock.  The AddLocks field\r\nspecifies additional URIs, beyond the Request-URI, to which the\r\nlock request applies.  The LockTree field is used to specify\r\nrecursive locks.  If the LockTree field is \"true\", the lock\r\nrequest applies to the hierarchy traversal of the internal\r\nmembers resources of the Request-URI, and the AddLocks URIs,\r\ninclusive of the Request-URI and the AddLocks URIs. It is not an\r\nerror if LockTree is true, and the Request-URI or the AddLocks\r\nURIs have no internal member resources. By default, the value of\r\nLockTree is \"false\", and this field MAY be omitted when its value\r\nis false.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.9     Owner Request Header</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.2.9.1   Problem Description</H4>\r\n\r\nWhen discovering the list of owners of locks on a resource, a\r\nprincipal may want to be able to contact the owner directly. For\r\nthis to be possible the lock discovery mechanism must provide\r\nenough information for the lock owner to be contacted.\r\nAdditionally, programs may wish to be able to record structured\r\ninformation in the owner header so that other programs may be\r\nable to parse it later. Note, however, that these programs may\r\nnot necessarily be coordinating so there need be no guarantee\r\nthat the information can be parsed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.2.9.2   Solution Requirements</H4>\r\n\r\nNot all systems have authentication procedures that provide\r\nsufficient information to identify a particular user in a way\r\nthat is meaningful to a person. In addition, many systems that do\r\nhave sufficient information, such as a name and e-mail address,\r\ndo not have the ability to associate this information with the\r\nlock discovery mechanism. Therefore a means is needed to allow\r\nprincipals to provide authentication in a manner which will be\r\nmeaningful to a person.\r\n\r\n<P>The From header (defined in RFC 2068), which contains only an\r\nemail mailbox, is not sufficient for the purposes of quick\r\nidentification. When desperately looking for someone to remove a\r\nlock, e-mail is often not sufficient. A telephone number (cell\r\nnumber, pager number, etc.) would be better. Furthermore, the\r\nemail address in the From header only optionally includes the\r\nowners name and that name is often set to an alias anyway.\r\nTherefore a header more flexible than From is required.\r\n\r\n<P>The value also needs to be such that both man and machine can\r\nplace values in it and later retrieve those values.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.2.9.3   Syntax</H4>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nOwner = \"Owner\" \":\" (Coded-XML  | quoted-string)\r\nCoded-XML = field-content    ; XML where any character which is\r\n  not legal in field-content (see section 4.2 of [Fielding et al.,\r\n  1997]) is XML encoded\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nThe XML SHOULD provide information sufficient for either directly\r\ncontacting the principal (such as a telephone number or e-mail\r\nURI), or for discovering the principal (such as the URL of a\r\nhomepage) who owns the lock. The quoted string SHOULD provide a\r\nmeans for directly contacting the principal who owns the lock,\r\nsuch as a name and telephone number.\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.10    Time-Out Header</h4>\r\n\r\n<H4>5.2.10.1  Problem Description</H4>\r\n\r\nIn a perfect world principals take out locks, work on the\r\nresource, and then remove the lock when it is no longer needed.\r\nHowever, this process is frequently not completed, leaving active\r\nbut unused locks. Reasons for this include client programs\r\ncrashing and losing information about locks, users leaving their\r\nsystems for the day and forgetting to remove their locks, etc. As\r\na result of this behavior, servers need to establish a policy by\r\nwhich they can remove a lock without input from the lock owner.\r\nOnce such a policy is instituted, the server also needs a\r\nmechanism to inform the principal of the policy.\r\n\r\n<H4>5.2.10.2  Solution Requirements</H4>\r\n\r\nThere are two basic lock removal policies: administrator and time\r\nbased removal. In the case of administrator based removal, a\r\nprincipal other than the lock owner has sufficient access rights\r\nto order the lock removed, even though they did not take it out.\r\nThe second policy type is time based removal.  In this case, a\r\ntimer is set as soon as the lock is created. Every time a method\r\nis executed on any resource covered by the lock, the timer is\r\nreset. If the timer runs out, the lock is removed.\r\n\r\n<P>User-agents MUST assume that locks may arbitrarily disappear at\r\nany time. If their actions require confirmation of the existence\r\nof a lock then the If-State headers are available.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.2.10.3  Syntax</H4>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nTimeOut = \"Time-Out\" \":\" 1#TimeType\r\nTimeType = (\"Second-\" DAVTimeOutVal | \"Infinite\" | Extend)\r\nDAVTimeOutVal = 1*digit\r\nExtend = RFC-Reg | URL \"-\" Token ; The URL format is used for\r\nunregistered TimeTypes\r\nRFC-Req = Token ; This is a TimeType that has been published as an RFC\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n\r\nClients MAY include TimeOut headers in their <TT>LOCK</TT> requests.\r\nHowever the server is not required to honor or even consider the\r\nrequest. Clients MUST NOT submit a Time-Out request header with\r\nany method other than a <TT>LOCK</TT> method.\r\n\r\n<P>A Time-Out request header MUST contain at least one TimeType and\r\nMAY contain multiple TimeType entries. The purpose of listing\r\nmultiple TimeType is to indicate multiple different values and\r\nvalue types that are acceptable to the client. The client lists\r\nthe TimeType entries in order of preference.\r\n\r\n<P>The Time-Out response header MUST use a Second value, Infinite,\r\nor a TimeType the client has indicated familiarity with. The\r\nserver MAY assume a client is familiar with any TimeType\r\nsubmitted in a Time-Out header.\r\n\r\n<P>The \"Second\" TimeType specifies the number of seconds that MUST\r\nelapse between granting of the lock at the server, and the\r\nautomatic removal of the lock. A server MUST not generate a time\r\nout value for \"Second\" greater than 2^32-1.\r\n\r\n<P>The time out counter is restarted any time the client sends a\r\nmethod to any member of the lock, including unsupported methods,\r\nor methods which are unsuccessful. It is recommended that the\r\n<TT>HEAD</TT> method be used when the goal is simply to restart the time\r\nout counter.\r\n\r\n<P>If the timeout expires then the lock is lost. Specifically the\r\nserver SHOULD act as if an <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method was executed by the\r\nserver on the resource using the lock token of the timed-out\r\nlock, performed with its override authority. Thus logs,\r\nnotifications, and other mechanisms that act as side effects to\r\nthe granting and removal of a lock will be properly informed as\r\nto the disposition of the lock.\r\n\r\n<P>Servers are advised to pay close attention to the values\r\nsubmitted by clients, as they will be indicative of the type of\r\nactivity the client intends to perform. For example, an applet\r\nrunning in a browser may need to lock a resource, but because of\r\nthe instability of the environment within which the applet is\r\nrunning, the applet may be turned off without warning. As a\r\nresult, the applet is likely to ask for a relatively small time-out value so that if the applet dies, the lock can be quickly\r\nharvested. However a document management system is likely to ask\r\nfor an extremely long time-out because its user may be planning\r\non going off-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.11    Lock Response</h4>\r\n\r\nA successful lock response MUST contain a Lock-Token response\r\nheader, a Time-Out header and a <TT>Prop</TT> element in the response body\r\nwhich contains the value of the LockDiscovery property.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.2.11.1  Lock-Token Response Header</H4>\r\n\r\nIf a resource is successfully locked then a lock-token header\r\nwill be returned containing the lock token that represents the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nLock-Token = \"Lock-Token\" \":\" URI\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.12    Example - Simple Lock Request</h4>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nLOCK /workspace/webdav/proposal.doc HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: webdav.sb.aol.com\r\nLock-Info: LockType=Write LockScope=Exclusive\r\nTime-Out: Infinite; Second-4100000000\r\nOwner: &lt;?XML:Namespace href=\"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" AS =\r\n\"D\"/&gt;\r\n &lt;D:HREF&gt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/contact.html&lt;/D:HREF&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nLock-Token: OpaqueLockToken:xyz122393481230912asdfa09s8df09s7df08\r\nsd0f98a098sda\r\nTime-Out: Second-604800\r\nContent-Type: text/xml\r\nContent-Length: xxxxx\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\n&lt;?XML:Namespace href =\"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" AS = \"D\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;D:Prop&gt;\r\n     &lt;lockdiscovery&gt;\r\n          &lt;activelock&gt;\r\n               &lt;locktype&gt;write&lt;/locktype&gt;\r\n               &lt;lockscope&gt;exclusive&lt;/lockscope&gt;\r\n               &lt;addlocks/&gt;\r\n               &lt;owner&gt;\r\n     &lt;HREF&gt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/contact.html&lt;/HREF&gt;\r\n               &lt;/owner&gt;\r\n               &lt;timeout&gt;Second-604800&lt;/timeout&gt;\r\n               &lt;locktoken&gt;\r\n                    &lt;HREF&gt;\r\n               OpaqueLockToken:xyz122393481230912asdfa09s8df09s7d\r\n               f08sd0f98a098sda\r\n                    &lt;/HREF&gt;\r\n               &lt;/locktoken&gt;\r\n          &lt;/activelock&gt;\r\n     &lt;/lockdiscovery&gt;\r\n&lt;/D:Prop&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nThis example shows the successful creation of an exclusive write\r\nlock on resource\r\nhttp://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/proposal.doc.

The response has a Lock-Token header that gives the\r\nstate token URL for the lock token generated by this lock\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.2.13    Example - Multi-Resource Lock Request</h4>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nLOCK /workspace/webdav/proposal.doc HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: webdav.sb.aol.com\r\nLock-Info: LockType=Write LockScope=Exclusive\r\nAddlocks=&lt;http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/&gt;&lt;http://foo.bar/blah&gt;\r\nTime-Out: Infinite, Second-4100000000\r\nOwner: &lt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/contact.html&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nHTTP/1.1 409 Conflict\r\nContent-Type: text/xml\r\nContent-Length: xxxxx\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\n&lt;?XML:Namespace href =\r\n     \"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" As = \"D\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;D:MultiResponse&gt;\r\n     &lt;Response&gt;\r\n          &lt;HREF&gt;\r\n          http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/proposal.doc\r\n          &lt;/HREF&gt;\r\n          &lt;HREF&gt;\r\n          http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/\r\n          &lt;/HREF&gt;\r\n          &lt;Status&gt;HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted&lt;/Status&gt;\r\n     &lt;/Response&gt;\r\n     &lt;Response&gt;\r\n          &lt;HREF&gt;http://foo.bar/blah&lt;/HREF&gt;\r\n          &lt;Status&gt;HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden&lt;/Status&gt;\r\n     &lt;/Response&gt;\r\n&lt;/D:MultiResponse&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nThis example shows a request for an exclusive write lock on three\r\nresources,\r\nhttp://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/proposal.doc,\r\nhttp://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/, and http://foo.bar/blah.  In\r\nthis request, the client has specified that it desires an\r\ninfinite length lock, if available, otherwise a timeout of 4.1\r\nbillion seconds, if available.  The Owner header field specifies\r\nthe web address for contact information for the principal taking\r\nout the lock.\r\n\r\n<P>This lock request has failed, because the server rejected the\r\nlock request for http://foo.bar/blah.  The 409 Conflict status\r\ncode indicates that the server was unable to satisfy the request\r\nbecause there is a conflict between the state of the resources\r\nand the operation named in the request.  Within the\r\n<TT>multiresponse</TT>, the 202 Accepted status code indicates that the\r\nlock method was accepted by the resources, and would have been\r\ncompleted if all resources named in the request were able to be\r\nlocked.  The 403 Forbidden status code indicates that the server\r\ndoes not allow lock requests on this resource.\r\n\r\n<h3>5.3  Write Lock</h3>\r\n\r\nThis section describes the semantics specific to the write access\r\ntype for locks.  The write lock is a specific instance of a lock\r\ntype, and is the only lock type described in this specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.3.1     Methods Restricted by Write Locks</h4>\r\n\r\nA write lock prevents a principal without the lock from\r\nsuccessfully executing a <TT>PUT</TT>, <TT>POST</TT>, <TT>PATCH</TT>, <TT>PROPPATCH</TT>, <TT>MOVE</TT>,\r\n<TT>DELETE</TT>, <TT>MKCOL</TT>, <TT>ADDREF</TT> or <TT>DELREF</TT> on the locked resource. All other\r\ncurrent methods, <TT>GET</TT> in particular, function independent of the\r\nlock.\r\n\r\n<P>Note, however, that as new methods are created it will be\r\nnecessary to specify how they interact with a write lock.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.3.2     Write Locks and Properties</h4>\r\n\r\nWhile those without a write lock may not alter a property on a\r\nresource it is still possible for the values of live properties\r\nto change, even while locked, due to the requirements of their\r\nschemas. Only dead properties and live properties defined to\r\nrespect locks are guaranteed to not change while write locked.\r\n\r\n<P>If a property is write locked then a <TT>LOCK</TT> request on the\r\nassociated resource MUST fail with a 409 \"Conflict\". Note that a\r\nwrite lock on a property MAY be extended to include the\r\nassociated resource without the principal having explicitly\r\nrequested the extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.3.3     Write Locks and Null Resources</h4>\r\n\r\nIt is possible to assert a write lock on a null resource in order\r\nto lock the name. Please note, however, that locking a null\r\nresource effectively makes the resource non-null as the resource\r\nnow has lock related properties defined on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.3.4     Write Locks and Collections</h4>\r\nA write lock on a collection prevents the addition or removal of\r\nmembers of the collection. As a consequence, when a principal\r\nissues a request to create a new internal member of a collection\r\nusing <TT>PUT</TT> or <TT>POST</TT>, or to remove an existing internal member of a\r\ncollection using <TT>DELETE</TT>, this request MUST fail if the principal\r\ndoes not have a write lock on the collection.\r\n\r\n<P>However, if a write lock request is issued to a collection\r\ncontaining internal member resources that are currently locked,\r\nthe request MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.3.5     Write Locks and <TT>COPY/MOVE</TT></h4>\r\n\r\nThe owner of a write lock MUST NOT execute a <TT>MOVE</TT> method on a\r\nresource they have locked. This specification intentionally does\r\nnot define what happens if a <TT>MOVE</TT> method request is made on a\r\nlocked resource by the lock's owner.\r\n\r\n<P>A <TT>COPY</TT> method invocation MUST NOT duplicate any write locks\r\nactive on the source.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.3.6     Re-issuing Write Locks</h4>\r\n\r\nIf a principal already owns a write lock on a resource, any\r\nfuture requests for the same type of write lock, on the same\r\nresource, while the principal's previous write lock is in effect,\r\nMUST result in a successful response with the same lock token as\r\nprovided for the currently existing lock. Two lock requests are\r\ndefined to be identical if their Lock-Info headers are identical.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.3.7     Write Locks and The State-Token Header</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.3.7.1   Problem Definition</H4>\r\n\r\nIf a user agent is not required to have knowledge about a lock\r\nwhen requesting an operation on a locked resource, the following\r\nscenario might occur. Program A, run by User A, takes out a write\r\nlock on a resource. Program B, also run by User A, has no\r\nknowledge of the lock taken out by Program A, yet performs a <TT>PUT</TT>\r\nto the locked resource. In this scenario, the <TT>PUT</TT> succeeds\r\nbecause locks are associated with a principal, not a program, and\r\nthus program B, because it is acting with principal A's\r\ncredential, is allowed to perform the <TT>PUT</TT>. However, had program B\r\nknown about the lock, it would not have overwritten the resource,\r\npreferring instead to present a dialog box describing the\r\nconflict to the user. Due to this scenario, a mechanism is needed\r\nto prevent different programs from accidentally ignoring locks\r\ntaken out by other programs with the same authorization.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.3.7.2   Solution Requirement</H4>\r\n\r\nThe solution must not require principals to perform discovery in\r\norder to prevent accidental overwrites as this could cause race\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n<P>The solution must not require that clients guess what sorts of\r\nlocks might be used and use if-state-match headers with wildcards\r\nto prevent collisions. The problem with trying to \"guess\" which\r\nlocks are being used is that new lock types might be introduced,\r\nand the program would not know to \"guess them\". So, for example,\r\na client might put in an if-state-match header with a wildcard\r\nspecifying that if any write lock is outstanding then the\r\noperation should fail. However a new read/write lock could be\r\nintroduced which the client would not know to put in the header.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.3.7.3   State-Token Header</H4>\r\n\r\nThe State-Token header, containing a lock token owned by the\r\nrequesting principal, is used by the principal to indicate that\r\nthe principal is aware of the existence of the lock specified by\r\nthe lock token. It is used in the following way.\r\n\r\n<P>If the following conditions are met:\r\n     1.   a user-agent has authenticated itself as a principal,\r\n     2.   the user-agent is submitting a method request to a\r\nresource\r\n          on which the principal owns a write lock,\r\n     3.   the method is restricted by a write lock, as defined in\r\nthe\r\n          section \"Methods Restricted by a Write Lock\",\r\nthen the method request MUST include a State-Token header with\r\nthe  lock token of the write lock, or the method fails with a 409\r\nConflict status code. If multiple resources are involved with a\r\nmethod, such as a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT> method, then the lock tokens, if\r\nany, for all involved resources, MUST be included in the State-Token request header.\r\n\r\n<P>For example, Program A, used by user A, takes out a write lock on\r\na resource. Program A then makes a number of <TT>PUT</TT> requests on the\r\nlocked resource, all the requests contain a State-Token header\r\nwhich includes the write lock state token. Program B, also run by\r\nUser A, then proceeds to perform a <TT>PUT</TT> to the locked resource.\r\nHowever program B was not aware of the existence of the lock and\r\nso does not include the appropriate state-token header. The\r\nmethod is rejected even though principal A is authorized to\r\nperform the <TT>PUT</TT>. Program B can, if it so chooses, now perform\r\nlock discovery and obtain the lock token. Note that program A and\r\nB can perform GETs without using the state-token header because\r\nthe ability to perform a <TT>GET</TT> is not affected by a write lock.\r\n\r\n<P>Having a lock state token provides no special access rights.\r\nAnyone can find out anyone else's lock state token by performing\r\nlock discovery. Locks are to be enforced based upon whatever\r\nauthentication mechanism is used by the server, not based on the\r\nsecrecy of the token values.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H4>5.3.7.3.1 Example</H4>\r\n\r\n<PRE>COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.ics.uci.edu\r\nDestination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html\r\nState-Token: &lt;OpaqueLockToken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2&gt;\r\n&lt;OpaqueLockToken:AAAASDFcalkjfdas12312&gt;\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nIn this example, both the source and destination are locked so\r\ntwo lock tokens must be submitted. If only one of the two\r\nresources was locked, then only one token would have to be\r\nsubmitted.\r\n\r\n<h3>5.4  Lock Tokens</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>5.4.1     Problem Description</h4>\r\n\r\nIt is possible that once a lock has been granted it may be\r\nremoved without the lock owner's knowledge. This can cause\r\nserialization problems if the lock owner executes methods\r\nthinking their lock is still active. Due to this, a mechanism is\r\nneeded for a principal to predicate the successful execution of a\r\nmessage upon the continuing existence of a lock.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.4.2     Lock Token Introduction</h4>\r\n\r\nA lock token is a type of state token that describes a particular\r\nlock.  A lock token is returned by every successful <TT>LOCK</TT>\r\noperation, and can also be discovered through lock discovery on a\r\nresource.\r\n\r\n<P>There are two types of lock tokens, a generic lock token, which\r\nis unique only for a particular resource, and an opaque lock\r\ntoken, which is unique across all resources for all time.\r\n\r\n<P>Uniqueness for a particular resource prevents problems with long\r\nheld outstanding lock tokens being confused with newer tokens.\r\nThis uniqueness requirement is the same as for e-tags. Uniqueness\r\nacross all resources for all time allows for tokens to be\r\nsubmitted across resources and servers without fear of confusion.\r\n\r\n<P>Generic lock tokens, because of their relaxed uniqueness\r\nrequirements, are faster to generate than opaque lock tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.4.3     Generic Lock Tokens</h4>\r\n\r\nAny valid URI can be used by the resource as a generic lock\r\ntoken. The only requirement is that the lock token MUST never\r\nhave been issued previously on that resource. Because a lock\r\ntoken is only guaranteed to be unique on the resource that\r\ngenerated it, the lock token MUST NOT be submitted in a state-token request header or an if-state[-not]-match header on any\r\nresource but the resource that generated it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.4.4     OpaqueLockToken Lock Token</h4>\r\n\r\nThe opaquelocktoken scheme is designed to be unique across all\r\nresources for all time. Due to this uniqueness quality, a client\r\nMAY submit an opaque lock token in a state-token request header\r\nand an if-state[-not]-match header on a resource other than the\r\none that returned it.\r\n\r\n<P>All resources MUST recognize the opaquelocktoken scheme and be\r\nable to, at minimum, recognize that the lock token was not\r\ngenerated by the resource. Note, however, that resources are not\r\nrequired to generate opaquelocktokens.\r\n\r\n<P>In order to guarantee uniqueness across all resources for all\r\ntime the opaquelocktoken requires the use of the GUID mechanism.\r\n\r\n<P>Opaquelocktoken generators however have a choice of how they\r\ncreate these tokens. They can either generate a new GUID for\r\nevery lock token they create, which is potentially very\r\nexpensive, or they can create a single GUID and then add\r\nextension characters. If the second method is selected then the\r\nprogram generating the extensions MUST guarantee that the same\r\nextension will never be used twice with the associated GUID.\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nOpaque-Lock-Token = \"OpaqueLockToken\" \":\" GUID [Extension]\r\nGUID = ; As defined in [LEACH]\r\nExtension = *urlc   ;urlc is defined in [Berners-Lee et al.,\r\n1997] (draft-fielding-url-syntax-07.txt)\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<h3>5.5  <TT>UNLOCK</TT> Method</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>5.5.1     Problem Definition</h4>\r\n\r\nThe <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method removes the lock identified by the lock token\r\nin the State-Token header from the Request-URI, and all other\r\nresources included in the lock.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>5.5.2     Example</h4>\r\n\r\n<PRE><TT>UNLOCK</TT> /workspace/webdav/info.doc HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: webdav.sb.aol.com\r\nState-Token: OpaqueLockToken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\nIn this example, the lock identified by the lock token\r\n\"OpaqueLockToken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2\" is successfully removed from\r\nthe resource http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/info.doc.\r\nIf this lock included more than just one resource, the lock is\r\nremoved from those resources as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>5.6  Discovery Mechanisms</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>5.6.1     Lock Capability Discovery</h4>\r\n\r\n<H4>5.6.1.1   Problem Definition</H4>\r\n\r\nSince server lock support is optional, a client trying to lock a\r\nresource on a server can either try the lock and hope for the\r\nbest, or perform some form of discovery to determine what lock\r\ncapabilities the server supports.  This is known as lock\r\ncapability discovery. Lock capability discovery differs from\r\ndiscovery of supported access control types, since there may be\r\naccess control types without corresponding lock types.\r\n\r\n<H4>5.6.1.2   SupportedLock Property</H4>\r\n\r\nName: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/lock/supportedlock\r\n<BR>Purpose: To provide a listing of the lock capabilities supported\r\nby the resource.\r\n<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Values: An XML document containing zero or more LockEntry XML\r\nelements.\r\n<BR>Description: The SupportedLock property of a resource returns a\r\nlisting of the combinations of scope and access types which may\r\nbe specified in a lock request on the resource. Note that the\r\nactual contents are themselves controlled by access controls so a\r\nserver is not required to provide information the client is not\r\nauthorized to see. If SupportedLock is available on \"*\" then it\r\nMUST define the set of locks allowed on all resources on that\r\nserver.\r\n\r\n<H4>5.6.1.3   LOCKENTRY XML Element</H4>\r\n\r\nName: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/lockentry\r\n<BR>Purpose: Defines a DAVLockType/LockScope pair which may be\r\nlegally used with a <TT>LOCK</TT> on the specified resource.\r\n<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent: A SupportedLock entry\r\n<BR>Values: LockType LockScope\r\n\r\n<H4>5.6.1.4   LOCKTYPE XML Element</H4>\r\n\r\nName: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/locktype\r\n<BR>Purpose: Lists a DAVLockType\r\n<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent: LOCKENTRY\r\n<BR>Values: DAVLockTypeValue\r\n\r\n<H4>5.6.1.5   LOCKSCOPE XML Element</H4>\r\n\r\nName: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/lockscope\r\n<BR>Purpose: Lists a DAVLockScope\r\n<BR>Schema: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\r\n<BR>Parent: LOCKENTRY\r\n<BR>Values: DAVLockScopeValue\r\n\r\n<H4>5.6.1.6   Example</H4>\r\n\r\n<PRE>PROPFIND  /container/ HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.foo.bar\r\nContent-Length: xxxx\r\nContent-Type: text/xml\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<PRE>&lt;?XML:Namespace href =\r\n     \"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" AS = \"D\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;D:PROPFIND&gt;\r\n     &lt;prop&gt;&lt;SupportedLock/&gt;&lt;/prop&gt;\r\n&lt;/D:PROPFIND&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<PRE>\r\nHTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Response\r\nContent-Type: text/xml\r\nContent-Length: xxxxx\r\n\r\n&lt;?XML:Namespace href =\"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" AS = \"D\"/&gt;\r\n&lt;D:MultiResponse&gt;\r\n     &lt;Response&gt;\r\n          &lt;Prop&gt;\r\n               &lt;SupportedLock&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LockEntry&gt;\r\n                         &lt;LockType&gt;Write&lt;/LockType&gt;\r\n                         &lt;LockScope&gt;Exclusive&lt;/LockScope&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/LockEntry&gt;\r\n                    &lt;LockEntry&gt;\r\n                         &lt;LockType&gt;Write&lt;/LockType&gt;\r\n                         &lt;LockScope&gt;Shared&lt;/LockScope&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/LockEntry&gt;\r\n               &lt;/SupportedLock&gt;\r\n          &lt;/Prop&gt;\r\n          &lt;Status&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 Success&lt;/Status&gt;\r\n&lt;/Response&gt;\r\n&lt;/D:MultiResponse&gt;\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<h4>5.6.2     Active Lock Discovery</h4>\r\n\r\n<H4>5.6.2.1   Problem Definition</H4>\r\n\r\nIf another principal locks a resource that a principal wishes to\r\naccess, it is useful for the second principal to be able to find\r\nout who the first principal is.\r\n\r\n<H4>5.6.2.2   Solution Requirements</H4>\r\n\r\nThe lock discovery mechanism should provide a list of who has the\r\nresource locked, what locks they have, and what their lock tokens\r\nare. The lock tokens are useful in shared lock situations where\r\ntwo principals may want to guarantee that they do not overwrite\r\neach other.
