Our drawings are planar, but they allow for multiple copies of\nvertices and edges on P's boundary, which is a common way of visualizing higher-genus graphs in the plane.\nAs a side note, we show that it is NP-complete to determine whether a given graph embedded in a genus-g\nsurface has a set of 2g fundamental cycles with vertex-disjoint interiors, which would be desirable from a\ngraph-drawing perspective. \n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
