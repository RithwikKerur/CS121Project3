How does this generalise to higher dimensions?\n\nInteresting. I can think of several layers of generalization, all of\nwhich I will answer in the charming language of \"genericness\" which\nlets one avoid ever actually proving anything (and which, therefore,\nmay be wrong!). There are some meaty computational questions raised at\nthe end to which I hope to return in a later post.\n\nLet's see, a generic line in  R^3  is characterized by the\npoint  p  where it crosses the  xy-plane and the unit vector  v  in it pointing\nup (towards positive  z), giving  4  degrees of freedom. Each line determines\na unique linear function  f: R -&gt; R^3  which parameterizes the line:\nf(t) = p + t v. Two such lines intersect if there exist values  t  and  t'\nwith  f(t)=f'(t'), which sets  3  linear equations on the  2  unknowns  and\nso in general has a unique solution iff some single equation in\na, p, a', and p'  is met. If  a'  and  p'  are given, this requires that\n(a, p)  lie in an algebraic set of codimension 1 in the family of all possible\n(a, p) 's. Since this family has dimension  4, as noted above, we should \nexpect to be able to do this four times before we're down to a discrete set:\ngenerically, any set of four lines has common intersection with only\nfinitely many different other lines. The original question claims this\nfinite number is  2.\n\nIn  R^n  we likewise see that the collection of lines has dimension  2n-2;\nthe condition that a line meets some other fixed line imposes  n  equations\non the set of variables made of all these parameters and two more (the \nt  and  t')  and so imposes  n-2  equations on the set of  (2n-2)  variables.\nFor large  n  we see this is generically impossible to arrange as soon as\n3  such intersections are required, although we would expect finitely many\nlines to intersect any three lines in  R^4  in general position. It is\nnot clear from this analysis what that finite number is. \n\nIn dimensions higher than four, you can only expect to start with 2\nlines, but clearly given any two lines, the possible other lines which\nmeet both of these are parameterized by the positions on the  two fixed\nlines where the intersections are to occur, so that the collection of\nall of them is precisely the 2-dimensional affine space, which is\nconsistent with the above dimension counts.\n\nWe could generalize a little differently by allowing the subspaces to \nhave a dimension  k  different from  1. The collection of  k-dimensional\nsubspaces of  R^n  has dimension  N=(k+1)(n-k). Fix two of them by\nspecifying the  N  parameters for each. A point on each subspace is\ndetermined by specifying  k  coordinates, so the condition that the\nsubspaces meet is expressed with  n  equations in  2k  unknowns, which\nwill not all be satisfied in general; indeed, we expect this to force\nn-2k  equations on the  2N  parameters. So if we view just one of the\ntwo subspaces as really fixed and the other as variable, then the\ncondition that the two meet forces  n-2k  equations to be satisfied\nby the  N  varying parameters. We expect to be able to do this  m\ntimes as long as  m(n-2k) <U>&lt;</U> N; if equality holds, we expect only a\nfinite number of possibilities.\n\nSo it looks to me that given any generic set of  m  subspaces of dimension  k\nin  R^n, you can find another such subspace which intersects all  m  of\nthem iff  m <U>&lt;</U> (k+1)(n-k)/(n-2k). The earlier paragraphs considered the\ncase  k=1. (The case  k=0  is trivial: two points don't intersect unless \nequal.) For any  k, it's clear that you can usually only find an\nintersecting subspace if the number of starting subspaces is at most  k+1\n(any two lines can be joined, any three planes, etc.); but for each  k\nyou can possibly join more subspaces if the ambient dimension  n  is small\n(you can join an extra subspace as long as  n <U>&lt;</U> k(k+3). The number of\nextra subspaces you can join goes up as  n  goes down, until you reach\nn=2k; for dimensions that low or lower you can join any number of subspaces\nof dimension  k; for example, you can find a line passing through any\ncountable collection of planes in R^3).\n\nFinally, one could generalize by allowing the subspaces to have different\ndimensions. This looks like a combinatorial nightmare, but one case is\nperhaps worthwhile: to let all the fixed subspaces have the same dimension\nk1  and to let the intersecting ones have a different dimension  k2.\nFor example, this includes the question of the number of subspaces of\ndimension  k2  pass through any  k2  distinct points (k1=0); of course\nthe answer there is one. It's easy enough to incorporate this variation in\nthe preceding analysis.\n\nThe more challenging question is to determine the number of possible\nintersecting subspaces when that number is finite (but nonzero). That is,\nfor any  k  and any factorization  k(k+1) = d1 d2, we look for the generic\nnumber of subspaces of dimension  k  which meet each of  k+1+d1  other\nsubspaces of dimension  k  inside  R^(2k+d2).\n\nk=1: How many lines pass through a generic set of  4  lines in  R^3? (Two?)\n     How many lines pass through a generic set of  3  lines in  R^4?\n\nk=2: How many planes pass through a generic set of  9  planes in  R^5?\n     How many planes pass through a generic set of  6  planes in  R^6?\n     How many planes pass through a generic set of  5  planes in  R^7?\n     How many planes pass through a generic set of  4  planes in  R^10?\n\nand so on. It is probably possible to answer any one of these with sufficient\ncalculations in algebraic geometry (I'll give it a go) but I don't\nsee right off the bat how to tackle all of them at once.\n\ndave\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Mon, 01 Apr 1996 10:38:10 PST\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:alltop@scfe.chinalake.navy.mil\">alltop@scfe.chinalake.navy.mil</A>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        four lines\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nApril 1, 1996\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\nDavid Eppstein,\n\nYour Geometry Junkyard is very interesting and informative.\nBelow are remarks pertaining to the four lines, and their\npossible generalizations to higher dimensions, attributed \nto Jim Buddenhagen.  \n\nI'm assuming a finite set of lines in  3-space to be\nin gp (general position) provided no two of them lie in\na plane.  \n\nI don't think that four lines in gp in 3-space always admit\na common skewer, i.e. a line which intersects all four.\n\nFor example, consider the four lines  L(i)  represented\nparametrically by the four real parameters  u(i):\n\n       L(1) :  ( u(1),     1,   -1 )         \n\n       L(2) :  (   -1,  u(2),    1 )         \n\n       L(3) :  (    1,    -1, u(3) )         \n\n       L(4) :  ( u(4),  u(4), u(4) ) .\n\nThe first three lines are parallel to the coordinate axes,\nintercepting the coordinate planes in  ( 0, 1,-1), (-1, 0, 1)\nand  ( 1,-1, 0), respectively.  The fourth passes through the \norigin with direction ( 1, 1, 1).  None of the six pairs lies\nin a plane.\n\nAccording to my calculations no line intersects all four.\nGrinding through the algebra yields the requirement that\n\n                  u(4)**2 = -1/3 .\n\nI suspect that something like the following takes place.  \nIf we have three lines  L(i), i=1,2,3,  in gp in 3-space, the\nunion of all lines  K  which intersect all  L(i)  forms a \n(quadratic?) surface. Furthermore, these lines  K  are\ndisjoint and form a decomposition of the surface. \n\nA  fourth line  L(4)  may intersect that \nsurface in  zero points, one tangent point, two points or\nthe line  L(4)  itself.  This would imply that four lines in \ngp in 3-space would admit zero, one, two  or an entire \ncontinuum of common skewers.\n\nIf this is roughly correct (whatever that means), generalizations\nmay not be easy to formulate.\n\nIf this is wrong, I plead 'April Fool'.\n\nBill Alltop  \nCode 474400D\nChina Lake, CA 93555\n619-939-3034\n<A HREF=\"mailto:alltop@rattler.chinalake.navy.mil\">alltop@rattler.chinalake.navy.mil</A>\n\nCopies to:  <A HREF=\"mailto:ebudden@artsci.wustl.edu\">ebudden@artsci.wustl.edu</A>\n            <A HREF=\"mailto:rusin@washington.math.niu.edu\">rusin@washington.math.niu.edu</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:alltop@scfe.chinalake.navy.mil\">alltop@scfe.chinalake.navy.mil</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        four lines\n<B>Date:</B>           Mon, 01 Apr 1996 11:07:29 -0800\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nFrom D.
