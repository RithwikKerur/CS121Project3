( <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Start -> All Programs -> PostgreSQL 8.3 -> Start server</font>. )</p>\n\n<li><p>Using psql, pgAdmin or similar program, log in as the testuser (you created this user in phase 0) and create the database. Enter the database name in all lower case.

In psql the commands are\n\n<pre>\npostgres=>create database fabflixs;\nCREATE DATABASE\\a\npostgres=>\\q\n</pre>\n\n<li><p>The fabflixs database now exists. To access it again, you open the <font class = \"codeFaceSmall\">fabflixs</font> database as user <font class = \"codefacesmall\">testuser</font>\n.</p>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<h3>Creating the database tables</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>The following chart gives the FabFlixs database schema; given for each table is its name, its attributes, and constraints on the attributes. </p>\n\n<p>Each varchar() field for which there is no data (i.e., the field contents are missing or unknown) is the empty string (''); other non-required fields which have no data are null. Required fields have the constraint that they are not null, not empty and do not consist solely of whitespace (blanks, tabs, etc.). An attribute or group of attributes designated as a primary key should be implemented as such. (See <a href= \"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/ddl-constraints.html\">PostgreSQL 8.3.7 Documentation, Chapter 5.3, Constraints</a> for more information about constraints.)</p>\n\n<p>SQL statements to insert the information from the previous system into their appropriate tables are in the script file  <a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/cs122b/Project/04-FabFlixsTestData.txt\"> FabFlixsTestData.txt</a>. The tables from which this data came sometimes do not have the same structure as the corresponding FabFlixs tables, as FabFlixs is a major upgrade; obviously, you will need to read the data out of these records and place it into the correct FabFlixs fields, in the correct format. The affected data, and what must be done to make it FabFlixs compatible, is discussed below.</p>\n\n<h4>Credit card data and ids</h4>\n\n<p>Note that the previous system stored credit card numbers as numbers in the credit card file, but as strings in the customer file (yet another good reason to move to a new system)! In FabFlixs, the credit cards numbers are stored as strings (see the table definitions, below); be sure to convert the data as necessary.</p>\n<p>Typical (though perhaps unexpected)\ncredit card account and use rules that affect the FabFlixs schema\ninclude the following:\n<ul>\n<li>The same card number can be associated with different names;\nthat is, more than one person can share an account.\n<li>Anyone, with permission, can use anyone's credit card, so\nthe customer's name need not be the same as any of the names\non the account. Someone in possession of the account number\nis considered to be an authorized user unless the\ncredit card firm has been otherwise notified.\nSo, credit card number is not a unqiue identifier: card\nnumber with card holder's name is.\n</ul>\n\n<p>For security reasons, and to avoid an update of the customer file if\ncredit card info is changed, we specifiy the use of a\nnumeric, automatically generated key in the customer file \nthat references (is a foreign key of) the credit card file. But there is no\nsuch key in the data to be imported into the FabFlixs database; the\nprevious system did not use this identifier, but instead used the credit\ncard number as the key. An attempt to insert \nexisting records into the customer table will have credit card\nnumbers treated as keys (a violation of requirements); an attempt\nto insert a credit card record would result in data populating the\nwrong fields! Yet the specs must still be met; what to do?</p>\n\n<p>This issue can be handled a few ways; here's one straight-ahead solution:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create the customer table as given in the schema, but without the foreign\n\tkey contraint on the cc_id field; when the table is populated, the credit card \n\tid will be placed in the cc_id field.\n\t<li>Create the credit card table, without the id field.\n\t<li>Populate the table.\n\t<li>Add the credit card table id field.\n\t<li>Write a SQL scipt or other program that, \n\tstarting at 1, assigns values to the credit card id file. As\n\teach id is assigned, use that record's credit card number to\n\tlocate the customer record with that number (it will be in the\n\tcc_id field) and replace it with the credit card id.\n\t<li>Add the foreign key constraint to the cc_id in the customer table.\n</ul>\n\n<p>The imported data may have errors; we must deal with them:\n<ul>\n\t<li> <p>If a credit card numbers is not 15 or 16 digits, it is invalid; store \"invalid\" as the credit card number.</p>\n\t<li><p>If a credit card record has a credit card number that does not corespond to an imported customer, do not inport the credit card record into the new system.</p>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Director names</h4>\n\n<p>\t<li><p>The provided data has each director's name as one field, with the name beginning with the first name and ending with the last.  Thus, searching and sorting by director, required in a later phase, is rather problematic. Required, then, is to have the director's name broken into last name and \"rest of name.\" A reasonable approach to accomplish this is to\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create the movie file with only one of the director fields, director_last_name.\n\t<li>Populate the table.\n\t<li>Add the director_rest_of_name field to the table.\n\t<li>Go through the movie table; for each movie, extract\n\tthe director's name, break it into last name and rest-of-name;\n\tstore the last-name back into the director_last_name field, the rest-of-name\n\tinto the director_rest_of_name field, storing 'none' if rest-of-name is\n\tempty.\n</ul>\n\n<p>Use your best efforts to extract the last name from the directors's name; management knows that it's impossible to be perfectly accurate.</p>\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>Stars and Genres</h4>\n\n<p>It is legal for a movie(e.g. a documentary about a museum) to have no affiliated stars.</p>\n\n<p>In this (new) FabFlics system, every movie will have at least one genre. If, when importing data, it is discovered that their is no genre associated with the movie, we still import it, knowing that it will not appear in any \"by genre\" search (See Phase 2). However, we can find such movies via the data cleaning report (see Phase 3); once this report is available, it is management's intent to correct the database so that all movies have at least one genre.</p>\n\n\n<h4>Sales</h4>\n\n<p>The previous sytem did not track the number of items sold--each time a DVD was sold, it was entered as a separate line item (e.g., if a single customer bought four copies of Chicken Run in one transaction, four separate records would be added to the sales file). It also did not store the shipping address (it was used for the shipping label, then disgarded). So the test data does not have quantity nor shipping address values, but the new tables expect them; what to do?</p>\n\n<p>Here is one way to solve the problem:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>Create the sales table without the quantity and shipping address fields.\n\t<li>Populate the table.\n\t<li>Add the quantity field; set it to 1 for all records.\n\t<li>Add the shipping address field; set it to blanks.\n</ul>\n\n<h4>One-Step Conversion</h4>\n\n<p>Since the INSERTs to place into the tables is all in one file, and not grouped at all for easy subdivision or modification, best is to effect all the table changes at once; that is </p>\n<ol>\n\t<li>Set up FabFlixs with the 'temporary' table structures, as discussed above, needed for the  imported data to be inserted in the correct fields.\n\t<li>Run the script to insert the data into the database.\n\t<li>Update the tables as discussed above, converting data as needed.\n</ol>\n<p>You may find the use of BAT files heplful in this process; note that the \"&lt;\" operator allows bat files to accept information from a specified input file and \"&gt;\" sends the results of BAT processing to a text file.</p>\n\n\n<h4>FabFlixs schema</h4>\n\n<table style=\"width: 100%;

for example, ensure the database does not allow a movie record to be created without its associated stars_in_movie and genres_in_movie records also being created, that \"orphan records\" (e.g., a credit card record without a corresponding customer record) can't exist, and so on.</p>\n\n\t<p>The imported movie data has not been cleaned; that is, it may have errors. Phase 3 will implement data cleaning. In particular, the database may have records that appear to be duplicates; that is, they are (almost) the same except for their ID number. That's ok, in that they will cause no database errors. It's not OK if the records really contain duplicate information, but that will be addressed in Phase 3.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have populated the database, <i>modify or add to these records to ensure all types of legal records are represented</i>. For instance, the provided set has no records for people with one name; add records that do. We need a robust test set for the remaining phases to ensure specifications are met for all legal data.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, once the database is populated, further restrict fields as feasible to prevent errors. (Additional error checking, of course, may be done by programs that accept data and place it into the database.) </p>\n\n<p>For all user interactions with the database's tables, such as with the employee access program below, make <i>very</i> sure the user only is allowed to view, change or look things up in fields that are appropriate to the task. For example, when new records are entered into the database, their ids should be automatically generated: There is no need to force the user to come up with some id that does not duplicate an id already in the table. (See the <a href= \"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.3/interactive/datatype.html#DATATYPE-SERIAL\"> SERIAL data type, section 8.3.7 of the postgreSQL manual</a> for a good way to generate ids auotmatically.) Yet, when correcting or deleting ani item, such as a star or movie, an employee can often do so more quickly by entering its unique id then first searching by its name and then, say, choosing the particular item from a list (though the program might also allow that method).</p>\n</ul>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<h3>Allowing Employee Access to the Database</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Authorized employees will be allowed to directly access the FabFlixs\ndatabase; we are to provide a simple interface for them to issue common\ncommands, as well as a way to enter an arbitrary SQL statement. (We do not allow them\ndirect access to psql or pgAdmin because these tools contain powerful &#151;and dangerous&#151; features that FabFlixs employees (except the DB developers) do not require.)\nFor this phase, we get the application l; in a later phase, we add appropriate\nsecurity so employees can access only functions for which they are authorized.\n\n<p>In an actual development effort, the l and look-and-feel\nrequirements for these functions would have been specified in every\nparticular.  We've purposely left these requirements high-level because\nwe want you to use your skills, experience and reasoned judgment to refine\nthem. Do feel free to ask the instructor or TA for advice!\nWith your project manager's permission, you can also enhance these specifications\nfor potential additional credit; for example, you can use a GUI or  Web-based user\ninterface rather than a console interface, or access these functions via a <i>secure</i> web page. \nBut be careful: including additional features that do not work will <i>detract</i> from your score.</p>\n\n<p>Write a Java program that, using JDBC to interface with\n\tpostgreSQL, provides for the following lity. It can be console\n\tbased (or GUI or web-based, as discussed above). You may use a different\n\tlanguage and ODBC library, provided you have received approval from \n\tyour project manager.  In any event, <i>you must use posegreSQL</i>.</p>\n\t\n<p>When this program is run, the user is asked\n\tfor the the user name and the user password for the\n\tfabflixs database. If all is well, the employee is granted access\n\t(and a message to that effect appears on the screen);\n\tif access is not allowed, it says why (e.g., the database\n\tis not present, the password is wrong). Allow a way\n\tfor the employee to exit easily. Note that an incorrect password \n\tgenerates an SQLException, so catch this exception to deal \n\tnicely with wrong passwords.</p>\n\n<p>Provide a menu that allows the employee to</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><p>Print out (to the screen) the movies featuring a user-selected star.\n      <br>The star can be chosen via first name and last name or by ID.\n\t<br>All movie attributes should appear, labeled and neatly arranged.\n</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Print out (to the screen) a nice, neat list of  the genres of the movies\n    in which a particular star appeared;  the star can be chosen via first name and last name or by ID.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Insert a star for a particular movie (do not ask for an id; see above).</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Insert a customer into the database (do not ask for an id). If a credit card number entered with this customer does not exist, also create the appropriate credit card record. (The intent is that a customer must have a credit card on file.)</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Insert a movie into the database (again, do not ask for an ID).</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Associate an existing star with a particular movie. Allow searching for the star by last and first name or ID, and the movie by name or ID, so that the user does not have to scan the whole database for the appropriate record IDs. For instance, if you are using a console interface, enter the movie title and have the program return a list of movies that match the query, from which the user picks one;  do the same for the star; use the selected name and start to create the association. If you are using a GUI, create drop down menus on which the entries are alphabetically sorted, and allow them to be selected.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Delete a star from the database. Deal nicely with the situation where the star record cannot be deleted because it is associated with a movie.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Delete a genre from the database. Deal nicely with the situation where the genre record cannot be deleted because it is associated with a movie.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Delete a movie from the database. </p></li>\n\t<li><p>Delete a customer from the database. (Don't delete associated credit card data; it's possible for two people to be \"on\" the same credit card, and we also want to maintain credit card history.)</p></li>\n\t<p>Deletions can be accomplished by entering an ID, or by slecting the particular item from a list that resulted from one of the (implied) searches above. For instance, if a start is to be deleted, and the star's name is entered, three stars with the same name may appear. The user then selects one of these three stars to delete.</p>\n\t<li><p>Provide the metadata of the database; in particular, print out the name of each table and, for each table, each attribute and its type.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Enter an arbitrary SQL command.</p></li>\n\t<li><p>Exit the menu (and return to the get-the-database/user/password state).</p>\n\t<li<p>Exit the program.</p>\n  </ul>\n\n<p>In cases where the requested tasks cannot be accomplished,\nhandle the error gracefully: Do not just pass along\nsome Java exception!</p>\n\n<p>Whenever feasible, allow the user to cancel a command in progress (in case s/he made an error). For example, when selecting which star to delete from a menu of three choices, allow the user to simply not select any of them. Or, when deleting by ID, ask for confirmation; if the user does not confirm, do not delete the item.</p>\n\n<p>For those functions where many lines could print,\ndisplay lines in groups of 20 or so, so that the employee can\nread the contents before they scroll off the top of the screen.\nFor example, after printing 20 lines, say \"Hit any key to continue\"\nand when a key is hit, display the next 20 lines. (Obviously, this will\nbe somewhat different if you use a GUI or Web interface; nonetheless,\nnicely handle the situation when there is more data than will fit on a screen.)</p>\n\n<p>Upon completion of any command except the exit commands,\nthe user is returned to the menu.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<h3>Demonstration</h3>\n</div>\n<p>Create a running system from your ZIP file, <i>quickly</i>.
