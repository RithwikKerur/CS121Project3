One way to check accuracy is to compare books in\ncases where duplicate data is available.  Another way to check accuracy\nis to assemble all the records for one family and look for inconsistency\nof detail.  The error details that are most obvious are house numbers,\nages, maiden names, and given names of parents and grandparents.\nThe general impression is that the sections of books with good penmanship\ntend to have fewer errors.\n<P>\nThe amount of information in a record is not standard.\nThe amount of information varies from place to place and from time to time.\n<P>\nMost of the Poland LDS microfilms are from the 19th Century.\nRecords less than 100 years old are generally not filmed although some have been.\nRecords more than 200 years old are less common because few record books survived.\n\n<LI> Widows\n<P>\nA remarriage of a widow does not always mention the name of her previous husband.\nAt least in south Poland before 1800, a widow's family name in a record\nis usually the family name of her prior husband.\nWatch out for widows with only one family name recorded.\nThe format \"Mary daughter of John Szymanski a widow\"\nmakes it clear that Szymanski is the maiden name.\nThe format \"Mary Szymanska a widow\" is ambiguous.\n\n<LI> Banns\n<P>\nThe Banns are the official announcement that a couple plan to marry.\nThree readings of the banns, in church, were required back then.\nThe priest was required to keep a record of which dates the banns\nwere read.  Few Banns books survive, but when available they are useful\nrecords, particularly when the actual marriage records are missing,\nsince the banns record usually includes the marriage date.\nSometimes the dates for reading of the banns are added to the Marriage record, too.\n\n<LI> Age\n<P>\nNineteenth century Poles were not as aware of their age as we are.\nWhere parent age and age of witnesses is recorded, there are examples\nof more than 20 records for one individual.\nThe discrepancy of recorded age vs actual age is sometimes as large as\n10 years.  On the other hand, there are examples of other individuals\nwhose age is always correct.\n<P>\nNevertheless, recorded age, when available, can be useful for\nidentification if there are 2 individuals in town with the same name\nbut very different age.\n<P>\nDeath ages of old people are notoriously exaggerated, as everywhere in\nthe world.  Some are accurate, but most seem to be recorded as much\nolder than calculated from the birth record (when available and definite).\n<P>\nAs expected, ages at marriage tend to fib a little, with the person\nrecorded as older for people less than 20 and as younger for widows\nand widowers over 30.\n\n<LI> Feminine Name Inflections\n<P>\nPolish language books explain that the family name of Polish females\nis inflected to indicate if she is married or single.\nThe books may mention that there are many different ways of doing this.\nIt is very confusing.\nThe books may not mention that even Poles get confused by name inflections.\nThe \"always married\" inflections seem to be inconsistent,\nbeing sometimes used for unmarried young women.\nThere are \"always single\" inflections, such as \"-cionka\".\nCheck out the Translation Tips web sites.\nSome records avoid feminine inflections by using a format like\n\"Mary daughter of John Szymanski\".\n<P>\nSummary:  When a marriage or death or witness record for a woman does\nnot mention her status, one of the diminutive inflections tells you she\nis unmarried, even if she is old.  On the other hand, the various adult\ninflections tell you nothing unless you can find a pattern for that\nparticular record book by studying the book as a whole.\n\n<LI> Family Name Spelling and Inflection\n<P>\nPolish spelling was not standard in the 19th century.\nPoles use various inflections, or variations for names.\nFor example, in the 19th century records, Kolodziejczak family members\nare also recorded as Kolodziejczyk and Kolodziejski.\nThat \"l\" is usually but not always crossed, and of course the\ncrossed \"l\" is often indistinguishable from a \"t\".\n\n<LI> Name Changes and Aliases\n<P>\nApparently, it was not very uncommon to use a first name \"around the house\"\nthat is different than the name of record.\n<P>\nAlias family names were used.  Some are recorded with the Latin word\n\"alias\".  For example there was more than one Gwozdz family in a village\nthat used the name Knap.  To confuse the issue, there was at least one\nfamily that used the name Knap exclusively.\n<P>\nSometimes, people changed their family names.\nThat can be difficult to spot in the records.\nFor example, one ancestral family (in Szelkow, north Poland) used the\nnames Bajtko and Bajtczak before 1800.\nMost Poles would consider Bajtko and Bajtczak as valid inflections of\nthe same name.  After about 1800, the family switched to Banasiak,\nwhich is clearly a different name.  It was not a clean switch.\nNot everyone in the family changed at the same time.\nSome did not change, and there were people not related with the same names.\nHere is a example convincing record:\nApolonia Bajtko was married 25 Feb 1820.\nThe first witnesses is Jozef Bajtczak, brother of the bride.\nThe second witness is Jozef Banasiak, uncle of the bride on her father's\nside (the Polish word \"styia\" is used for this relationship).\nThe priest who wrote the record felt no need to explain why they were all\nusing different family names.\n\n<LI> Unknown Names\n<P>\nMany records indicate that the name of a person is unknown.\nMost commonly it is a maiden name, but you will see this also for given names.\nRarely the name of the person of record is indicated as unknown.\n<P>\nThere are several possible reasons: (1) the person has no name,\n(2) the name was unknown at the time of the record,\nand (3) the name was illegible at the time of copying of the record.\n<P>\nAn example is the word \"beznazwisko\", which literally means\n\"without family name\".  Certainly that word should be used for people who\nin fact do not have a family name.  However, there is a significant example\nwhere the word \"beznazwisko\" was used to indicate that the name was unknown\nto the person making an index.\n<P>\nAnother word is \"niewiadomego\" which means \"unknown\".\nOften seen is \"niewiadomego nazwiska\", which means \"unknown family name\".\nAgain, it is usually ambiguous if the name was unknown at the time of record\nor just illegible at the time of copying.\n<P>\nIn south Poland unknown names are usually indicated by \"N.\", which presumably\nis the abbreviation for niewiadomego.\n</UL>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
