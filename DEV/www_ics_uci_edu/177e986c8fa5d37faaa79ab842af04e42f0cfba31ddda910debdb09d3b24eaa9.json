Such businesses provide the following\r\nbenefits to end users: a) anytime, anywhere access to data; b) low\r\ncost; and c) good quality of service. Examples of data storage\r\nproviders include Amazon S3 service, Windows SkyDrive, Nirvarnix,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nUsers face two challenges in utilizing the storage infrastructures\r\nof the IDPs: a) Heterogeneity: Different IDPs provide\r\ndifferent interfaces to application developers to store and fetch\r\ndata with them due to lack of accepted standards; and b)\r\nSecurity: Data outsourced to IDPs is vulnerable to attacks\r\nfrom the internet thieves and from malicious employees of IDPs.\r\n\r\nTo combat the above problems we present DataGuard, which is a client\r\nside interoperable security middleware that adapts to the\r\nheterogeneity of interfaces of IDP and enforces security constraints\r\non outsourced data. This significantly simplifies the effort for\r\napplication development. To combat heterogeneity, DataGuard\r\nincorporates an abstract service model that can be easily customized\r\nto several IDPs. To address the security challenges, DataGuard\r\nsupports a security model that protects the confidentiality and\r\nintegrity of outsourced data. We propose a novel indexing technique\r\nthat allows search on the encrypted data stored at the IDPs. We\r\nillustrate the feasibility/efficacy of DataGuard, by implementing\r\nthe middleware and executing it on two of the popular IDPs, Amazon\r\nS3 service and Gmail.com. <br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\nFor more information regarding the project please visit <a href=\"http://DataGuard.ics.uci.edu\"> http://DataGuard.ics.uci.edu </a>. Here you will also find the prototype\r\nof the system available for free download.   <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n <font size=3 color = \"teal\"> DataProtector: </font> <br>\r\n\r\n\r\nOutsourcing personal information to web based data services (WDS) is a common recent trend. \r\nWebsites such as Gmail.com, Flickr.com and Google Docs are examples of such services. \r\nCurrent WDSs provide a variety of data services that allow data storage, backup, sharing, etc. \r\nThese services have become so popular that they are now a part of our daily life. \r\nThe biggest drawback of such services is the requirement to trust the service provider. \r\nData outsourced is stored in plaintext and is vulnerable to outsider attacks from hackers/Internet thieves and insider attacks from malicious employees. <br>\r\n\r\nTo combat the above issues, we propose DataProtector, a security middleware for web based data services. \r\nDataProtector acts as a transparent middleman between the browser and the web server and enforces security requirements at \r\nthe level of HTTP requests. DataProtector utilizes a rule based framework for determining the \r\nflow of sensitive information via HTTP requests/responses and protects the confidentiality and integrity of \r\nsuch information using cryptographic techniques. DataProtector is a generic middleware that can protect data outsourced \r\nto a wide variety of WDSs. We implemented a proof-of-concept DataProtector prototype to measure its performance. <br> <br>\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding the project please visit <a href=\"http://DataProtector.ics.uci.edu\"> http://DataProtector.ics.uci.edu </a>.  <br><br>\r\n \r\n<font size=3 color = \"teal\"> DataVault: </font> <br>\r\n\r\nDataVault is an architecture designed for Web users that allows them to securely access their data from any machine connected to the Internet \r\nand also lets them selectively share their data with trusted peers. The DataVault architecture is built on the outsourced database model (ODB), \r\nwhere clients/users outsource their database to a remote service provider who provides data management services such backup, recovery, \r\ntransportability and data sharing. In DataVault, the service provider is untrusted. The confidentiality and integrity of the user's data \r\nis preserved using cryptographic techniques. The service provider manages encrypted data. \r\nDataVault utilizes a novel PKI infrastructure and encrypted storage model that allow data sharing to take place via an untrusted server. <br><br>\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding the project please visit <a href=\"http://ics.uci.edu/~rjammala/DataVault\"> http://ics.uci.edu/~rjammala/DataVault </a>. Here you will also find the prototype\r\nof the system available for free download.  <br><br>\r\n\r\n \r\n<font size=3 color = \"teal\"> pVault: </font> <br>\r\n\r\nPvault software is a personal data manager that stores and retrieves data \r\nfrom a remote untrusted data server securely. The major advantage of Pvault is that it allows users to access \r\ntheir personal data from any trusted remote computer. We will describe the issues and solutions for maintaining \r\ndata confidentiality and integrity when the data is stored at the remote sever, since the server itself is untrusted.\r\nPvault also prevents Phishing and Pharming attacks and we will describe the solutions for the same.  <br><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information regarding the project please visit <a href=\"http://www.itr-rescue.org/pVault/\"> http://www.itr-rescue.org/pVault/ \r\n</a>.
