Our group\nhas a long and successful history of developing new ideas and algorithms that lie at the intersection of machine \nlearning and statistics. We are\nalso involved in numerous applications, working with expert collaborators to apply machine learning\nand statistical techniques to address real-world problems across a variety of important application\nareas in medicine, science, engineering, the social sciences, and business. <br>\n<p>\nPhD students interested in joining our \n<a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/research_group.html\">\nDatalab research group</a> should apply to either the\n<b> Computer Science or Statistics PhD programs </b> at UC Irvine. Students with strong quantitative backgrounds are encouraged to apply (with undergraduate or Master's degrees in areas such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Mathematics, or related areas).\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBelow are some examples of current and recent projects in our group. The list below is illustrative\nrather than exhaustive - we have broad interests in our research group and are often exploring new ideas and projects that are not listed below.\n</p>\n\n\n<ul class=\"w3-ul\">\n<p></p>\n\n<li>\n <b> Statistical and probabilistic methods for deep learning </b><br>\nDeveloping new theories and techniques that bridge statistical ideas with methods from deep learning, such as\nBayesian forecasting and online probabilistic calibration for deep neural networks.
