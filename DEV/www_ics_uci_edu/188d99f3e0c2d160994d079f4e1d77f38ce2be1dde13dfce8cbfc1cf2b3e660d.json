For any <i>t</i> the\ncorresponding minimum number of subsequences which are sufficient\nto reconstruct uniquely an unknown sequence is found. An algorithm\nfor reconstructing sequences by this minimum number of their\nsubsequences based on majority and threshold functions is\npresented. As a preliminary result, for any <i>t</i> the maximum\nnumber of sequences of length <i>n&nbsp;-&nbsp;t</i> of a binary\nsequence of length <i>n</i> is found. In discussing general\napplicability and extensibility of algorithms for this problem,\nbounds are given on the average number of sequences of length <i>\nn&nbsp;-&nbsp;t</i> of a binary sequence of length <i>n</i>.</p>\n\n<p>The presentation consists of work due to Vladimir I.\nLevenshtein<sup>*</sup> plus extensions due to Dan Hirschberg.</p>\n\n<p><sup>*</sup> V.
