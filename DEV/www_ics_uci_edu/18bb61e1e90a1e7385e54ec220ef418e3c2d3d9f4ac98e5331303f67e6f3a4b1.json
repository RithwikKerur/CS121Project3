The workshop invitees are computer architects and compiler,\noperating system, and application experts. The main goal of the workshop\nis to discuss future trends in the development of architecture and\nsoftware systems and to explore the assumptions made by the architects  \nabout software systems and by software writers about architecture.\nThe increased complexity in each of these areas calls for increased\ninteraction with researchers from all of the other disciplines to accurately\nassess the potential directions and future trends in architecture and systems.\n</p>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nThe main themes of the workshop are application requirements and\ncharacteristics, compiler/architecture interaction and codesign, and software-\nand technology-driven and constrained new architectures. Numerical\nand non-numerical applications, in particular database, data mining,\nWeb- and Java-based applications, are of interest.  \nIn all cases a longer-term view\nand assessment of the future is of most interest.\n</p>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nThis year we will concentrate on computation and memory\nintensive applications, i.e. applications requiring more CPU power,\nmore memory bandwidth and lower memory latency than present or projected systems\ncan provide.  Workshop topics of  interest will deal with this type of\napplications and include but are not limited to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Application characteristics\n<li> Their requirements and impact on system architecture and compilation\n<li> Approaches to better map applications/algorithms to systems with traditional\n   architecture, memory hierarchy\n<li> Application community's view of whether the architectural limitations are fundamental\n   or can be overcome by the use of different/new algorithms\n<li> New architectural approaches to application problems as perceived by architects\n<li> Modeling, benchmarking, and performance evaluation of such applications  \n</ul>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nAdditional workshop areas of interest include the perennial favorites below,\nbut preference will be given to submissions on the above-mentioned topics.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Clusters, SAN, and FibreChannel-based systems <br>\n<li> PC-based parallel computing <br>\n<li> Single-chip multiprocessors, multi-chip servers and large-scale multiprocessors <br>\n<li> Memory technology and system organization <br>\n<li> Systems On a Chip (SOC) <br>\n<li> Java-based computing <br>\n</ul>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nThe workshop will consist of sessions combining individual presentations \nwith discussion.  Presentations will be limited to 15 min to provide sufficient\ntime for discussion.  An ideal presentation will concentrate on trends and future\ndirections rather than recently obtained results.  Speculation is encouraged.\n</p>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\n<b> Workshop participation is capped at 50 invitees.  <br>\nRSVP by Sept.30th, 1999\nif you plan to attend. </b>\n</p>\n\n\n<H3><B> <a name=\"publ\">  </a> </B></H3>\n<b> Submission and Publication </b> </center>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\n   An extended abstract, up to 3 pages, should be submitted by 10/10/99.\n   Submissions should electronic and in postscript  or pdf format.\n   Papers will be refereed on the basis of the extended abstract and\n   accepted for either regular or short presentation.

In the latter case one has to catch a very short\ncommuter flight from Honolulu to Maui.   <br>\nSee maps and directions below for\nairport, Prince hotel, and MHPCC locations.\n<br>\n<li>\nRegistration fee: US$100.00 to cover publication costs and some of\nthe local expenses.\n<br>\n<li>\nCar rental is recommended to drive to/from the airport, MHPCC meeting room,\nand the hotel.  Car pooling will also be possible.\n<br>\n<li>\nThe workshop hotel is the <b> Maui Prince </b> where we have a special rate contract ($130). Reservations have to be made by 10/15 and will require a 2 night deposit (can be cancelled without penalty up to a week before arrival).  Phone number for reservations is <b> (800)-321-6248 </b>.\n<br>\nIt is possible to stay a few extra days at the same rate before and after the\nmeeting.\n<br>\nA number of condominiums (1 to 3 bedroom) will be available for those\npreferring apartment living. Their price is similar.\n<br>\n<li>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.mhpcc.edu/general/Directions.html\"> Maps and directions\n</A> to Maui HPCC, Maui Prince, and condominiums.\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nSend questions/mail about IWIA to <a href=\"mailto:alexv@ics.uci.edu\"><font\n                size=\"4\"> Alex Veidenbaum </font></a>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
