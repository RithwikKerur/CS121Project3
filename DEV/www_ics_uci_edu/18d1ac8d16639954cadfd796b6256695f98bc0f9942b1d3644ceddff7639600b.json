He urges that men of science should\nthen turn to the massive task of making more accessible our\nbewildering store of knowledge.  For many years inventions have\nextended man's physical powers rather than the powers of his mind.\nTrip hammers that multiply the fists, microscopes that sharpen the\neye, and engines of destruction and detection are new results, but the\nend results, of modern science.  Now, says Dr. Bush, instruments are\nat hand which, if properly developed, will give man access to and\ncommand over the inherited knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of\nthese pacific instruments should be the first objective of our\nscientists as they emerge from their war work.  Like Emerson's famous\naddress of 1837 on ``The American Scholar,'' this paper by Dr. Bush\ncalls for a new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our\nknowledge. <address>- The Editor</address>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"intro.html\">Introduction</a>\n  <li><a href=\"section1.html\">Section 1</a>\n  <li><a href=\"section2.html\">Section 2</a>\n  <li><a href=\"section3.html\">Section 3</a>\n  <li><a href=\"section4.html\">Section 4</a>\n  <li><a href=\"section5.html\">Section 5</a>\n  <li><a href=\"section6.html\">Section 6</a>\n  <li><a href=\"section7.html\">Section 7</a>\n  <li><a href=\"section8.html\">Section 8</a>\n</ul>\n\n<b>Note:</b>\nIn the original article, sections are numbered with no headings.\nI have added the above menu, as well as navigational links at the top\nand bottom of each section.
