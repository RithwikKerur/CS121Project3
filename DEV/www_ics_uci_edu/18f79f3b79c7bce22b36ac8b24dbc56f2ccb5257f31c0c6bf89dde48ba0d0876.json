The software\nhas been updated on a more or less regular basis by IJG.\n\nThe \"official\" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet\naddress 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found\nthere in directory graphics/jpeg.  If you are on the Internet, you\ncan retrieve files from ftp.uu.net by standard anonymous FTP.\n\nNumerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files; in particular,\nyou can probably find a copy at any site that archives comp.sources.misc\nsubmissions.  However, only ftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest\nofficial version.\n\nThe JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of\ngeneral information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is\nnot included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to\nUsenet newsgroups comp.graphics, news.answers, and other groups.  You can\nalways obtain the latest version from the news.answers archive at\nrtfm.mit.edu.  By FTP, fetch /pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1 and\n.../part2.\n\nThis software is the work of Tom Lane, Philip Gladstone, Luis Ortiz, Jim\nBoucher, Lee Crocker, Julian Minguillon, George Phillips, Davide Rossi,\nGe' Weijers, and other members of the Independent JPEG Group.\n\nIJG is not associated with the official ISO JPEG standards committee.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
