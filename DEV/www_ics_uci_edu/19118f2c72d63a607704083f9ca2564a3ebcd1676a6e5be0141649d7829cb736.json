My name is Mayara. I\u2019m a PhD candidate in the HAI Lab at University of California, Irvine. I am Brazilian, from the Amazon, and proud of it. I have both a Bachelor\u2019s and a Master\u2019s in Computer Science from the Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1, Brazil, where I started my studies working with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Software Engineering, especially Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). In my Bachelor\u2019s, I developed tools for an e-learning environment, for supporting heuristic evaluations, impact analysis, and software traceability in distributed teams. I also participated in studies of analysis of social networks in open source projects. In my Master\u2019s, I conducted a qualitative study about the work of IT architects. I conducted intensive qualitative work, interviewing IT architects from 9 different software development companies and using Grounded Theory techniques for data analysis. My Master\u2019s thesis describes the different types of architecture roles, how they interact, and their importance in the transfer, translation, and transformation of knowledge within the project. For more information, see my papers on the Publications page.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>After earning my Master\u2019s, I worked as a requirement analyst in an IT company in the banking sector, and then as an IT analyst in the same University where I studied. In this last position, I was in charge of the adaptation and deployment of the new academic system, which has around 30,000 users; this was a major challenge and valuable experience.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>I am now happy to be working on my PhD in the Golden State, at the University of California, Irvine. I am working in health informatics, focusing on the use, benefits, and consequences (positive and negative) of self-tracking technologies for health. You can always check my Publications page for more information; I do my best to keep it up-to-date.</p>\n\n\t\t<p>Well, that\u2019s it! Obrigada!</p>\n\n\n\n        <div id=\"footer\">\n          <p>Website Copyright &copy; Mayara Costa Figueiredo</a> 2019.</p>\n        </div>\n        <p class=\"text-right\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n      <script src=\"jq/external/jquery/jquery.js\"></script>\n       <script src=\"jq/jquery-ui.js\"></script>\n       <script>\n       \n       \n       $(\"#navbar\").menu({\n       position: { my: \"left top\", at: \"left-0 top+34\" }\n       });\n       \n       \n       </script>\n    \n\t\n\t\n  </body>\n  \n</html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
