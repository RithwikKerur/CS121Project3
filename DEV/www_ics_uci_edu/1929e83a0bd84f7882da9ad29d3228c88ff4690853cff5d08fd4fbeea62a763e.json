An inversion is performed with respect \nto a particular center point and choice of scale; then each point in the \nplane is transformed to another point, forming the same angle to the center \nbut with distance inversely proportional to its original distance.\n\n<P>The center and scale can be specified as a single circle (shown in red \nin the animation below).\nTo invert a point outside this circle, such as the blue one in the bottom \nright of the animation, draw a circle (yellow) having as its \ndiameter the segment from the given point to the inversion circle's center;\nthis circle crosses the inversion circle in two points; connect those \npoints by a line and also draw the perpendicular line from the given point to the \ninversion center (also yellow).  These two lines cross at the inverse of \nthe point.  To invert a point inside the circle, simply reverse these steps.\nThe animation below depicts several geometric figures \n(blue) and their images (green) under inversion through the red circle. \n\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER>\n<applet code     = \"de.cinderella.CindyApplet\"\n        archive = \"cindyrun.jar\"\n        width    = 630\n        height   = 350>\n<param  name=kernelID  value=\"931133398417\">\n<param  name=viewport value=\"de.cinderella.ports.EuclideanPort\">\n<param  name=filename value=\"inversion.cdy\">\n<param  name=polar value= \"false\">\n<param  name=width value= \"630\">\n<param  name=height value=\"350\">\n<param  name=doublebuffer value= \"true\">\n<param  name=mesh value=\"false\">\n<param  name=axes value=\"false\">\n<param  name=snap value=\"false\">\n<param  name=scale value=\"25.0\">\n<param  name=originx value=\"210\">\n<param  name=originy value= \"233\">\n<param  name=deltafactor value= \"0\">\n<param  name=pref0 value=\"cinderella.defaults.background=255,255,255\">\n<IMG SRC=\"inversion.gif\" WIDTH=633 HEIGHT=356\nALT=\"Example inversions\"><BR>\n<SMALL>If you were running Java, you'd see a nice animation instead of this \ngif.</SMALL>\n</applet>\n</DIV>\n\n<P>The key properties of inversion are that it transforms circles to \ncircles, and preserves the angles of crossings between circles; in \nparticular inversion preserves the tangencies of a collection of circles, \nsuch as the <A HREF=\"three-circles.html\">three tangent circles</A> shown \nin the animation.  Note that the blue line through two points is inverted into a circle, \nthrough the center of the inversion.  When interpreting geometric figures \nusing inversion, lines should be viewed as infinite-radius circles that go \nthrough a special \"point at infinity\" which is the image under inversion of \nthe inversion circle's center.\n\n<P>Many geometric constructions and proofs can be simplified by using \ninversion to transform the figure into a more symmetric situation.\n\n<P><HR><P>\nAnimation created by <A HREF=\"http://www.cinderella.de/\">Cinderella</A>.<BR>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"inversion.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
