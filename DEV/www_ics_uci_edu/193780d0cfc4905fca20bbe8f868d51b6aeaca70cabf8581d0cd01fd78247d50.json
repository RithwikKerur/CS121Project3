Since this problem is known to be\nNP-hard we investigate the parameterized complexity of the problem with\nrespect to the vertex cover number, tree-depth, and cyclomatic\nnumber. For these parameters we construct fixed-parameter tractable\nalgorithms. However, the problem remains NP-complete for graphs of\nbounded bandwidth, pathwidth, or treewidth.\n</p>\n\n<p>(Based on joint work with Sergio Cabello and David Eppstein.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
