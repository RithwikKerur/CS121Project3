It is aperiodic (only)\nin the sense that no tiling with it admits a translational\nsymmetry.  This seems to be the standard sense now, and it\nis a good one because in particular it implies that the\ntiles can't be grouped into equal clumps that are all\nembedded similarly in the tiling.\n\n   Take a triangular prism:\n\n            /|\\\n           / | \\\n          /__|  \\\n          \\  \\  |\n           \\  \\ |\n            \\__\\|\n\nMake it \"generic\" - in other words, avoid certain equalities\nbetween the sides and angles.  In particular, don't make the\nside faces be rectangles.  [The apparent right angles in the\ntriangles of my sketch are there only because of the limitations\nof this keyboard.]\n\n    Now take another such prism, again as generic as you can \nget it, subject to the condition that one of its parallelogram\nfaces has the same shape as one of the ones on the first prism,\noriented in such a way that you can stick the two prisms together\nto make a \"biprism\" in which no two triangles share an edge.\nThen this biprism is my tile.\n\n    Which biprisms are sufficiently \"generic\", you may ask.  I\ndon't know a very easy way to find out, though almost all of\nthem are, of course.  Here is what's needed:\n\n    1) It must be impossible to fit the pieces together in any\nway except those in which the constituent prisms line up\nin parallel, triangle-to-triangle:\n\n             /|\\\n            / | \\\n           /__|  \\\n           \\  \\  |\n            \\  \\ | \\\n             \\__\\|  \\\n              \\  \\  |\n               \\  \\ |    \n                \\__\\|\n\n    This sticks the biprisms together in two-dimensional \"waffles\"\nwhich are then stacked to form the whole tiling.  \n\n    2)  The angle of rotation between two adjacent \"waffles\" must\nnot be  60  or  90 degrees.\n\n    I just worked out one case.  I took a rhombus made of two\ntriangles root2,root2,1  for the common face,  and took points\nvertically above and below the midpoints of the edges to be\nthe other four vertices:\n\n                 /\\\n                /  \\\n               A    B\n              /      \\\n             /        \\\n             \\        /\n              \\      /\n               D    C\n                \\  /\n                 \\/\n\n   A and C are above the plane,  B  and  D below it, so that the\n\"roof edges\" of the prisms are  AC  and  BD.\n\n    I made the angles of the triangular faces at these vertices\nbe right angles, but that gives a very flat biprism.  I suggest\nto make them something like  30  degrees for a better shape.\n\n[This will still be generic enough.]    \n\n  I imagine you will be a bit disappointed, because the tiling\nis fairly \"regular\".  But in fact the tiles are necessarily\nembedded in infinitely many distinct ways, however you do it.\n\n                JHC\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
