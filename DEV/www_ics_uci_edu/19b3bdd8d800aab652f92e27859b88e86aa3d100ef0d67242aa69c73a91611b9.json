In\nthis model the data changes gradually and the goal of an algorithm is to\ncompute the solution to some problem on the data at each time step,\nunder the constraint that it only has a limited access to the data each\ntime. As the data is constantly changing and the algorithm might be\nunaware of these changes, it cannot be expected to always output the\nexact right solution; we are interested in algorithms that guarantee to\noutput an approximate solution. In particular, we focus on the\nfundamental problems of sorting and selection, where the true ordering\nof the elements changes slowly. We provide algorithms with performance\nclose to the optimal in expectation and with high probability.\n</p>\n\n(Based on <a href=\"http://aris.me/pubs/bix.pdf\">a paper in ICALP\n2009</a> by Aris Anagnostopoulos, Ravi Kumar, Mohammad Mahdian, and Eli\nUpfal.)\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
