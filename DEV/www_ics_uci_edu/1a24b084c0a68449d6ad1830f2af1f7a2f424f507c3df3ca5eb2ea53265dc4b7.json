This prevents the \"lost update problem,\"\n   in which modifications are lost as first one author then another\n   writes changes without merging the other author's changes.\n\n   Namespace Operations: The ability to instruct the server to copy and\n   move Web resources.\n\n   Requirements and rationale for these operations are described in a\n   companion document, \"Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and\n   Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web\" [RFC2291].\n\n   The sections below provide a detailed introduction to resource\n   properties (section 3), collections of resources (section 5), and\n   locking operations (section 6).  These sections introduce the\n   abstractions manipulated by the WebDAV-specific HTTP methods\n   described in section 8, \"HTTP Methods for Distributed Authoring\".\n\n   In HTTP/1.1, method parameter information was exclusively encoded in\n   HTTP headers. Unlike HTTP/1.1, WebDAV encodes method parameter\n   information either in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) [REC-XML]\n   request entity body, or in an HTTP header.  The use of XML to encode\n   method parameters was motivated by the ability to add extra XML\n   elements to existing structures, providing extensibility; and by\n   XML's ability to encode information in ISO 10646 character sets,\n   providing internationalization support. As a rule of thumb,\n   parameters are encoded in XML entity bodies when they have unbounded\n   length, or when they may be shown to a human user and hence require\n   encoding in an ISO 10646 character set.  Otherwise, parameters are\n   encoded within HTTP headers.  Section 9 describes the new HTTP\n   headers used with WebDAV methods.\n\n   In addition to encoding method parameters, XML is used in WebDAV to\n   encode the responses from methods, providing the extensibility and\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                 [Page 7]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   internationalization advantages of XML for method output, as well as\n   input.\n\n   XML elements used in this specification are defined in section 12.\n\n   The XML namespace extension (Appendix 4) is also used in this\n   specification in order to allow for new XML elements to be added\n   without fear of colliding with other element names.\n\n   While the status codes provided by HTTP/1.1 are sufficient to\n   describe most error conditions encountered by WebDAV methods, there\n   are some errors that do not fall neatly into the existing\n   categories.  New status codes developed for the WebDAV methods are\n   defined in section 10.  Since some WebDAV methods may operate over\n   many resources, the Multi-Status response has been introduced to\n   return status information for multiple resources.  The Multi-Status\n   response is described in section 11.\n\n   WebDAV employs the property mechanism to store information about the\n   current state of the resource.  For example, when a lock is taken\n   out on a resource, a lock information property describes the current\n   state of the lock. Section 13 defines the properties used within the\n   WebDAV specification.\n\n   Finishing off the specification are sections on what it means to be\n   compliant with this specification (section 15), on\n   internationalization support (section 16), and on security (section\n   17).\n\n\n2  Notational Conventions\n\n   Since this document describes a set of extensions to the HTTP/1.1\n   protocol, the augmented BNF used herein to describe protocol\n   elements is exactly the same as described in section 2.1 of\n   [RFC2068].  Since this augmented BNF uses the basic production rules\n   provided in section 2.2 of [RFC2068], these rules apply to this\n   document as well.\n\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].\n\n\n3  Terminology\n\n   URI/URL - A Uniform Resource Identifier and Uniform Resource\n   Locator, respectively. These terms (and the distinction between\n   them) are defined in [RFC2396].\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                 [Page 8]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   Collection - A resource that contains a set of URIs, termed member\n   URIs, which identify member resources and meets the requirements in\n   section 5 of this specification.\n\n   Member URI - A URI which is a member of the set of URIs contained by\n   a collection.\n\n   Internal Member URI - A Member URI that is immediately relative to\n   the URI of the collection (the definition of immediately relative is\n   given in section 5.2).\n\n   Property - A name/value pair that contains descriptive information\n   about a resource.\n\n   Live Property - A property whose semantics and syntax are enforced\n   by the server.  For example, the live \"getcontentlength\" property\n   has its value, the length of the entity returned by a GET request,\n   automatically calculated by the server.\n\n   Dead Property - A property whose semantics and syntax are not\n   enforced by the server.  The server only records the value of a dead\n   property; the client is responsible for maintaining the consistency\n   of the syntax and semantics of a dead property.\n\n   Null Resource - A resource which responds with a 404 (Not Found) to\n   any HTTP/1.1 or DAV method except for PUT, MKCOL, OPTIONS and LOCK.\n   A NULL resource MUST NOT appear as a member of its parent\n   collection.\n\n\n4  Data Model for Resource Properties\n\n4.1 The Resource Property Model\n\n   Properties are pieces of data that describe the state of a resource.\n   Properties are data about data.\n\n   Properties are used in distributed authoring environments to provide\n   for efficient discovery and management of resources.  For example, a\n   'subject' property might allow for the indexing of all resources by\n   their subject, and an 'author' property might allow for the\n   discovery of what authors have written which documents.\n\n   The DAV property model consists of name/value pairs.  The name of a\n   property identifies the property's syntax and semantics, and\n   provides an address by which to refer to its syntax and semantics.\n\n   There are two categories of properties: \"live\" and \"dead\".  A live\n   property has its syntax and semantics enforced by the server. Live\n   properties include cases where a) the value of a property is read-\n   only, maintained by the server, and b) the value of the property is\n   maintained by the client, but the server performs syntax checking on\n\nGoland et al.                                                 [Page 9]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   submitted values. All instances of a given live property MUST comply\n   with the definition associated with that property name.  A dead\n   property has its syntax and semantics enforced by the client; the\n   server merely records the value of the property verbatim.\n\n4.2 Existing Metadata Proposals\n\n   Properties have long played an essential role in the maintenance of\n   large document repositories, and many current proposals contain some\n   notion of a property, or discuss web metadata more generally.  These\n   include PICS [REC-PICS], PICS-NG, XML, Web Collections, and several\n   proposals on representing relationships within HTML. Work on PICS-NG\n   and Web Collections has been subsumed by the Resource Description\n   Framework (RDF) metadata activity of the World Wide Web Consortium.\n   RDF consists of a network-based data model and an XML representation\n   of that model.\n\n   Some proposals come from a digital library perspective.  These\n   include the Dublin Core [RFC2413] metadata set and the Warwick\n   Framework [WF], a container architecture for different metadata\n   schemas.  The literature includes many examples of metadata,\n   including MARC [USMARC], a bibliographic metadata format, and a\n   technical report bibliographic format employed by the Dienst system\n   [RFC1807]. Additionally, the proceedings from the first IEEE\n   Metadata conference describe many community-specific metadata sets.\n\n   Participants of the 1996 Metadata II Workshop in Warwick, UK [WF],\n   noted that \"new metadata sets will develop as the networked\n   infrastructure matures\" and \"different communities will propose,\n   design, and be responsible for different types of metadata.\" These\n   observations can be corroborated by noting that many community-\n   specific sets of metadata already exist, and there is significant\n   motivation for the development of new forms of metadata as many\n   communities increasingly make their data available in digital form,\n   requiring a metadata format to assist data location and cataloging.\n\n4.3 Properties and HTTP Headers\n\n   Properties already exist, in a limited sense, in HTTP message\n   headers.  However, in distributed authoring environments a\n   relatively large number of properties are needed to describe the\n   state of a resource, and setting/returning them all through HTTP\n   headers is inefficient.  Thus a mechanism is needed which allows a\n   principal to identify a set of properties in which the principal is\n   interested and to set or retrieve just those properties.\n\n4.4 Property Values\n\n   The value of a property when expressed in XML MUST be well formed.\n\n   XML has been chosen because it is a flexible, self-describing,\n   structured data format that supports rich schema definitions, and\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 10]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   because of its support for multiple character sets.  XML's self-\n   describing nature allows any property's value to be extended by\n   adding new elements.  Older clients will not break when they\n   encounter extensions because they will still have the data specified\n   in the original schema and will ignore elements they do not\n   understand.  XML's support for multiple character sets allows any\n   human-readable property to be encoded and read in a character set\n   familiar to the user.  XML's support for multiple human languages,\n   using the \"xml:lang\" attribute, handles cases where the same\n   character set is employed by multiple human languages.\n\n4.5 Property Names\n\n   A property name is a universally unique identifier that is\n   associated with a schema that provides information about the syntax\n   and semantics of the property.\n\n   Because a property's name is universally unique, clients can depend\n   upon consistent behavior for a particular property across multiple\n   resources, on the same and across different servers, so long as that\n   property is \"live\" on the resources in question, and the\n   implementation of the live property is faithful to its definition.\n\n   The XML namespace mechanism, which is based on URIs [RFC2396], is\n   used to name properties because it prevents namespace collisions and\n   provides for varying degrees of administrative control.\n\n   The property namespace is flat; that is, no hierarchy of properties\n   is explicitly recognized.  Thus, if a property A and a property A/B\n   exist on a resource, there is no recognition of any relationship\n   between the two properties.  It is expected that a separate\n   specification will eventually be produced which will address issues\n   relating to hierarchical properties.\n\n   Finally, it is not possible to define the same property twice on a\n   single resource, as this would cause a collision in the resource's\n   property namespace.\n\n4.6 Media Independent Links\n\n   Although HTML resources support links to other resources, the Web\n   needs more general support for links between resources of any media\n   type (media types are also known as MIME types, or content types).\n   WebDAV provides such links. A WebDAV link is a special type of\n   property value, formally defined in section 12.4, that allows typed\n   connections to be established between resources of any media type.\n   The property value consists of source and destination Uniform\n   Resource Identifiers (URIs); the property name identifies the link\n   type.\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.

The purpose of a collection resource is to model\n   collection-like objects (e.g., file system directories) within a\n   server's namespace.\n\n   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the HTTP URL namespace\n   model specified herein.\n\n5.1 HTTP URL Namespace Model\n\n   The HTTP URL namespace is a hierarchical namespace where the\n   hierarchy is delimited with the \"/\" character.\n\n   An HTTP URL namespace is said to be consistent if it meets the\n   following conditions: for every URL in the HTTP hierarchy there\n   exists a collection that contains that URL as an internal member.\n   The root, or top-level collection of the namespace under\n   consideration is exempt from the previous rule.\n\n   Neither HTTP/1.1 nor WebDAV require that the entire HTTP URL\n   namespace be consistent.  However, certain WebDAV methods are\n   prohibited from producing results that cause namespace\n   inconsistencies.\n\n   Although implicit in [RFC2068] and [RFC2396], any resource,\n   including collection resources, MAY be identified by more than one\n   URI. For example, a resource could be identified by multiple HTTP\n   URLs.\n\n5.2 Collection Resources\n\n   A collection is a resource whose state consists of at least a list\n   of internal member URIs and a set of properties, but which may have\n   additional state such as entity bodies returned by GET.  An internal\n   member URI MUST be immediately relative to a base URI of the\n   collection.  That is, the internal member URI is equal to a\n   containing collection's URI plus an additional segment for non-\n   collection resources, or additional segment plus trailing slash \"/\"\n   for collection resources, where segment is defined in section 3.3 of\n   [RFC2396].\n\n   Any given internal member URI MUST only belong to the collection\n   once, i.e., it is illegal to have multiple instances of the same URI\n   in a collection.  Properties defined on collections behave exactly\n   as do properties on non-collection resources.\n\n   For all WebDAV compliant resources A and B, identified by URIs U and\n   V, for which U is immediately relative to V, B MUST be a collection\n   that has U as an internal member URI. So, if the resource with URL\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 12]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   http://foo.com/bar/blah is WebDAV compliant and if the resource with\n   URL http://foo.com/bar/ is WebDAV compliant then the resource with\n   URL http://foo.com/bar/ must be a collection and must contain URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/blah as an internal member.\n\n   Collection resources MAY list the URLs ofnon-WebDAV compliant\n   children in the HTTP URL namespace hierarchy as internal members but\n   are not required to do so. For example, if the resource with URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/blah is not WebDAV compliant and the URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/ identifies a collection then URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/blah may or may not be an internal member of the\n   collection with URL http://foo.com/bar/.\n\n   If a WebDAV compliant resource has no WebDAV compliant children in\n   the HTTP URL namespace hierarchy then the WebDAV compliant resource\n   is not required to be a collection.\n\n   There is a standing convention that when a collection is referred to\n   by its name without a trailing slash, the trailing slash is\n   automatically appended.  Due to this, a resource may accept a URI\n   without a trailing \"/\" to point to a collection. In this case it\n   SHOULD return a content-location header in the response pointing to\n   the URI ending with the \"/\".  For example, if a client invokes a\n   method on http://foo.bar/blah (no trailing slash), the resource\n   http://foo.bar/blah/ (trailing slash) may respond as if the\n   operation were invoked on it, and should return a content-location\n   header with http://foo.bar/blah/ in it.  In general clients SHOULD\n   use the \"/\" form of collection names.\n\n   A resource MAY be a collection but not be WebDAV compliant.  That\n   is, the resource may comply with all the rules set out in this\n   specification regarding how a collection is to behave without\n   necessarily supporting all methods that a WebDAV compliant resource\n   is required to support.  In such a case the resource may return the\n   DAV:resourcetype property with the value DAV:collection but MUST NOT\n   return a DAV header containing the value \"1\" on an OPTIONS response.\n\n5.3 Creation and Retrieval of Collection Resources\n\n   This document specifies the MKCOL method to create new collection\n   resources, rather than using the existing HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST\n   method, for the following reasons:\n\n   In HTTP/1.1, the PUT method is defined to store the request body at\n   the location specified by the Request-URI.  While a description\n   format for a collection can readily be constructed for use with PUT,\n   the implications of sending such a description to the server are\n   undesirable.  For example, if a description of a collection that\n   omitted some existing resources were PUT to a server, this might be\n   interpreted as a command to remove those members.  This would extend\n   PUT to perform DELETE functionality, which is undesirable since it\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 13]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   changes the semantics of PUT, and makes it difficult to control\n   DELETE functionality with an access control scheme based on methods.\n\n   While the POST method is sufficiently open-ended that a \"create a\n   collection\" POST command could be constructed, this is undesirable\n   because it would be difficult to separate access control for\n   collection creation from other uses of POST.\n\n   The exact definition of the behavior of GET and PUT on collections\n   is defined later in this document.\n\n5.4 Source Resources and Output Resources\n\n   For many resources, the entity returned by a GET method exactly\n   matches the persistent state of the resource, for example, a GIF\n   file stored on a disk.  For this simple case, the URI at which a\n   resource is accessed is identical to the URI at which the source\n   (the persistent state) of the resource is accessed.  This is also\n   the case for HTML source files that are not processed by the server\n   prior to transmission.\n\n   However, the server can sometimes process HTML resources before they\n   are transmitted as a return entity body.  For example, a server-\n   side-include directive within an HTML file might instruct a server\n   to replace the directive with another value, such as the current\n   date.  In this case, what is returned by GET (HTML plus date)\n   differs from the persistent state of the resource (HTML plus\n   directive).  Typically there is no way to access the HTML resource\n   containing the unprocessed directive.\n\n   Sometimes the entity returned by GET is the output of a data-\n   producing process that is described by one or more source resources\n   (that may not even have a location in the URI namespace).  A single\n   data-producing process may dynamically generate the state of a\n   potentially large number of output resources.  An example of this is\n   a CGI script that describes a \"finger\" gateway process that maps\n   part of the namespace of a server into finger requests, such as\n   http://www.foo.bar.org/finger_gateway/user@host.\n\n   In the absence of distributed authoring capabilities, it is\n   acceptable to have no mapping of source resource(s) to the URI\n   namespace. In fact, preventing access to the source resource(s) has\n   desirable security benefits.  However, if remote editing of the\n   source resource(s) is desired, the source resource(s) should be\n   given a location in the URI namespace.  This source location should\n   not be one of the locations at which the generated output is\n   retrievable, since in general it is impossible for the server to\n   differentiate requests for source resources from requests for\n   process output resources.  There is often a many-to-many\n   relationship between source resources and output resources.\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 14]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   On WebDAV compliant servers the URI of the source resource(s) may be\n   stored in a link on the output resource with type DAV:source (see\n   section 13.10 for a description of the source link property).\n   Storing the source URIs in links on the output resources places the\n   burden of discovering the source on the authoring client.  Note that\n   the value of a source link is not guaranteed to point to the correct\n   source.  Source links may break or incorrect values may be entered.\n   Also note that not all servers will allow the client to set the\n   source link value.  For example a server which generates source\n   links on the fly for its CGI files will most likely not allow a\n   client to set the source link value.\n\n\n6  Locking\n\n   The ability to lock a resource provides a mechanism for serializing\n   access to that resource.  Using a lock, an authoring client can\n   provide a reasonable guarantee that another principal will not\n   modify a resource while it is being edited.  In this way, a client\n   can prevent the \"lost update\" problem.\n\n   This specification allows locks to vary over two client-specified\n   parameters, the number of principals involved (exclusive vs. shared)\n   and the type of access to be granted. This document defines locking\n   for only one access type, write. However, the syntax is extensible,\n   and permits the eventual specification of locking for other access\n   types.\n\n6.1 Exclusive Vs. Shared Locks\n\n   The most basic form of lock is an exclusive lock.  This is a lock\n   where the access right in question is only granted to a single\n   principal.  The need for this arbitration results from a desire to\n   avoid having to merge results.\n\n   However, there are times when the goal of a lock is not to exclude\n   others from exercising an access right but rather to provide a\n   mechanism for principals to indicate that they intend to exercise\n   their access rights.  Shared locks are provided for this case.  A\n   shared lock allows multiple principals to receive a lock.  Hence any\n   principal with appropriate access can get the lock.\n\n   With shared locks there are two trust sets that affect a resource.\n   The first trust set is created by access permissions.  Principals\n   who are trusted, for example, may have permission to write to the\n   resource.  Among those who have access permission to write to the\n   resource, the set of principals who have taken out a shared lock\n   also must trust each other, creating a (typically) smaller trust set\n   within the access permission write set.\n\n   Starting with every possible principal on the Internet, in most\n   situations the vast majority of these principals will not have write\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 15]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   access to a given resource.  Of the small number who do have write\n   access, some principals may decide to guarantee their edits are free\n   from overwrite conflicts by using exclusive write locks.  Others may\n   decide they trust their collaborators will not overwrite their work\n   (the potential set of collaborators being the set of principals who\n   have write permission) and use a shared lock, which informs their\n   collaborators that a principal may be working on the resource.\n\n   The WebDAV extensions to HTTP do not need to provide all of the\n   communications paths necessary for principals to coordinate their\n   activities.  When using shared locks, principals may use any out of\n   band communication channel to coordinate their work (e.g., face-to-\n   face interaction, written notes, post-it notes on the screen,\n   telephone conversation, Email, etc.)  The intent of a shared lock is\n   to let collaborators know who else may be working on a resource.\n\n   Shared locks are included because experience from web distributed\n   authoring systems has indicated that exclusive locks are often too\n   rigid.  An exclusive lock is used to enforce a particular editing\n   process: take out an exclusive lock, read the resource, perform\n   edits, write the resource, release the lock.  This editing process\n   has the problem that locks are not always properly released, for\n   example when a program crashes, or when a lock owner leaves without\n   unlocking a resource.  While both timeouts and administrative action\n   can be used to remove an offending lock, neither mechanism may be\n   available when needed; the timeout may be long or the administrator\n   may not be available.\n\n6.2 Required Support\n\n   A WebDAV compliant server is not required to support locking in any\n   form.  If the server does support locking it may choose to support\n   any combination of exclusive and shared locks for any access types.\n\n   The reason for this flexibility is that locking policy strikes to\n   the very heart of the resource management and versioning systems\n   employed by various storage repositories.  These repositories\n   require control over what sort of locking will be made available.\n   For example, some repositories only support shared write locks while\n   others only provide support for exclusive write locks while yet\n   others use no locking at all.  As each system is sufficiently\n   different to merit exclusion of certain locking features, this\n   specification leaves locking as the sole axis of negotiation within\n   WebDAV.\n\n6.3 Lock Tokens\n\n   A lock token is a type of state token, represented as a URI, which\n   identifies a particular lock.  A lock token is returned by every\n   successful LOCK operation in the lockdiscovery property in the\n   response body, and can also be found through lock discovery on a\n   resource.\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 16]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n\n   Lock token URIs MUST be unique across all resources for all time.\n   This uniqueness constraint allows lock tokens to be submitted across\n   resources and servers without fear of confusion.\n\n   This specification provides a lock token URI scheme called\n   opaquelocktoken that meets the uniqueness requirements.  However\n   resources are free to return any URI scheme so long as it meets the\n   uniqueness requirements.\n\n   Having a lock token provides no special access rights. Anyone can\n   find out anyone else's lock token by performing lock discovery.\n   Locks MUST be enforced based upon whatever authentication mechanism\n   is used by the server, not based on the secrecy of the token values.\n\n6.4 opaquelocktoken Lock Token URI Scheme\n\n   The opaquelocktoken URI scheme is designed to be unique across all\n   resources for all time.  Due to this uniqueness quality, a client\n   may submit an opaque lock token in an If header on a resource other\n   than the one that returned it.\n\n   All resources MUST recognize the opaquelocktoken scheme and, at\n   minimum, recognize that the lock token does not refer to an\n   outstanding lock on the resource.\n\n   In order to guarantee uniqueness across all resources for all time\n   the opaquelocktoken requires the use of the Universal Unique\n   Identifier (UUID) mechanism, as described in [ISO-11578].\n\n   Opaquelocktoken generators, however, have a choice of how they\n   create these tokens.  They can either generate a new UUID for every\n   lock token they create or they can create a single UUID  and then\n   add extension characters.  If the second method is selected then the\n   program generating the extensions MUST guarantee that the same\n   extension will never be used twice with the associated UUID.\n\n   OpaqueLockToken-URI = \"opaquelocktoken:\" UUID [Extension]  ; The\n   UUID production is the string representation of a UUID, as defined\n   in [ISO-11578]. Note that white space (LWS) is not allowed between\n   elements of this production.\n\n   Extension = path  ; path is defined in section 3.2.1 of RFC 2068\n   [RFC2068]\n\n6.4.1     Node Field Generation Without the IEEE 802 Address\n\n   UUIDs, as defined in [ISO-11578], contain a \"node\" field that\n   contains one of the IEEE 802 addresses for the server machine.  As\n   noted in section 17.8, there are several security risks associated\n   with exposing a machine's IEEE 802 address. This section provides an\n   alternate mechanism for generating the \"node\" field of a UUID which\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 17]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   does not employ an IEEE 802 address.  WebDAV servers MAY use this\n   algorithm for creating the node field when generating UUIDs.  The\n   text in this section isoriginally from an Internet-Draft by Paul\n   Leach and Rich Salz, who are noted here to properly attribute their\n   work.\n\n   The ideal solution is to obtain a 47 bit cryptographic quality\n   random number, and use it as the low 47 bits of the node ID, with\n   the most significant bit of the first octet of the node ID set to 1.\n   This bit is the unicast/multicast bit, which will never be set in\n   IEEE 802 addresses obtained from network cards; hence, there can\n   never be a conflict between UUIDs generated by machines with and\n   without network cards.\n\n   If a system does not have a primitive to generate cryptographic\n   quality random numbers, then in most systems there are usually a\n   fairly large number of sources of randomness available from which\n   one can be generated. Such sources are system specific, but often\n   include:\n\n     - the percent of memory in use\n     - the size of main memory in bytes\n     - the amount of free main memory in bytes\n     - the size of the paging or swap file in bytes\n     - free bytes of paging or swap file\n     - the total size of user virtual address space in bytes\n     - the total available user address space bytes\n     - the size of boot disk drive in bytes\n     - the free disk space on boot drive in bytes\n     - the current time\n     - the amount of time since the system booted\n     - the individual sizes of files in various system directories\n     - the creation, last read, and modification times of files in\n       various system directories\n     - the utilization factors of various system resources (heap, etc.)\n     - current mouse cursor position\n     - current caret position\n     - current number of running processes, threads\n     - handles or IDs of the desktop window and the active window\n     - the value of stack pointer of the caller\n     - the process and thread ID of caller\n     - various processor architecture specific performance counters\n       (instructions executed, cache misses, TLB misses)\n\n   (Note that it is precisely the above kinds of sources of randomness\n   that are used to seed cryptographic quality random number generators\n   on systems without special hardware for their construction.)\n\n   In addition, items such as the computer's name and the name of the\n   operating system, while not strictly speaking random, will help\n   differentiate the results from those obtained by other systems.\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 18]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   The exact algorithm to generate a node ID using these data is system\n   specific, because both the data available and the functions to\n   obtain them are often very system specific. However, assuming that\n   one can concatenate all the values from the randomness sources into\n   a buffer, and that a cryptographic hash function such as MD5 is\n   available, then any 6 bytes of the MD5 hash of the buffer, with the\n   multicast bit (the high bit of the first byte) set will be an\n   appropriately random node ID.\n\n   Other hash functions, such as SHA-1, can also be used. The only\n   requirement is that the result be suitably random _ in the sense\n   that the outputs from a set uniformly distributed inputs are\n   themselves uniformly distributed, and that a single bit change in\n   the input can be expected to cause half of the output bits to\n   change.\n\n6.5 Lock Capability Discovery\n\n   Since server lock support is optional, a client trying to lock a\n   resource on a server can either try the lock and hope for the best,\n   or perform some form of discovery to determine what lock\n   capabilities the server supports.  This is known as lock capability\n   discovery.  Lock capability discovery differs from discovery of\n   supported access control types, since there may be access control\n   types without corresponding lock types.  A client can determine what\n   lock types the server supports by retrieving the supportedlock\n   property.\n\n   Any DAV compliant resource that supports the LOCK method MUST\n   support the supportedlock property.\n\n6.6 Active Lock Discovery\n\n   If another principal locks a resource that a principal wishes to\n   access, it is useful for the second principal to be able to find out\n   who the first principal is.  For this purpose the lockdiscovery\n   property is provided.  This property lists all outstanding locks,\n   describes their type, and where available, provides their lock\n   token.\n\n   Any DAV compliant resource that supports the LOCK method MUST\n   support the lockdiscovery property.\n\n6.7 Usage Considerations\n\n   Although the locking mechanisms specified here provide some help in\n   preventing lost updates, they cannot guarantee that updates will\n   never be lost.  Consider the following scenario:\n\n   Two clients A and B are interested in editing the resource\n   'index.html'.  Client A is an HTTP client rather than a WebDAV\n   client, and so does not know how to perform locking.\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 19]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n\n   Client A doesn't lock the document, but does a GET and begins\n   editing.\n   Client B does LOCK, performs a GET and begins editing.\n   Client B finishes editing, performs a PUT, then an UNLOCK.\n   Client A performs a PUT, overwriting and losing all of B's changes.\n\n   There are several reasons why the WebDAV protocol itself cannot\n   prevent this situation.  First, it cannot force all clients to use\n   locking because it must be compatible with HTTP clients that do not\n   comprehend locking.  Second, it cannot require servers to support\n   locking because of the variety of repository implementations, some\n   of which rely on reservations and merging rather than on locking.\n   Finally, being stateless, it cannot enforce a sequence of operations\n   like LOCK / GET / PUT / UNLOCK.\n\n   WebDAV servers that support locking can reduce the likelihood that\n   clients will accidentally overwrite each other's changes by\n   requiring clients to lock resources before modifying them.  Such\n   servers would effectively prevent HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 clients from\n   modifying resources.\n\n   WebDAV clients can be good citizens by using a lock / retrieve /\n   write /unlock sequence of operations (at least by default) whenever\n   they interact with a WebDAV server that supports locking.\n\n   HTTP 1.1 clients can be good citizens, avoiding overwriting other\n   clients' changes, by using entity tags in If-Match headers with any\n   requests that would modify resources.\n\n   Information managers may attempt to prevent overwrites by\n   implementing client-side procedures requiring locking before\n   modifying WebDAV resources.\n\n\n7  Write Lock\n\n   This section describes the semantics specific to the write lock\n   type.  The write lock is a specific instance of a lock type, and is\n   the only lock type described in this specification.\n\n7.1 Methods Restricted by Write Locks\n\n   A write lock MUST prevent a principal without the lock from\n   successfully executing a PUT, POST, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, MOVE,\n   DELETE, or MKCOL on the locked resource.  All other current methods,\n   GET in particular, function independently of the lock.\n\n   Note, however, that as new methods are created it will be necessary\n   to specify how they interact with a write lock.\n\n\n\nGoland et al.

Thus if five principals have a shared write\n   lock on the same resource there will be five lock tokens, one for\n   each principal.\n\n7.3 Write Locks and Properties\n\n   While those without a write lock may not alter a property on a\n   resource it is still possible for the values of live properties to\n   change, even while locked, due to the requirements of their schemas.\n   Only dead properties and live properties defined to respect locks\n   are guaranteed not to change while write locked.\n\n7.4 Write Locks and Null Resources\n\n   It is possible to assert a write lock on a null resource in order to\n   lock the name.\n\n   A write locked null resource, referred to as a lock-null resource,\n   MUST respond with a 404 (Not Found) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) to\n   any HTTP/1.1 or DAV methods except for PUT, MKCOL, OPTIONS,\n   PROPFIND, LOCK, and UNLOCK.  A lock-null resource MUST appear as a\n   member of its parent collection.  Additionally the lock-null\n   resource MUST have defined on it all mandatory DAV properties.  Most\n   of these properties, such as all the get* properties, will have no\n   value as a lock-null resource does not support the GET method.\n   Lock-Null resources MUST have defined values for lockdiscovery and\n   supportedlock properties.\n\n   Until a method such as PUT or MKCOL is successfully executed on the\n   lock-null resource the resource MUST stay in the lock-null state.\n   However, once a PUT or MKCOL is successfully executed on a lock-null\n   resource the resource ceases to be in the lock-null state.\n\n   If the resource is unlocked, for any reason, without a PUT, MKCOL,\n   or similar method having been successfully executed upon it then the\n   resource MUST return to the null state.\n\n7.5 Write Locks and Collections\n\n   A write lock on a collection, whether created by a \"Depth: 0\" or\n   \"Depth: infinity\" lock request, prevents the addition or removal of\n   member URIs of the collection by non-lock owners.  As a consequence,\n   when a principal issues a PUT or POST request to create a new\n   resource under a URI which needs to be an internal member of a write\n   locked collection to maintain HTTP namespace consistency, or issues\n   a DELETE to remove a resource which has a URI which is an existing\n   internal member URI of a write locked collection, this request MUST\n   fail if the principal does not have a write lock on the collection.\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 21]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n\n   However, if a write lock request is issued to a collection\n   containing member URIs identifying resources that are currently\n   locked in a manner which conflicts with the write lock, the request\n   MUST fail with a 423 (Locked) status code.\n\n   If a lock owner causes the URI of a resource to be added as an\n   internal member URI of a locked collection then the new resource\n   MUST be automatically added to the lock.  This is the only mechanism\n   that allows a resource to be added to a write lock.  Thus, for\n   example, if the collection /a/b/ is write locked and the resource /c\n   is moved to /a/b/c then resource /a/b/c will be added to the write\n   lock.\n\n7.6 Write Locks and the If Request Header\n\n   If a user agent is not required to have knowledge about a lock when\n   requesting an operation on a locked resource, the following scenario\n   might occur.  Program A, run by User A, takes out a write lock on a\n   resource.  Program B, also run by User A, has no knowledge of the\n   lock taken out by Program A, yet performs a PUT to the locked\n   resource.  In this scenario, the PUT succeeds because locks are\n   associated with a principal, not a program, and thus program B,\n   because it is acting with principal A's credential, is allowed to\n   perform the PUT.  However, had program B known about the lock, it\n   would not have overwritten the resource, preferring instead to\n   present a dialog box describing the conflict to the user.  Due to\n   this scenario, a mechanism is needed to prevent different programs\n   from accidentally ignoring locks taken out by other programs with\n   the same authorization.\n\n   In order to prevent these collisions a lock token MUST be submitted\n   by an authorized principal in the If header for all locked resources\n   that a method may interact with or the method MUST fail.  For\n   example, if a resource is to be moved and both the source and\n   destination are locked then two lock tokens must be submitted, one\n   for the source and the other for the destination.\n\n7.6.1     Example - Write Lock\n\n   >>Request\n\n   COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.ics.uci.edu\n   Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html\n   If: <http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html>\n       (<opaquelocktoken:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>)\n\n\n   >>Response\n\n   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 22]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n\n\n   In this example, even though both the source and destination are\n   locked, only one lock token must be submitted, for the lock on the\n   destination.  This is because the source resource is not modified by\n   a COPY, and hence unaffected by the write lock. In this example,\n   user agent authentication has previously occurred via a mechanism\n   outside the scope of the HTTP protocol, in the underlying transport\n   layer.\n\n7.7 Write Locks and COPY/MOVE\n\n   A COPY method invocation MUST NOT duplicate any write locks active\n   on the source.  However, as previously noted, if the COPY copies the\n   resource into a collection that is locked with \"Depth: infinity\",\n   then the resource will be added to the lock.\n\n   A successful MOVE request on a write locked resource MUST NOT move\n   the write lock with the resource. However, the resource is subject\n   to being added to an existing lock at the destination, as specified\n   in section 7.5. For example, if the MOVE makes the resource a child\n   of a collection that is locked with \"Depth: infinity\", then the\n   resource will be added to that collection's lock. Additionally, if a\n   resource locked with \"Depth: infinity\" is moved to a destination\n   that is within the scope of the same lock (e.g., within the\n   namespace tree covered by the lock), the moved resource will again\n   be a added to the lock. In both these examples, as specified in\n   section 7.6, an If header must be submitted containing a lock token\n   for both the source and destination.\n\n7.8 Refreshing Write Locks\n\n   A client MUST NOT submit the same write lock request twice.  Note\n   that a client is always aware it is resubmitting the same lock\n   request because it must include the lock token in the If header in\n   order to make the request for a resource that is already locked.\n\n   However, a client may submit a LOCK method with an If header but\n   without a body.  This form of LOCK MUST only be used to \"refresh\" a\n   lock.  Meaning, at minimum, that any timers associated with the lock\n   MUST be re-set.\n\n   A server may return a Timeout header with a lock refresh that is\n   different than the Timeout header returned when the lock was\n   originally requested.  Additionally clients may submit Timeout\n   headers of arbitrary value with their lock refresh requests.\n   Servers, as always, may ignore Timeout headers submitted by the\n   client.\n\n   If an error is received in response to a refresh LOCK request the\n   client SHOULD assume that the lock was not refreshed.\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 23]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n8  HTTP Methods for Distributed Authoring\n\n   The following new HTTP methods use XML as a request and response\n   format.  All DAV compliant clients and resources MUST use XML\n   parsers that are compliant with [REC-XML].  All XML used in either\n   requests or responses MUST be, at minimum, well formed.  If a server\n   receives ill-formed XML in a request it MUST reject the entire\n   request with a 400 (Bad Request).  If a client receives ill-formed\n   XML in a response then it MUST NOT assume anything about the outcome\n   of the executed method and SHOULD treat the server as\n   malfunctioning.\n\n8.1 PROPFIND\n\n   The PROPFIND method retrieves properties defined on the resource\n   identified by the Request-URI, if the resource does not have any\n   internal members, or on the resource identified by the Request-URI\n   and potentially its member resources, if the resource is a\n   collection that has internal member URIs.  All DAV compliant\n   resources MUST support the PROPFIND method and the propfind XML\n   element (section 12.14) along with all XML elements defined for use\n   with that element.\n\n   A client may submit a Depth header with a value of \"0\", \"1\", or\n   \"infinity\" with a PROPFIND on a collection resource with internal\n   member URIs.  DAV compliant servers MUST support the \"0\", \"1\" and\n   \"infinity\" behaviors. By default, the PROPFIND method without a\n   Depth header MUST act as if a \"Depth: infinity\" header was included.\n\n   A client may submit a propfind XML element in the body of the\n   request method describing what information is being requested.  It\n   is possible to request particular property values, all property\n   values, or a list of the names of the resource's properties.  A\n   client may choose not to submit a request body.  An empty PROPFIND\n   request body MUST be treated as a request for the names and values\n   of all properties.\n\n   All servers MUST support returning a response of content type\n   text/xml or application/xml that contains a multistatus XML element\n   that describes the results of the attempts to retrieve the various\n   properties.\n\n   If there is an error retrieving a property then a proper error\n   result MUST be included in the response.  A request to retrieve the\n   value of a property which does not exist is an error and MUST be\n   noted, if the response uses a multistatus XML element, with a\n   response XML element which contains a 404 (Not Found) status value.\n\n   Consequently, the multistatus XML element for a collection resource\n   with member URIs MUST include a response XML element for each member\n   URI of the collection, to whatever depth was requested. Each\n   response XML element MUST contain an href XML element that gives the\n\nGoland et al.

Results for a PROPFIND on a collection resource with\n   internal member URIs are returned as a flat list whose order of\n   entries is not significant.\n\n   In the case of allprop and propname, if a principal does not have\n   the right to know whether a particular property exists then the\n   property should be silently excluded from the response.\n\n   The results of this method SHOULD NOT be cached.\n\n8.1.1     Example - Retrieving Named Properties\n\n   >>Request\n\n   PROPFIND  /file HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.foo.bar\n   Content-type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\n   Content-Length: xxxx\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n     <D:prop xmlns:R=\"http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/\">\n          <R:bigbox/>\n          <R:author/>\n          <R:DingALing/>\n          <R:Random/>\n     </D:prop>\n   </D:propfind>\n\n   >>Response\n\n   HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status\n   Content-Type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\n   Content-Length: xxxx\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:multistatus xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n     <D:response>\n          <D:href>http://www.foo.bar/file</D:href>\n          <D:propstat>\n               <D:prop xmlns:R=\"http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/\">\n                    <R:bigbox>\n                         <R:BoxType>Box type A</R:BoxType>\n                    </R:bigbox>\n                    <R:author>\n                         <R:Name>J.J.

Since no Depth header is present, it\n   assumes its default value of \"infinity\", meaning the name of the\n   properties on the collection and all its progeny should be returned.\n\n   Consistent with the previous example, resource\n   http://www.foo.bar/container/ has six properties defined on it,\n   http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/bigbox,\n   http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/author, DAV:creationdate,\n   DAV:displayname, DAV:resourcetype, and DAV:supportedlock.\n\n   The resource http://www.foo.bar/container/index.html, a member of\n   the \"container\" collection, has nine properties defined on it,\n   http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/bigbox, DAV:creationdate,\n   DAV:displayname, DAV:getcontentlength, DAV:getcontenttype,\n   DAV:getetag, DAV:getlastmodified, DAV:resourcetype, and\n   DAV:supportedlock.\n\n   This example also demonstrates the use of XML namespace scoping, and\n   the default namespace.  Since the \"xmlns\" attibute does not contain\n   an explicit \"shorthand name\" (prefix) letter, the namespace applies\n   by default to all enclosed elements.  Hence, all elements which do\n   not explicitly state the namespace to which they belong are members\n   of the \"DAV:\" namespace schema.\n\n8.2 PROPPATCH\n\n   The PROPPATCH method processes instructions specified in the request\n   body to set and/or remove properties defined on the resource\n   identified by the Request-URI.\n\n   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the PROPPATCH method and\n   MUST process instructions that are specified using the\n   propertyupdate, set, and remove XML elements of the DAV schema.\n   Execution of the directives in this method is, of course, subject to\n   access control constraints.  DAV compliant resources SHOULD support\n   the setting of arbitrary dead properties.\n\n   The request message body of a PROPPATCH method MUST contain the\n   propertyupdate XML element.  Instruction processing MUST occur in\n   the order instructions are received (i.e., from top to bottom).\n   Instructions MUST either all be executed or none executed. Thus if\n   any error occurs during processing all executed instructions MUST be\n   undone and a proper error result returned. Instruction processing\n   details can be found in the definition of the set and remove\n   instructions in section 12.13.\n\nGoland et al.

Note,\n   however, that unless explicitly prohibited any 2/3/4/5xx series\n   response code may be used in a 207 (Multi-Status) response.\n\n   200 (OK) - The command succeeded.  As there can be a mixture of sets\n   and removes in a body, a 201 (Created) seems inappropriate.\n\n   403 (Forbidden) - The client, for reasons the server chooses not to\n   specify, cannot alter one of the properties.\n\n   409 (Conflict) - The client has provided a value whose semantics are\n   not appropriate for the property.  This includes trying to set read-\n   only properties.\n\n   423 (Locked) - The specified resource is locked and the client\n   either is not a lock owner or the lock type requires a lock token to\n   be submitted and the client did not submit it.\n\n   507 (Insufficient Storage) - The server did not have sufficient\n   space to record the property.\n\n8.2.2     Example - PROPPATCH\n\n   >>Request\n\n   PROPPATCH /bar.html HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.foo.com\n   Content-Type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\n   Content-Length: xxxx\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propertyupdate xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"\n   xmlns:Z=\"http://www.w3.com/standards/z39.50/\">\n     <D:set>\n          <D:prop>\n               <Z:authors>\n                    <Z:Author>Jim Whitehead</Z:Author>\n                    <Z:Author>Roy Fielding</Z:Author>\n               </Z:authors>\n          </D:prop>\n     </D:set>\n     <D:remove>\n          <D:prop><Z:Copyright-Owner/></D:prop>\n     </D:remove>\n   </D:propertyupdate>\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.

Since the Copyright-Owner property could not be removed, no\n   property modifications occur.  The 424 (Failed Dependency) status\n   code for the Authors property indicates this action would have\n   succeeded if it were not for the conflict with removing the\n   Copyright-Owner property.\n\n8.3 MKCOL Method\n\n   The MKCOL method is used to create a new collection. All DAV\n   compliant resources MUST support the MKCOL method.\n\n8.3.1     Request\n\n   MKCOL creates a new collection resource at the location specified by\n   the Request-URI.  If the resource identified by the Request-URI is\n   non-null then the MKCOL MUST fail.  During MKCOL processing, a\n   server MUST make the Request-URI a member of its parent collection,\n   unless the Request-URI is \"/\".  If no such ancestor exists, the\n   method MUST fail.  When the MKCOL operation creates a new collection\n   resource, all ancestors MUST already exist, or the method MUST fail\n   with a 409 (Conflict) status code.  For example, if a request to\n   create collection /a/b/c/d/ is made, and neither /a/b/ nor /a/b/c/\n   exists, the request must fail.\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 32]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   When MKCOL is invoked without a request body, the newly created\n   collection SHOULD have no members.\n\n   A MKCOL request message may contain a message body.  The behavior of\n   a MKCOL request when the body is present is limited to creating\n   collections, members of a collection, bodies of members and\n   properties on the collections or members.  If the server receives a\n   MKCOL request entity type it does not support or understand it MUST\n   respond with a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status code.  The exact\n   behavior of MKCOL for various request media types is undefined in\n   this document, and will be specified in separate documents.\n\n8.3.2     Status Codes\n\n   Responses from a MKCOL request MUST NOT be cached as MKCOL has non-\n   idempotent semantics.\n\n   201 (Created) - The collection or structured resource was created in\n   its entirety.\n\n   403 (Forbidden) - This indicates at least one of two conditions: 1)\n   the server does not allow the creation of collections at the given\n   location in its namespace, or 2) the parent collection of the\n   Request-URI exists but cannot accept members.\n\n   405 (Method Not Allowed) - MKCOL can only be executed on a\n   deleted/non-existent resource.\n\n   409 (Conflict) - A collection cannot be made at the Request-URI\n   until one or more intermediate collections have been created.\n\n   415 (Unsupported Media Type)- The server does not support the\n   request type of the body.\n\n   507 (Insufficient Storage) - The resource does not have sufficient\n   space to record the state of the resource after the execution of\n   this method.\n\n8.3.3     Example - MKCOL\n\n   This example creates a collection called /webdisc/xfiles/ on the\n   server www.server.org.\n\n   >>Request\n\n   MKCOL /webdisc/xfiles/ HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.server.org\n\n   >>Response\n\n   HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 33]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n\n8.4 GET, HEAD for Collections\n\n   The semantics of GET are unchanged when applied to a collection,\n   since GET is defined as, \"retrieve whatever information (in the form\n   of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI\" [RFC2068].  GET when\n   applied to a collection may return the contents of an \"index.html\"\n   resource, a human-readable view of the contents of the collection,\n   or something else altogether. Hence it is possible that the result\n   of a GET on a collection will bear no correlation to the membership\n   of the collection.\n\n   Similarly, since the definition of HEAD is a GET without a response\n   message body, the semantics of HEAD are unmodified when applied to\n   collection resources.\n\n8.5 POST for Collections\n\n   Since by definition the actual function performed by POST is\n   determined by the server and often depends on the particular\n   resource, the behavior of POST when applied to collections cannot be\n   meaningfully modified because it is largely undefined.  Thus the\n   semantics of POST are unmodified when applied to a collection.\n\n8.6 DELETE\n\n8.6.1     DELETE for Non-Collection Resources\n\n   If the DELETE method is issued to a non-collection resource whose\n   URIs are an internal member of one or more collections, then during\n   DELETE processing a server MUST remove any URI for the resource\n   identified by the Request-URI from collections which contain it as a\n   member.\n\n8.6.2     DELETE for Collections\n\n   The DELETE method on a collection MUST act as if a \"Depth: infinity\"\n   header was used on it.  A client MUST NOT submit a Depth header with\n   a DELETE on a collection with any value but infinity.\n\n   DELETE instructs that the collection specified in the Request-URI\n   and all resources identified by its internal member URIs are to be\n   deleted.\n\n   If any resource identified by a member URI cannot be deleted then\n   all of the member's ancestors MUST NOT be deleted, so as to maintain\n   namespace consistency.\n\n   Any headers included with DELETE MUST be applied in processing every\n   resource to be deleted.\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 34]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   When the DELETE method has completed processing it MUST result in a\n   consistent namespace.\n\n   If an error occurs with a resource other than the resource\n   identified in the Request-URI then the response MUST be a 207\n   (Multi-Status).  424 (Failed Dependency) errors SHOULD NOT be in the\n   207 (Multi-Status).  They can be safely left out because the client\n   will know that the ancestors of a resource could not be deleted when\n   the client receives an error for the ancestor's progeny.\n   Additionally 204 (No Content) errors SHOULD NOT be returned in the\n   207 (Multi-Status).  The reason for this prohibition is that 204 (No\n   Content) is the default success code.\n\n8.6.2.1   Example - DELETE\n\n   >>Request\n\n   DELETE  /container/ HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.foo.bar\n\n   >>Response\n\n   HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status\n   Content-Type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\n   Content-Length: xxxx\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <d:multistatus xmlns:d=\"DAV:\">\n     <d:response>\n          <d:href>http://www.foo.bar/container/resource3</d:href>\n          <d:status>HTTP/1.1 423 Locked</d:status>\n     </d:response>\n   </d:multistatus>\n\n   In this example the attempt to delete\n   http://www.foo.bar/container/resource3 failed because it is locked,\n   and no lock token was submitted with the request. Consequently, the\n   attempt to delete http://www.foo.bar/container/ also failed. Thus\n   the client knows that the attempt to delete\n   http://www.foo.bar/container/ must have also failed since the parent\n   can not be deleted unless its child has also been deleted.  Even\n   though a Depth header has not been included, a depth of infinity is\n   assumed because the method is on a collection.\n\n8.7 PUT\n\n8.7.1     PUT for Non-Collection Resources\n\n   A PUT performed on an existing resource replaces the GET response\n   entity of the resource.  Properties defined on the resource may be\n   recomputed during PUT processing but are not otherwise affected.\n   For example, if a server recognizes the content type of the request\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 35]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   body, it may be able to automatically extract information that could\n   be profitably exposed as properties.\n\n   A PUT that would result in the creation of a resource without an\n   appropriately scoped parent collection MUST fail with a 409\n   (Conflict).\n\n8.7.2     PUT for Collections\n\n   As defined in the HTTP/1.1 specification [RFC2068], the \"PUT method\n   requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied\n   Request-URI.\"  Since submission of an entity representing a\n   collection would implicitly encode creation and deletion of\n   resources, this specification intentionally does not define a\n   transmission format for creating a collection using PUT.  Instead,\n   the MKCOL method is defined to create collections.\n\n   When the PUT operation creates a new non-collection resource all\n   ancestors MUST already exist.  If all ancestors do not exist, the\n   method MUST fail with a 409 (Conflict) status code.  For example, if\n   resource /a/b/c/d.html is to be created and /a/b/c/ does not exist,\n   then the request must fail.\n\n8.8 COPY Method\n\n   The COPY method creates a duplicate of the source resource,\n   identified by the Request-URI, in the destination resource,\n   identified by the URI in the Destination header.  The Destination\n   header MUST be present.  The exact behavior of the COPY method\n   depends on the type of the source resource.\n\n   All WebDAV compliant resources MUST support the COPY method.\n   However, support for the COPY method does not guarantee the ability\n   to copy a resource. For example, separate programs may control\n   resources on the same server.  As a result, it may not be possible\n   to copy a resource to a location that appears to be on the same\n   server.\n\n8.8.1     COPY for HTTP/1.1 resources\n\n   When the source resource is not a collection the result of the COPY\n   method is the creation of a new resource at the destination whose\n   state and behavior match that of the source resource as closely as\n   possible.  After a successful COPY invocation, all properties on the\n   source resource MUST be duplicated on the destination resource,\n   subject to modifying headers and XML elements, following the\n   definition for copying properties.  Since the environment at the\n   destination may be different than at the source due to factors\n   outside the scope of control of the server, such as the absence of\n   resources required for correct operation, it may not be possible to\n   completely duplicate the behavior of the resource at the\n   destination. Subsequent alterations to the destination resource will\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 36]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n   not modify the source resource.  Subsequent alterations to the\n   source resource will not modify the destination resource.\n\n8.8.2     COPY for Properties\n\n   The following section defines how properties on a resource are\n   handled during a COPY operation.\n\n   Live properties SHOULD be duplicated as identically behaving live\n   properties at the destination resource.  If a property cannot be\n   copied live, then its value MUST be duplicated, octet-for-octet, in\n   an identically named, dead property on the destination resource\n   subject to the effects of the propertybehavior XML element.\n\n   The propertybehavior XML element can specify that properties are\n   copied on best effort, that all live properties must be successfully\n   copied or the method must fail, or that a specified list of live\n   properties must be successfully copied or the method must fail.

A client may\n   submit a Depth header on a COPY on a collection with a value of \"0\"\n   or \"infinity\".  DAV compliant servers MUST support the \"0\" and\n   \"infinity\" Depth header behaviors.\n\n   A COPY of depth infinity instructs that the collection resource\n   identified by the Request-URI is to be copied to the location\n   identified by the URI in the Destination header, and all its\n   internal member resources are to be copied to a location relative to\n   it, recursively through all levels of the collection hierarchy.\n\n   A COPY of \"Depth: 0\" only instructs that the collection and its\n   properties but not resources identified by its internal member URIs,\n   are to be copied.\n\n   Any headers included with a COPY MUST be applied in processing every\n   resource to be copied with the exception of the Destination header.\n\n   The Destination header only specifies the destination URI for the\n   Request-URI. When applied to members of the collection identified by\n   the Request-URI the value of Destination is to be modified to\n   reflect the current location in the hierarchy.  So, if the Request-\n   URI is /a/ with Host header value http://fun.com/ and the\n   Destination is http://fun.com/b/ then when http://fun.com/a/c/d is\n   processed it must use a Destination of http://fun.com/b/c/d.\n\n   When the COPY method has completed processing it MUST have created a\n   consistent namespace at the destination (see section 5.1 for the\n   definition of namespace consistency).  However, if an error occurs\n\n\nGoland et al.

After detecting an error, the COPY operation SHOULD try\n   to finish as much of the original copy operation as possible (i.e.,\n   the server should still attempt to copy other subtrees and their\n   members, that are not descendents of an error-causing collection).\n   So, for example, if an infinite depth copy operation is performed on\n   collection /a/, which contains collections /a/b/ and /a/c/, and an\n   error occurs copying /a/b/, an attempt should still be made to copy\n   /a/c/. Similarly, after encountering an error copying a non-\n   collection resource as part of an infinite depth copy, the server\n   SHOULD try to finish as much of the original copy operation as\n   possible.\n\n   If an error in executing the COPY method occurs with a resource\n   other than the resource identified in the Request-URI then the\n   response MUST be a 207 (Multi-Status).\n\n   The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code SHOULD NOT be returned in\n   the 207 (Multi-Status) response from a COPY method.  These responses\n   can be safely omitted because the client will know that the progeny\n   of a resource could not be copied when the client receives an error\n   for the parent.  Additionally 201 (Created)/204 (No Content) status\n   codes SHOULD NOT be returned as values in 207 (Multi-Status)\n   responses from COPY methods.

If the\n   Overwrite header is set to \"F\" then the operation will fail.\n\n8.8.5     Status Codes\n\n   201 (Created) - The source resource was successfully copied.

In this example most of the resources, along with the\n   collection, were copied successfully. However the collection R2\n   failed, most likely due to a problem with maintaining the liveness\n   of properties (this is specified by the propertybehavior XML\n   element).  Because there was an error copying R2, none of R2's\n   members were copied.  However no errors were listed for those\n   members due to the error minimization rules given in section 8.8.3.\n\n8.9 MOVE Method\n\n   The MOVE operation on a non-collection resource is the logical\n   equivalent of a copy (COPY), followed by consistency maintenance\n   processing, followed by a delete of the source, where all three\n   actions are performed atomically.  The consistency maintenance step\n   allows the server to perform updates caused by the move, such as\n   updating all URIs other than the Request-URI which identify the\n   source resource, to point to the new destination resource.\n   Consequently, the Destination header MUST be present on all MOVE\n   methods and MUST follow all COPY requirements for the COPY part of\n\n\nGoland et al.

However, support for the MOVE method does not guarantee the\n   ability to move a resource to a particular destination.\n\n   For example, separate programs may actually control different sets\n   of resources on the same server.  Therefore, it may not be possible\n   to move a resource within a namespace that appears to belong to the\n   same server.\n\n   If a resource exists at the destination, the destination resource\n   will be DELETEd as a side-effect of the MOVE operation, subject to\n   the restrictions of the Overwrite header.\n\n8.9.1     MOVE for Properties\n\n   The behavior of properties on a MOVE, including the effects of the\n   propertybehavior XML element, MUST be the same as specified in\n   section 8.8.2.\n\n8.9.2     MOVE for Collections\n\n   A MOVE with \"Depth: infinity\" instructs that the collection\n   identified by the Request-URI be moved to the URI specified in the\n   Destination header, and all resources identified by its internal\n   member URIs are to be moved to locations relative to it, recursively\n   through all levels of the collection hierarchy.\n\n   The MOVE method on a collection MUST act as if a \"Depth: infinity\"\n   header was used on it.  A client MUST NOT submit a Depth header on a\n   MOVE on a collection with any value but \"infinity\".\n\n   Any headers included with MOVE MUST be applied in processing every\n   resource to be moved with the exception of the Destination header.\n\n   The behavior of the Destination header is the same as given for COPY\n   on collections.\n\n   When the MOVE method has completed processing it MUST have created a\n   consistent namespace at both the source and destination (see section\n   5.1 for the definition of namespace consistency). However, if an\n   error occurs while moving an internal collection, the server MUST\n   NOT move any resources identified by members of the failed\n   collection (i.e., the server must skip the error-causing subtree),\n   as this would create an inconsistent namespace. In this case, after\n   detecting the error, the move operation SHOULD try to finish as much\n   of the original move as possible (i.e., the server should still\n   attempt to move other subtrees and the resources identified by their\n   members, that are not descendents of an error-causing collection).\n   So, for example, if an infinite depth move is performed on\n   collection /a/, which contains collections /a/b/ and /a/c/, and an\n   error occurs moving /a/b/, an attempt should still be made to try\n   moving /a/c/.

A lock token will need to be submitted for every\n   resource, both source and destination, anywhere in the scope of the\n   method, that is locked.  In this case the proper lock token was not\n   submitted for the destination http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/C2/.\n   This means that the resource /container/C2/ could not be moved.\n   Because there was an error copying /container/C2/, none of\n   /container/C2's members were copied.  However no errors were listed\n   for those members due to the error minimization rules given in\n   section 8.8.3.  User agent authentication has previously occurred\n   via a mechanism outside the scope of the HTTP protocol, in an\n   underlying transport layer.\n\n8.10 LOCK Method\n\n   The following sections describe the LOCK method, which is used to\n   take out a lock of any access type.  These sections on the LOCK\n   method describe only those semantics that are specific to the LOCK\n   method and are independent of the access type of the lock being\n   requested.\n\n   Any resource which supports the LOCK method MUST, at minimum,\n   support the XML request and response formats defined herein.\n\n8.10.1    Operation\n\n   A LOCK method invocation creates the lock specified by the lockinfo\n   XML element on the Request-URI.  Lock method requests SHOULD have a\n   XML request body which contains an owner XML element for this lock\n   request, unless this is a refresh request. The LOCK request may have\n   a Timeout header.\n\n   Clients MUST assume that locks may arbitrarily disappear at any\n   time, regardless of the value given in the Timeout header.  The\n   Timeout header only indicates the behavior of the server if\n   \"extraordinary\" circumstances do not occur.  For example, an\n   administrator may remove a lock at any time or the system may crash\n   in such a way that it loses the record of the lock's existence. The\n   response MUST contain the value of the lockdiscovery property in a\n   prop XML element.\n\n   In order to indicate the lock token associated with a newly created\n   lock, a Lock-Token response header MUST be included in the response\n   for every successful LOCK request for a new lock.  Note that the\n   Lock-Token header would not be returned in the response for a\n   successful refresh LOCK request because a new lock was not created.\n\n8.10.2    The Effect of Locks on Properties and Collections\n\n   The scope of a lock is the entire state of the resource, including\n   its body and associated properties.  As a result, a lock on a\n   resource MUST also lock the resource's properties.\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 44]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n\n   For collections, a lock also affects the ability to add or remove\n   members.  The nature of the effect depends upon the type of access\n   control involved.\n\n8.10.3    Locking Replicated Resources\n\n   A resource may be made available through more than one URI. However\n   locks apply to resources, not URIs. Therefore a LOCK request on a\n   resource MUST NOT succeed if can not be honored by all the URIs\n   through which the resource is addressable.\n\n8.10.4    Depth and Locking\n\n   The Depth header may be used with the LOCK method.  Values other\n   than 0 or infinity MUST NOT be used with the Depth header on a LOCK\n   method.  All resources that support the LOCK method MUST support the\n   Depth header.\n\n   A Depth header of value 0 means to just lock the resource specified\n   by the Request-URI.\n\n   If the Depth header is set to infinity then the resource specified\n   in the Request-URI along with all its internal members, all the way\n   down the hierarchy, are to be locked.  A successful result MUST\n   return a single lock token which represents all the resources that\n   have been locked.  If an UNLOCK is successfully executed on this\n   token, all associated resources are unlocked.  If the lock cannot be\n   granted to all resources, a 409 (Conflict) status code MUST be\n   returned with a response entity body containing a multistatus XML\n   element describing which resource(s) prevented the lock from being\n   granted.  Hence, partial success is not an option.  Either the\n   entire hierarchy is locked or no resources are locked.\n\n   If no Depth header is submitted on a LOCK request then the request\n   MUST act as if a \"Depth:infinity\" had been submitted.\n\n8.10.5    Interaction with other Methods\n\n   The interaction of a LOCK with various methods is dependent upon the\n   lock type.  However, independent of lock type, a successful DELETE\n   of a resource MUST cause all of its locks to be removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.

In this request, the client has\n   specified that it desires an infinite length lock, if available,\n   otherwise a timeout of 4.1 billion seconds, if available. The\n   request entity body contains the contact information for the\n   principal taking out the lock, in this case a web page URL.\n\n   The error is a 403 (Forbidden) response on the resource\n   http://webdav.sb.aol.com/webdav/secret.  Because this resource could\n   not be locked, none of the resources were locked.  Note also that\n   the lockdiscovery property for the Request-URI has been included as\n   required.  In this example the lockdiscovery property is empty which\n   means that there are no outstanding locks on the resource.\n\n   In this example, the nonce, response, and opaque fields have not\n   been calculated in the Authorization request header.\n\n8.11 UNLOCK Method\n\n   The UNLOCK method removes the lock identified by the lock token in\n   the Lock-Token request header from the Request-URI, and all other\n   resources included in the lock.  If all resources which have been\n   locked under the submitted lock token can not be unlocked then the\n   UNLOCK request MUST fail.\n\n   Any DAV compliant resource which supports the LOCK method MUST\n   support the UNLOCK method.\n\n8.11.1    Example - UNLOCK\n\n   >>Request\n\n   UNLOCK /workspace/webdav/info.doc HTTP/1.1\n   Host: webdav.sb.aol.com\n   Lock-Token: <opaquelocktoken:a515cfa4-5da4-22e1-f5b5-00a0451e6bf7>\n   Authorization: Digest username=\"ejw\",\n      realm=\"ejw@webdav.sb.aol.com\", nonce=\"...\",\n      uri=\"/workspace/webdav/proposal.doc\",\n      response=\"...\", opaque=\"...\"\n\n   >>Response\n\n   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n\n\n   In this example, the lock identified by the lock token\n   \"opaquelocktoken:a515cfa4-5da4-22e1-f5b5-00a0451e6bf7\" is\n   successfully removed from the resource\n   http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/info.doc.  If this lock\n   included more than just one resource, the lock is removed from all\n   resources included in the lock.

All DAV compliant resources MUST return the\n   DAV header on all OPTIONS responses.\n\n   The value is a list of all compliance classes that the resource\n   supports.  Note that above a comma has already been added to the 2.\n   This is because a resource can not be level 2 compliant unless it is\n   also level 1 compliant. Please refer to section 15 for more details.\n   In general, however, support for one compliance class does not\n   entail support for any other.\n\n9.2 Depth Header\n\n   Depth = \"Depth\" \":\" (\"0\" | \"1\" | \"infinity\")\n\n   The Depth header is used with methods executed on resources which\n   could potentially have internal members to indicate whether the\n   method is to be applied only to the resource (\"Depth: 0\"), to the\n   resource and its immediate children, (\"Depth: 1\"), or the resource\n   and all its progeny (\"Depth: infinity\").\n\n   The Depth header is only supported if a method's definition\n   explicitly provides for such support.\n\n   The following rules are the default behavior for any method that\n   supports the Depth header. A method may override these defaults by\n   defining different behavior in its definition.\n\n   Methods which support the Depth header may choose not to support all\n   of the header's values and may define, on a case by case basis, the\n   behavior of the method if a Depth header is not present. For\n   example, the MOVE method only supports \"Depth: infinity\" and if a\n   Depth header is not present will act as if a \"Depth: infinity\"\n   header had been applied.\n\n   Clients MUST NOT rely upon methods executing on members of their\n   hierarchies in any particular order or on the execution being atomic\n   unless the particular method explicitly provides such guarantees.\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 51]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   Upon execution, a method with a Depth header will perform as much of\n   its assigned task as possible and then return a response specifying\n   what it was able to accomplish and what it failed to do.\n\n   So, for example, an attempt to COPY a hierarchy may result in some\n   of the members being copied and some not.\n\n   Any headers on a method that has a defined interaction with the\n   Depth header MUST be applied to all resources in the scope of the\n   method except where alternative behavior is explicitly defined. For\n   example, an If-Match header will have its value applied against\n   every resource in the method's scope and will cause the method to\n   fail if the header fails to match.\n\n   If a resource, source or destination, within the scope of the method\n   with a Depth header is locked in such a way as to prevent the\n   successful execution of the method, then the lock token for that\n   resource MUST be submitted with the request in the If request\n   header.\n\n   The Depth header only specifies the behavior of the method with\n   regards to internal children.  If a resource does not have internal\n   children then the Depth header MUST be ignored.\n\n   Please note, however, that it is always an error to submit a value\n   for the Depth header that is not allowed by the method's definition.\n   Thus submitting a \"Depth: 1\" on a COPY, even if the resource does\n   not have internal members, will result in a 400 (Bad Request). The\n   method should fail not because the resource doesn't have internal\n   members, but because of the illegal value in the header.\n\n9.3 Destination Header\n\n   Destination = \"Destination\" \":\" absoluteURI\n\n   The Destination header specifies the URI which identifies a\n   destination resource for methods such as COPY and MOVE, which take\n   two URIs as parameters.  Note that the absoluteURI production is\n   defined in [RFC2396].\n\n9.4 If Header\n\n   If = \"If\" \":\" ( 1*No-tag-list | 1*Tagged-list)\n   No-tag-list = List\n   Tagged-list = Resource 1*List\n   Resource = Coded-URL\n   List = \"(\" 1*([\"Not\"](State-token | \"[\" entity-tag \"]\")) \")\"\n   State-token = Coded-URL\n   Coded-URL = \"<\" absoluteURI \">\"\n\n   The If header is intended to have similar functionality to the If-\n   Match header defined in section 14.25 of [RFC2068].

A typical example of a state token is a lock token, and\n   lock tokens are the only state tokens defined in this specification.\n\n   All DAV compliant resources MUST honor the If header.\n\n   The If header's purpose is to describe a series of state lists.  If\n   the state of the resource to which the header is applied does not\n   match any of the specified state lists then the request MUST fail\n   with a 412 (Precondition Failed).  If one of the described state\n   lists matches the state of the resource then the request may\n   succeed.\n\n   Note that the absoluteURI production is defined in [RFC2396].\n\n9.4.1     No-tag-list Production\n\n   The No-tag-list production describes a series of state tokens and\n   ETags.  If multiple No-tag-list productions are used then one only\n   needs to match the state of the resource for the method to be\n   allowed to continue.\n\n   If a method, due to the presence of a Depth or Destination header,\n   is applied to multiple resources then the No-tag-list production\n   MUST be applied to each resource the method is applied to.\n\n9.4.1.1   Example - No-tag-list If Header\n\n   If: (<locktoken:a-write-lock-token> [\"I am an ETag\"]) ([\"I am\n   another ETag\"])\n\n   The previous header would require that any resources within the\n   scope of the method must either be locked with the specified lock\n   token and in the state identified by the \"I am an ETag\" ETag or in\n   the state identified by the second ETag \"I am another ETag\".  To put\n   the matter more plainly one can think of the previous If header as\n   being in the form (or (and <locktoken:a-write-lock-token> [\"I am an\n   ETag\"]) (and [\"I am another ETag\"])).\n\n9.4.2     Tagged-list Production\n\n   The tagged-list production scopes a list production.  That is, it\n   specifies that the lists following the resource specification only\n   apply to the specified resource.  The scope of the resource\n   production begins with the list production immediately following the\n   resource production and ends with the next resource production, if\n   any.\n\n   When the If header is applied to a particular resource, the Tagged-\n   list productions MUST be searched to determine if any of the listed\n   resources match the operand resource(s) for the current method.  If\n\nGoland et al.

If one of the resource productions does\n   match the name of the resource under consideration then the list\n   productions following the resource production MUST be applied to the\n   resource in the manner specified in the previous section.\n\n   The same URI MUST NOT appear more than once in a resource production\n   in an If header.\n\n9.4.2.1   Example - Tagged List If header\n\n   COPY /resource1 HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.foo.bar\n   Destination: http://www.foo.bar/resource2\n   If: <http://www.foo.bar/resource1> (<locktoken:a-write-lock-token>\n   [W/\"A weak ETag\"]) ([\"strong ETag\"])\n   <http://www.bar.bar/random>([\"another strong ETag\"])\n\n   In this example http://www.foo.bar/resource1 is being copied to\n   http://www.foo.bar/resource2.  When the method is first applied to\n   http://www.foo.bar/resource1, resource1 must be in the state\n   specified by \"(<locktoken:a-write-lock-token> [W/\"A weak ETag\"])\n   ([\"strong ETag\"])\", that is, it either must be locked with a lock\n   token of \"locktoken:a-write-lock-token\" and have a weak entity tag\n   W/\"A weak ETag\" or it must have a strong entity tag \"strong ETag\".\n\n   That is the only success condition since the resource\n   http://www.bar.bar/random never has the method applied to it (the\n   only other resource listed in the If header) and\n   http://www.foo.bar/resource2 is not listed in the If header.\n\n9.4.3     not Production\n\n   Every state token or ETag is either current, and hence describes the\n   state of a resource, or is not current, and does not describe the\n   state of a resource. The boolean operation of matching a state token\n   or ETag to the current state of a resource thus resolves to a true\n   or false value.  The not production is used to reverse that value.\n   The scope of the not production is the state-token or entity-tag\n   immediately following it.\n\n   If: (Not <locktoken:write1> <locktoken:write2>)\n\n   When submitted with a request, this If header requires that all\n   operand resources must not be locked with locktoken:write1 and must\n   be locked with locktoken:write2.\n\n9.4.4     Matching Function\n\n   When performing If header processing, the definition of a matching\n   state token or entity tag is as follows.\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 54]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   Matching entity tag: Where the entity tag matches an entity tag\n   associated with that resource.\n\n   Matching state token: Where there is an exact match between the\n   state token in the If header and any state token on the resource.\n\n9.4.5     If Header and Non-DAV Compliant Proxies\n\n   Non-DAV compliant proxies will not honor the If header, since they\n   will not understand the If header, and HTTP requires non-understood\n   headers to be ignored.  When communicating with HTTP/1.1 proxies,\n   the \"Cache-Control: no-cache\" request header MUST be used so as to\n   prevent the proxy from improperly trying to service the request from\n   its cache.  When dealing with HTTP/1.0 proxies the \"Pragma: no-\n   cache\" request header MUST be used for the same reason.\n\n9.5 Lock-Token Header\n\n   Lock-Token = \"Lock-Token\" \":\" Coded-URL\n\n   The Lock-Token request header is used with the UNLOCK method to\n   identify the lock to be removed.  The lock token in the Lock-Token\n   request header MUST identify a lock that contains the resource\n   identified by Request-URI as a member.\n\n   The Lock-Token response header is used with the LOCK method to\n   indicate the lock token created as a result of a successful LOCK\n   request to create a new lock.\n\n9.6 Overwrite Header\n\n   Overwrite = \"Overwrite\" \":\" (\"T\" | \"F\")\n\n   The Overwrite header specifies whether the server should overwrite\n   the state of a non-null destination resource during a COPY or MOVE.\n   A value of \"F\" states that the server must not perform the COPY or\n   MOVE operation if the state of the destination resource is non-null.\n   If the overwrite header is not included in a COPY or MOVE request\n   then the resource MUST treat the request as if it has an overwrite\n   header of value \"T\". While the Overwrite header appears to duplicate\n   the functionality of the If-Match: * header of HTTP/1.1, If-Match\n   applies only to the Request-URI, and not to the Destination of a\n   COPY or MOVE.\n\n   If a COPY or MOVE is not performed due to the value of the Overwrite\n   header, the method MUST fail with a 412 (Precondition Failed) status\n   code.\n\n   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the Overwrite header.\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.

The status code indicates the\n   resolution of the method on the identified resource.  So, for\n   example, if a MOVE method on a collection is outstanding and a 102\n   (Processing) response with a Status-URI response header is returned,\n   the included URIs will indicate resources that have had move\n   attempted on them and what the result was.\n\n9.8 Timeout Request Header\n\n   TimeOut = \"Timeout\" \":\" 1#TimeType\n   TimeType = (\"Second-\" DAVTimeOutVal | \"Infinite\" | Other)\n   DAVTimeOutVal = 1*digit\n   Other = Extend field-value   ; See section 4.2 of [RFC2068]\n\n   Clients may include Timeout headers in their LOCK requests.\n\n   However, the server is not required to honor or even consider these\n   requests.  Clients MUST NOT submit a Timeout request header with any\n   method other than a LOCK method.\n\n   A Timeout request header MUST contain at least one TimeType and may\n   contain multiple TimeType entries. The purpose of listing multiple\n   TimeType entries is to indicate multiple different values and value\n   types that are acceptable to the client.  The client lists the\n   TimeType entries in order of preference.\n\n   Timeout response values MUST use a Second value, Infinite, or a\n   TimeType the client has indicated familiarity with.  The server may\n   assume a client is familiar with any TimeType submitted in a Timeout\n   header.\n\n   The \"Second\" TimeType specifies the number of seconds that will\n   elapse between granting of the lock at the server, and the automatic\n   removal of the lock.  The timeout value for TimeType \"Second\" MUST\n   NOT be greater than 2^32-1.\n\n   The timeout counter SHOULD be restarted any time an owner of the\n   lock sends a method to any member of the lock, including unsupported\n   methods, or methods which are unsuccessful.  However the lock MUST\n   be refreshed if a refresh LOCK method is successfully received.\n\n   If the timeout expires then the lock may be lost.  Specifically, if\n   the server wishes to harvest the lock upon time-out, the server\n   SHOULD act as if an UNLOCK method was executed by the server on the\n\n\nGoland et al.

Thus logs should be updated with the\n   disposition of the lock, notifications should be sent, etc., just as\n   they would be for an UNLOCK request.\n\n   Servers are advised to pay close attention to the values submitted\n   by clients, as they will be indicative of the type of activity the\n   client intends to perform.  For example, an applet running in a\n   browser may need to lock a resource, but because of the instability\n   of the environment within which the applet is running, the applet\n   may be turned off without warning.  As a result, the applet is\n   likely to ask for a relatively small timeout value so that if the\n   applet dies, the lock can be quickly harvested.  However, a document\n   management system is likely to ask for an extremely long timeout\n   because its user may be planning on going off-line.\n\n   A client MUST NOT assume that just because the time-out has expired\n   the lock has been lost.\n\n\n10 Status Code Extensions to HTTP/1.1\n\n   The following status codes are added to those defined in HTTP/1.1\n   [RFC2068].\n\n10.1 102 Processing\n\n   The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to\n   inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request,\n   but has not yet completed it.  This status code SHOULD only be sent\n   when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will\n   take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is\n   taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to\n   process the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The\n   server MUST send a final response after the request has been\n   completed.\n\n   Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process,\n   especially methods that support the Depth header.  In such cases the\n   client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response.  To\n   prevent this the server may return a 102 (Processing) status code to\n   indicate to the client that the server is still processing the\n   method.\n\n10.2 207 Multi-Status\n\n   The 207 (Multi-Status) status code provides status for multiple\n   independent operations (see section 11 for more information).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 57]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n10.3 422 Unprocessable Entity\n\n   The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server\n   understands the content type of the request entity (hence a\n   415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the\n   syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request)\n   status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the\n   contained instructions.  For example, this error condition may occur\n   if an XML request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically\n   correct), but semantically erroneous XML instructions.\n\n10.4 423 Locked\n\n   The 423 (Locked) status code means the source or destination\n   resource of a method is locked.\n\n10.5 424 Failed Dependency\n\n   The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could\n   not be performed on the resource because the requested action\n   depended on another action and that action failed.  For example, if\n   a command in a PROPPATCH method fails then, at minimum, the rest of\n   the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).\n\n10.6 507 Insufficient Storage\n\n   The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could\n   not be performed on the resource because the server is unable to\n   store the representation needed to successfully complete the\n   request.  This condition is considered to be temporary.  If the\n   request which received this status code was the result of a user\n   action, the request MUST NOT be repeated until it is requested by a\n   separate user action.\n\n\n11 Multi-Status Response\n\n   The default 207 (Multi-Status) response body is a text/xml or\n   application/xml HTTP entity that contains a single XML element\n   called multistatus, which contains a set of XML elements called\n   response which contain 200, 300, 400, and 500 series status codes\n   generated during the method invocation.  100 series status codes\n   SHOULD NOT be recorded in a response XML element.\n\n\n12 XML Element Definitions\n\n   In the section below, the final line of each section gives the\n   element type declaration using the format defined in [REC-XML]. The\n   \"Value\" field, where present, specifies futher restrictions on the\n   allowable contents of the XML element using BNF (i.e., to further\n   restrict the values of a PCDATA element).\n\n\nGoland et al.

A resource that\n   is class 2 compliant must also be class 1 compliant; but if\n   additional compliance classes are defined later, a resource that is\n   class 1, 2, and 4 compliant might not be class 3 compliant.  Also\n   note that identifiers other than numbers may be used as compliance\n   class identifiers.\n\n15.1 Class 1\n\n   A class 1 compliant resource MUST meet all \"MUST\" requirements in\n   all sections of this document.\n\n   Class 1 compliant resources MUST return, at minimum, the value \"1\"\n   in the DAV header on all responses to the OPTIONS method.\n\n15.2 Class 2\n\n   A class 2 compliant resource MUST meet all class 1 requirements and\n   support the LOCK method, the supportedlock property, the\n   lockdiscovery property, the Time-Out response header and the Lock-\n   Token request header.  A class \"2\" compliant resource SHOULD also\n   support the Time-Out request header and the owner XML element.\n\n   Class 2 compliant resources MUST return, at minimum, the values \"1\"\n   and \"2\" in the DAV header on all responses to the OPTIONS method.\n\n\n16 Internationalization Considerations\n\n   In the realm of internationalization, this specification complies\n   with the IETF Character Set Policy [RFC2277]. In this specification,\n   human-readable fields can be found either in the value of a\n   property, or in an error message returned in a response entity body.\n   In both cases, the human-readable content is encoded using XML,\n   which has explicit provisions for character set tagging and\n   encoding, and requires that XML processors read XML elements\n   encoded, at minimum, using the UTF-8 [UTF-8] encoding of the ISO\n   10646 multilingual plane.  XML examples in this specification\n   demonstrate use of the charset parameter of the Content-Type header,\n   as defined in [RFC2376], as well as the XML \"encoding\" attribute,\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 73]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   which together provide charset identification information for MIME\n   and XML processors.\n\n   XML also provides a language tagging capability for specifying the\n   language of the contents of a particular XML element.  XML uses\n   either IANA registered language tags (see [RFC1766]) or ISO 639\n   language tags [ISO-639] in the \"xml:lang\" attribute of an XML\n   element to identify the language of its content and attributes.\n\n   WebDAV applications MUST support the character set tagging,\n   character set encoding, and the language tagging functionality of\n   the XML specification.  Implementors of WebDAV applications are\n   strongly encouraged to read \"XML Media Types\" [RFC2376] for\n   instruction on which MIME media type to use for XML transport, and\n   on use of the charset parameter of the Content-Type header.\n\n   Names used within this specification fall into three categories:\n   names of protocol elements such as methods and headers, names of XML\n   elements, and names of properties.  Naming of protocol elements\n   follows the precedent of HTTP, using English names encoded in\n   USASCII for methods and headers.  Since these protocol elements are\n   not visible to users, and are in fact simply long token identifiers,\n   they do not need to support encoding in multiple character sets.\n   Similarly, though the names of XML elements used in this\n   specification are English names encoded in UTF-8, these names are\n   not visible to the user, and hence do not need to support multiple\n   character set encodings.\n\n   The name of a property defined on a resource is a URI.  Although\n   some applications (e.g., a generic property viewer) will display\n   property URIs directly to their users, it is expected that the\n   typical application will use a fixed set of properties, and will\n   provide a mapping from the property name URI to a human-readable\n   field when displaying the property name to a user.  It is only in\n   the case where the set of properties is not known ahead of time that\n   an application need display a property name URI to a user. We\n   recommend that applications provide human-readable property names\n   wherever feasible.\n\n   For error reporting, we follow the convention of HTTP/1.1 status\n   codes, including with each status code a short, English description\n   of the code (e.g., 423 (Locked)).  While the possibility exists that\n   a poorly crafted user agent would display this message to a user,\n   internationalized applications will ignore this message, and display\n   an appropriate message in the user's language and character set.\n\n   Since interoperation of clients and servers does not require locale\n   information, this specification does not specify any mechanism for\n   transmission of this information.\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 74]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n\n17 Security Considerations\n\n   This section is provided to detail issues concerning security\n   implications of which WebDAV applications need to be aware.\n\n   All of the security considerations of HTTP/1.1 (discussed in\n   [RFC2068]) and XML (discussed in [RFC2376]) also apply to WebDAV. In\n   addition, the security risks inherent in remote authoring require\n   stronger authentication technology, introduce several new privacy\n   concerns, and may increase the hazards from poor server design.\n   These issues are detailed below.\n\n17.1 Authentication of Clients\n\n   Due to their emphasis on authoring, WebDAV servers need to use\n   authentication technology to protect not just access to a network\n   resource, but the integrity of the resource as well.  Furthermore,\n   the introduction of locking functionality requires support for\n   authentication.\n\n   A password sent in the clear over an insecure channel is an\n   inadequate means for protecting the accessibility and integrity of a\n   resource as the password may be intercepted.  Since Basic\n   authentication for HTTP/1.1 performs essentially clear text\n   transmission of a password, Basic authentication MUST NOT be used to\n   authenticate a WebDAV client to a server unless the connection is\n   secure. Furthermore, a WebDAV server MUST NOT send Basic\n   authentication credentials in a WWW-Authenticate header unless the\n   connection is secure.  Examples of secure connections include a\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection employing a strong cipher\n   suite with mutual authentication of client and server, or a\n   connection over a network which is physically secure, for example,\n   an isolated network in a building with restricted access.\n\n   WebDAV applications MUST support the Digest authentication scheme\n   [RFC2069]. Since Digest authentication verifies that both parties to\n   a communication know a shared secret, a password, without having to\n   send that secret in the clear, Digest authentication avoids the\n   security problems inherent in Basic authentication while providing a\n   level of authentication which is useful in a wide range of\n   scenarios.\n\n17.2 Denial of Service\n\n   Denial of service attacks are of special concern to WebDAV servers.\n   WebDAV plus HTTP enables denial of service attacks on every part of\n   a system's resources.\n\n   The underlying storage can be attacked by PUTting extremely large\n   files.\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 75]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   Asking for recursive operations on large collections can attack\n   processing time.\n\n   Making multiple pipelined requests on multiple connections can\n   attack network connections.\n\n   WebDAV servers need to be aware of the possibility of a denial of\n   service attack at all levels.\n\n17.3 Security through Obscurity\n\n   WebDAV provides, through the PROPFIND method, a mechanism for\n   listing the member resources of a collection.  This greatly\n   diminishes the effectiveness of security or privacy techniques that\n   rely only on the difficulty of discovering the names of network\n   resources.  Users of WebDAV servers are encouraged to use access\n   control techniques to prevent unwanted access to resources, rather\n   than depending on the relative obscurity of their resource names.\n\n17.4 Privacy Issues Connected to Locks\n\n   When submitting a lock request a user agent may also submit an owner\n   XML field giving contact information for the person taking out the\n   lock (for those cases where a person, rather than a robot, is taking\n   out the lock). This contact information is stored in a lockdiscovery\n   property on the resource, and can be used by other collaborators to\n   begin negotiation over access to the resource.  However, in many\n   cases this contact information can be very private, and should not\n   be widely disseminated.  Servers SHOULD limit read access to the\n   lockdiscovery property as appropriate.  Furthermore, user agents\n   SHOULD provide control over whether contact information is sent at\n   all, and if contact information is sent, control over exactly what\n   information is sent.\n\n17.5 Privacy Issues Connected to Properties\n\n   Since property values are typically used to hold information such as\n   the author of a document, there is the possibility that privacy\n   concerns could arise stemming from widespread access to a resource's\n   property data.  To reduce the risk of inadvertent release of private\n   information via properties, servers are encouraged to develop access\n   control mechanisms that separate read access to the resource body\n   and read access to the resource's properties.  This allows a user to\n   control the dissemination of their property data without overly\n   restricting access to the resource's contents.\n\n17.6 Reduction of Security due to Source Link\n\n   HTTP/1.1 warns against providing read access to script code because\n   it may contain sensitive information.  Yet WebDAV, via its source\n   link facility, can potentially provide a URI for script resources so\n   they may be authored.  For HTTP/1.1, a server could reasonably\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 76]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   prevent access to source resources due to the predominance of read-\n   only access.  WebDAV, with its emphasis on authoring, encourages\n   read and write access to source resources, and provides the source\n   link facility to identify the source.  This reduces the security\n   benefits of eliminating access to source resources.  Users and\n   administrators of WebDAV servers should be very cautious when\n   allowing remote authoring of scripts, limiting read and write access\n   to the source resources to authorized principals.\n\n17.7 Implications of XML External Entities\n\n   XML supports a facility known as \"external entities\", defined in\n   section 4.2.2 of [REC-XML], which instruct an XML processor to\n   retrieve and perform an inline include of XML located at a\n   particular URI. An external XML entity can be used to append or\n   modify the document type declaration (DTD) associated with an XML\n   document.  An external XML entity can also be used to include XML\n   within the content of an XML document.  For non-validating XML, such\n   as the XML used in this specification, including an external XML\n   entity is not required by [REC-XML]. However, [REC-XML] does state\n   that an XML processor may, at its discretion, include the external\n   XML entity.\n\n   External XML entities have no inherent trustworthiness and are\n   subject to all the attacks that are endemic to any HTTP GET request.\n   Furthermore, it is possible for an external XML entity to modify the\n   DTD, and hence affect the final form of an XML document, in the\n   worst case significantly modifying its semantics, or exposing the\n   XML processor to the security risks discussed in [RFC2376].\n   Therefore, implementers must be aware that external XML entities\n   should be treated as untrustworthy.\n\n   There is also the scalability risk that would accompany a widely\n   deployed application which made use of external XML entities.  In\n   this situation, it is possible that there would be significant\n   numbers of requests for one external XML entity, potentially\n   overloading any server which fields requests for the resource\n   containing the external XML entity.\n\n17.8 Risks Connected with Lock Tokens\n\n   This specification, in section 6.4, requires the use of Universal\n   Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) for lock tokens, in order to guarantee\n   their uniqueness across space and time.  UUIDs, as defined in [ISO-\n   11578], contain a \"node\" field which \"consists of the IEEE address,\n   usually the host address.  For systems with multiple IEEE 802 nodes,\n   any available node address can be used.\"  Since a WebDAV server will\n   issue many locks over its lifetime, the implication is that it will\n   also be publicly exposing its IEEE 802 address.\n\n   There are several risks associated with exposure of IEEE 802\n   addresses.  Using the IEEE 802 address:\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 77]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   * It is possible to track the movement of hardware from subnet to\n   subnet.\n\n   * It may be possible to identify the manufacturer of the hardware\n   running a WebDAV server.\n\n   * It may be possible to determine the number of each type of\n   computer running WebDAV.\n\n   Section 6.4.1 of this specification details an alternate mechanism\n   for generating the \"node\" field of a UUID without using an IEEE 802\n   address, which alleviates the risks associated with exposure of IEEE\n   802 addresses by using an alternate source of uniqueness.\n\n\n18 IANA Considerations\n\n   This document defines two namespaces, the namespace of property\n   names, and the namespace of WebDAV-specific XML elements used within\n   property values.\n\n   URIs are used for both names, for several reasons. Assignment of a\n   URI does not require a request to a central naming authority, and\n   hence allow WebDAV property names and XML elements to be quickly\n   defined by any WebDAV user or application.  URIs also provide a\n   unique address space, ensuring that the distributed users of WebDAV\n   will not have collisions among the property names and XML elements\n   they create.\n\n   This specification defines a distinguished set of property names and\n   XML elements that are understood by all WebDAV applications.  The\n   property names and XML elements in this specification are all\n   derived from the base URI DAV: by adding a suffix to this URI, for\n   example, DAV:creationdate for the \"creationdate\" property.\n\n   This specification also defines a URI scheme for the encoding of\n   lock tokens, the opaquelocktoken URI scheme described in section\n   6.4.\n\n   To ensure correct interoperation based on this specification, IANA\n   must reserve the URI namespaces starting with \"DAV:\" and with\n   \"opaquelocktoken:\" for use by this specification, its revisions, and\n   related WebDAV specifications.\n\n\n19 Copyright\n\n   The following copyright notice is copied from RFC 2026 [RFC2026],\n   section 10.4, and describes the applicable copyright for this\n   document.\n\n   Copyright (C) The Internet Society 1998.

So the equivalent time in UTC can be determined by\n   subtracting the offset from the local time.  For example, 18:50:00-\n   04:00 is the same time as 22:58:00Z.\n\n   If the time in UTC is known, but the offset to local time is\n   unknown, this can be represented with an offset of \"-00:00\".  This\n   differs from an offset of \"Z\" which implies that UTC is the\n   preferred reference point for the specified time.\n\n24.3 Appendix 3 - Notes on Processing XML Elements\n\n24.3.1    Notes on Empty XML Elements\n\n   XML supports two mechanisms for indicating that an XML element does\n   not have any content.  The first is to declare an XML element of the\n   form <A></A>.  The second is to declare an XML element of the form\n   <A/>.  The two XML elements are semantically identical.\n\n   It is a violation of the XML specification to use the <A></A> form\n   if the associated DTD declares the element to be EMPTY (e.g.,\n   <!ELEMENT A EMPTY>).  If such a statement is included, then the\n   empty element format, <A/> must be used.  If the element is not\n   delcared to be EMPTY, then either form <A></A> or <A/> may be used\n   for empty elements.\n\n24.3.2    Notes on Illegal XML Processing\n\n   XML is a flexible data format that makes it easy to submit data that\n   appears legal but in fact is not.  The philosophy of \"Be flexible in\n   what you accept and strict in what you send\" still applies, but it\n   must not be applied inappropriately.  XML is extremely flexible in\n   dealing with issues of white space, element ordering, inserting new\n   elements, etc.  This flexibility does not require extension,\n   especially not in the area of the meaning of elements.\n\n   There is no kindness in accepting illegal combinations of XML\n   elements.  At best it will cause an unwanted result and at worst it\n   can cause real damage.\n\n\n24.3.2.1  Example - XML Syntax Error\n\n   The following request body for a PROPFIND method is illegal.\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n     <D:allprop/>\n     <D:propname/>\n   </D:propfind>\n\n\nGoland et al.

Thus the above is an error and\n   must be responded to with a 400 (Bad Request).\n\n   Imagine, however, that a server wanted to be \"kind\" and decided to\n   pick the allprop element as the true element and respond to it.  A\n   client running over a bandwidth limited line who intended to execute\n   a propname would be in for a big surprise if the server treated the\n   command as an allprop.\n\n   Additionally, if a server were lenient and decided to reply to this\n   request, the results would vary randomly from server to server, with\n   some servers executing the allprop directive, and others executing\n   the propname directive. This reduces interoperability rather than\n   increasing it.\n\n24.3.2.2  Example - Unknown XML Element\n\n   The previous example was illegal because it contained two elements\n   that were explicitly banned from appearing together in the propfind\n   element.  However, XML is an extensible language, so one can imagine\n   new elements being defined for use with propfind.  Below is the\n   request body of a PROPFIND and, like the previous example, must be\n   rejected with a 400 (Bad Request) by a server that does not\n   understand the expired-props element.\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"\n   xmlns:E=\"http://www.foo.bar/standards/props/\">\n     <E:expired-props/>\n   </D:propfind>\n\n   To understand why a 400 (Bad Request) is returned let us look at the\n   request body as the server unfamiliar with expired-props sees it.\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"\n               xmlns:E=\"http://www.foo.bar/standards/props/\">\n   </D:propfind>\n\n   As the server does not understand the expired-props element,\n   according to the WebDAV-specific XML processing rules specified in\n   section 14, it must ignore it.  Thus the server sees an empty\n   propfind, which by the definition of the propfind element is\n   illegal.\n\n   Please note that had the extension been additive it would not\n   necessarily have resulted in a 400 (Bad Request).  For example,\n   imagine the following request body for a PROPFIND:\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.

Its\n   purpose is to prevent the return of any property whose name matches\n   the submitted pattern.  If the previous example were submitted to a\n   server unfamiliar with leave-out, the only result would be that the\n   leave-out element would be ignored and a propname would be executed.\n\n24.4 Appendix 4 -- XML Namespaces for WebDAV\n\n24.4.1    Introduction\n\n   To provide a unique space of XML element names which has\n   decentralized extensibility, this specification uses a feature of\n   XML known as XML \"namespaces\".  This appendix provides a normative\n   reference for XML namespace functionality for implementations of\n   this specification.  All DAV compliant systems MUST support the XML\n   namespace extension as specified in this appendix.\n\n   The remainder of this appendix is intended to match, as closely as\n   needed, the text in WD-xml-names-19980916, \"Namespaces in XML\",\n   edited by Tim Bray, Dave Hollander, and Andrew Layman [WD-XML-\n   NAMES].  To meet this goal, the text in this appendix is mostly\n   quoted verbatim from sections 1-6 of that source.  However, some\n   minor changes were made, specifically to make the references match\n   the style of this document, and a forward reference to appendix A\n   (non-normative) of [REC-XML] was removed, as no appendices of [REC-\n   XML] are duplicated here.\n\n24.4.2    Motivation and Summary\n\n   We envision applications of Extensible Markup Language (XML) where a\n   single XML document may contain elements and attributes that are\n   defined for and used by multiple software modules. One motivation\n   for this is modularity; if such a markup vocabulary exists which is\n   well-understood and for which there is useful software available, it\n   is better to re-use this markup rather than re-invent it.\n\n   Such documents, containing multiple markup vocabularies, pose\n   problems of recognition and collision. Software modules need to be\n   able to recognize the tags and attributes which they are designed to\n   process, even in the face of \"collisions\" occurring when markup\n   intended for some other software package uses the same element type\n   or attribute name.\n\n   These considerations require that document constructs should have\n   universal names, whose scope extends beyond their containing\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 88]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   document. This specification describes a mechanism, XML namespaces,\n   which accomplishes this.\n\n   [Definition:] An XML namespace is a collection of names, identified\n   by a URI, which are used in XML documents as element types and\n   attribute names. XML namespaces differ from the \"namespaces\"\n   conventionally used in computing disciplines in that the XML version\n   has internal structure and is not, mathematically speaking, a set.\n\n   Names from XML namespaces may appear as qualified names, which\n   contain a single colon, separating the name into a namespace prefix\n   and a local part. The prefix, which is mapped to a URI [RFC2396],\n   selects a namespace. The combination of the universally managed URI\n   namespace and the document's own namespace produces identifiers that\n   are universally unique. Mechanisms are provided for prefix scoping\n   and defaulting to avoid clutter and improve readability.\n\n   URIs can contain characters not allowed in names, so cannot be used\n   directly as namespace prefixes. Therefore, the namespace prefix\n   serves as a proxy for a URI. An attribute-based syntax described\n   below is used to declare the association of the namespace prefix\n   with a URI; software which supports this namespace proposal must\n   recognize and act on these declarations and prefixes.\n\n24.4.3    Declaring Namespaces\n\n   Note that many of the nonterminals in the productions in section 24\n   of this specification are defined not here but in the XML\n   specification [REC-XML]. When nonterminals defined here have the\n   same names as nonterminals defined in the XML specification, the\n   productions here in all cases match a subset of the strings matched\n   by the corresponding ones there.\n\n   [Definition:] A namespace is declared using an attribute whose\n   prefix is xmlns as follows:\n\n   Namespace declaration using attributes\n\n   [1]  NSDecl ::=  PrefixDef Eq AttValue [  NSC: Empty URI ]\n   [2]  PrefixDef ::=  'xmlns' (':' NCName)? [  NSC: Leading \"XML\" ]\n   [3]  NCName ::=  (Letter | '_') (NCNameChar)* /*  An XML Name,\n                                                     minus the \":\" */\n   [4]  NCNameChar ::=  Letter | Digit | '.' | '-' | '_' |\n                        CombiningChar | Extender\n\n\n   [Definition:] The AttValue in the NSDecl production is a URI which\n   functions as a namespace name to identify the namespace. The\n   namespace name, to serve its intended purpose, should have the\n   characteristics of uniqueness and persistence. It is not a goal that\n   it be directly usable for retrieval of a schema (if any exists). An\n   example of a syntax that is designed with these goals in mind is\n\nGoland et al.

However, it should be\n   noted that ordinary URLs can be managed in such a way as to achieve\n   these same goals.\n\n   [Definition:] In the PrefixDef production, if the optional colon and\n   NCName are provided, then that NCName gives the namespace prefix,\n   used to associate names with this namespace in the scope of the\n   element to which the declaration is attached.\n\n   [Definition:] If the colon and NCName are not provided, then the\n   associated namespace name is that of the default namespace in the\n   scope of the element to which the declaration is attached.\n\n   Namespace Constraint: Empty URI\n   The AttValue may be empty only if the PrefixDef is simply xmlns,\n   i.e. is declaring a default namespace. Default namespaces and\n   overriding of declarations are discussed in \"5. Applying Namespaces\n   to Elements and Attributes\".\n\n   Namespace Constraint: Leading \"XML\"\n   Prefixes beginning with the three-letter sequence x, m, l, in any\n   case combination, are reserved for use by XML and XML-related\n   specifications.\n\n   An example namespace declaration:\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n     <x xmlns:edi='http://ecommerce.org/schema'>\n       <!-- the edi namespace applies to the \"x\" element and contents -\n   ->\n     </x>\n\n\n24.4.4    Qualified Names\n\n   [Definition:] In XML documents conforming to this specification,\n   some names (constructs corresponding to the nonterminal Name) may be\n   given as qualified names, defined as follows:\n\n   Qualified Name\n\n   [5]  QName ::=  (Prefix ':')? LocalPart\n   [6]  Prefix ::=  NCName\n   [7]  LocalPart ::=  NCName\n\n\n   The Prefix provides the namespace prefix part of the qualified name,\n   and must be associated with a namespace URI in a namespace\n   declaration. [Definition:] The LocalPart provides the local part of\n   the qualified name.\n\n\n\nGoland et al.                                                [Page 90]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT                  WebDAV               November 16, 1998\n\n\n\n   Note that the prefix functions only as a placeholder for a namespace\n   name. Applications should use the namespace name, not the prefix, in\n   constructing names whose scope extends beyond the containing\n   document.\n\n24.4.5    Using Qualified Names\n\n   In XML documents conforming to this specification, element types are\n   given as qualified names, as follows:\n\n   Element Types and Attribute Names\n\n   [8]  STag ::=  '<' QName (S Attribute)* S? '>'  [  NSC: Prefix\n   Declared ]\n   [9]  ETag ::=  '</' QName S? '>' [  NSC: Prefix Declared ]\n   [10]  EmptyElemTag ::=  '<' QName (S Attribute)* S? '/>' [  NSC:\n   Prefix Declared ]\n\n\n   Attribute names are given as qualified names, as follows:\n\n   Attribute\n\n   [11]  Attribute ::=  QName Eq AttValue [  NSC: Prefix Declared ]\n\n\n   Namespace Constraint: Prefix Declared\n   The namespace prefix, unless it is xml or xmlns, must have been\n   declared in a namespace declaration attribute in either the start-\n   tag of the element where the prefix is used or in an an ancestor\n   element (i.e. an element in whose content the prefixed markup\n   occurs). The prefix xml is by definition bound to the namespace name\n   urn:Connolly:input:required. The prefix xmlns is used only for\n   namespace bindings and is not itself bound to any namespace name.\n\n   This constraint may lead to operational difficulties in the case\n   where the namespace declaration attribute is provided, not directly\n   in the XML document entity, but via a default attribute declared in\n   an external entity. Such declarations may not be read by software\n   which is based on a non-validating XML processor. Many XML\n   applications, presumably including namespace-sensitive ones, fail to\n   require validating processors. For correct operation with such\n   applications, namespace declarations must be provided either\n   directly or via default attributes declared in the internal subset\n   of the DTD.\n\n   Element names and attribute types are also given as qualified names\n   when they appear in declarations in the DTD:\n\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.

If the\n   URI in a default namespace declaration is empty, then unprefixed\n   elements in the scope of the declaration are not considered to be in\n   any namespace. Note that default namespaces do not apply directly to\n   attributes.\n\nGoland et al.

However, the declared type of attribute values is in\n   principle only available in documents which have been validated.\n   Thus, in well-formed XML documents, there can be no assurance that\n   the contents of attribute values have been checked for conformance\n   to this specification.\n\n24.4.9    Meaning of Qualified Names\n\n   [Note to the reader: This section does not appear in [WD-XML-NAMES],\n   but is necessary to avoid ambiguity for WebDAV XML processors.]\n\n   WebDAV compliant XML processors MUST interpret a qualified name as a\n   URI constructed by appending the LocalPart to the namespace name\n   URI.\n\n   Example\n\n   <del:glider xmlns:del=\"http://www.del.jensen.org/\">\n     <del:glidername>\n          Johnny Updraft\n     </del:glidername>\n     <del:glideraccidents/>\n   </del:glider>\n\n   In this example, the qualified element name \"del:glider\" is\n   interpreted as the URL \"http://www.del.jensen.org/glider\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoland et al.
