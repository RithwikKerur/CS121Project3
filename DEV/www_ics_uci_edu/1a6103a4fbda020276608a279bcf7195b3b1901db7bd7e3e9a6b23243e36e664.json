What shapes can be\nused as the tiles in spiral tilings? How many neighbors can each\ntile have? What are the symmetries of these tilings?</p>\n\n<h2>Complex Numbers</h2>\n\nA spiral is formed by a combination of two simultaneous motions:\nexpansion and twisting around the center of the spiral. \n\n<p>The same combination of motions arises in multiplying complex\nnumbers <i>a</i>+<i>b</i>i. If we think of these numbers as forming\na plane, then multiplying all the points of any configuration in\nthat plane by <i>a</i>+<i>b</i>i can be carried out geometrically,\nby expanding the configuration away from the origin by a factor of\nsqrt(<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>+<i>b</i><sup>2</sup>), and simultanously\ntwisting the configuration around the origin by an angle of\ntan<sup>-1</sup>(<i>a</i>/<i>b</i>).</p>\n\n<p>For this reason it makes sense to use complex number\nmultiplication to represent the symmetries of a spiral tiling.</p>\n\n<h2>Definitions</h2>\n\n<p>We define a <i>tile</i> to be an open connected subset of the\ncomplex number plane.</p>\n\n<p>We define a <i>tiling</i> to be a set of disjoint tiles, the\nclosure of which covers the entire complex number plane.</p>\n\n<p>We define a <i>complex symmetry</i> of a tiling to be a complex\nnumber such that multiplying each tile by that number produces\nanother tile of the same tiling.</p>\n\n<p>We define a <i>spiral tiling</i> to be a tiling in which for any\ntwo tiles <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>, some complex symmetry of the\ntiling maps <i>s</i> to <i>t</i>.</p>\n\n<p>The last definition can be rephrased as saying that the\nsymmetries act <i>transitively</i> on the tiles. Note that these\ndefinitions are different from the notion of a spiral tiling used\nby Gr&uuml;nbaum and Shephard [Tilings and Patterns, W.H. Freeman\n1987, pp. 512-516], which does not involve similarity and is\ngenerally rather less well-defined than the above (the \"I know it\nwhen I see it\" test applies). Some material closer to what we have\nhere can be found in the same book [pp. 520-522].</p>\n\n<h2>Uniqueness of Tile Mappings</h2>\n\nWe know from the definition that, for any two tiles <i>s</i> and\n<i>t</i> in a spiral tiling, some complex number <i>z</i> satisfies\nthe set-theoretic equation <i>s*z</i>=<i>t</i>. Can there be more\nthan one such <i>z</i>? \n\n<p>Consider the distances d(<i>s</i>) and d(<i>t</i>) of each from\nthe origin. Since complex multiplication acts on these distances,\nthe magnitude of <i>z</i> must be d(<i>t</i>)/d(<i>s</i>). What\nabout its orientation?</p>\n\n<p>Suppose <i>s*y</i>=<i>s*z</i>=<i>t</i>. Then\ns*(<i>z</i>/<i>y</i>)=s, so <i>s</i> is invariant by some rotation\nabout the origin. The only such tiles can be annuli in which the\ntwo boundary components are similarly invariant and similar to each\nother.</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"annuli.gif\" width=\"372\" height=\"290\"\nalt=\"\"></div>\n\n<p>We treat this case as degenerate; from now on we assume that it\ndoes not occur in our tilings. So in a non-degenerate spiral\ntiling, the symmetry <i>z</i> mapping <i>s</i> to <i>t</i> is\nuniquely defined. We denote this symmetry by <i>t</i>/<i>s</i>.</p>\n\n<h2>Symmetries of Spiral Tilings</h2>\n\nThe symmetries of a spiral tiling, like any other collection of\nsymmetries, form a <i>group</i>: the product of two symmetries is\nanother symmetry, as is the inverse of any symmetry, and products\nare associative. The group product here is just complex number\nmultiplication. Because of the uniqueness of the mapping from one\ntile to another, the group must be <i>discrete</i>: any symmetry\n<i>z</i> has a neighborhood in the complex number plane that\ncontains only that symmetry. For, if <i>z</i> maps some point <i>\nx</i> in the interior of tile <i>s</i> to the corresponding point\nin the interior of tile <i>t</i>, any other complex number\nsufficiently near <i>z</i> would also map <i>x</i> into the\ninterior of tile <i>t</i>, by continuity of complex multiplication.\nWe can summarize this conclusion by saying that the group G of\nsymmetries of a spiral tiling must be a discrete subgroup of\nmultiplication of nonzero complex numbers. \n\n<p> If we choose a reference point 1 in some tile containing that\npoint, the images of that point 1*G=G give one reference point in\neach tile, so the members of G are in one-to-one correspondence\nwith the tiles of the spiral tiling. We can think of each tile as\nforming a canonical neighborhood or <i>fundamental domain</i>\naround each symmetry <i>z</i>.</p>\n\n<h2>The Exponential Map</h2>\n\nThe function exp(<i>z</i>) has the nice property that it translates\naddition to multiplication:\nexp(<i>y</i>+<i>z</i>)=exp(<i>y</i>)*exp(<i>z</i>). The inverse\nfunction log(<i>z</i>) should therefore translate multiplication to\naddition, so we can use it to understand the multiplicative\nsymmetry group G in terms of the simpler addition operation. \n\n<p>There is a slight complication: exp(<i>z</i>) is not one-to-one,\nsince exp(<i>z</i>)=exp(<i>z</i>+2pi). Therefore a more-or-less\narbitrary choice has to be made about which value to use as the\ninverse. In our case, we are interested in set-theoretic inverses,\nso we use the notation log(G) to denote the set { <i>z</i> :\nexp(<i>z</i>) in G }.</p>\n\n<p>Then if G is a multiplicative subgroup of the complex numbers,\nlog(G) is an additive subgroup. And if G is a discrete set, log(G)\nis also discrete. So if G is the set of symmetries of a spiral\ntiling, log(G) is a discrete subgroup of the additive complex\nnumbers. There are only two possibilities for what such a subgroup\ncan look like: either it is a <a href= \n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/lattice.html\"><i>\nlattice</i></a>, or it is the set of integer multiples K<i>z</i> of\na single generator <i>z</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Note finally that 2 pi i is a member of log(G), since it is in\nlog(1). So if log(G) is a lattice, it is a lattice containing the\nvector 2 pi i. And if log(G) is of the form K<i>z</i>, then <i>\nz</i> must be purely imaginary, so G (which consists of the powers\nof exp(<i>z</i>)) must consist purely of rotations. If so, we have\nanother degenerate case in which some finite number of infinite\nwedges tile the plane by fitting together at the origin.</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"wedges.gif\" width=\"372\" height=\"290\"\nalt=\"\"></div>\n\n<p>Therefore from now on, we can assume that any non-degenerate\nspiral tiling is of the form exp(T) where T is a periodic\n(congruence) tiling having a translation by 2 pi i among its\nlattice of translational symmetries.</p>\n\n<h2>Neighborhoods in Spiral Tilings</h2>\n\nHow many tiles can surround a given tile in a spiral tiling? By\ntransitivity of the symmetry group, the answer is independent of\nwhich tile is chosen. Some manipulation with <a href= \n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Euler\ncharacteristics</a> shows that the number of neighbors can only be\ntwo, four, or six. \n\n<p>In more detail, if one glues the edges of the tile together in a\npattern formed by how it connects to its neighbors, one gets a <i>\nmanifold</i>, a space which near each point \"looks like\" the plane.\nThe analysis above, showing that the tiling comes from applying the\nexponential map to a periodic tiling, shows that this manifold must\nbe topologically equivalent to a torus, so Euler's formula tells us\nthat V-E+F=0, where F is the number of faces in the manifold (just\none), E is the number of edges, and V is the number of vertices.\nNow if the tile has k neighbors, it contributes k sides of edges to\nE, but each edge has two sides so E=k/2 and k must be even.\nFurther, each vertex has at least three ends of edges, and each\nedge has two ends, so 2E&lt;=3V, which combined with Euler's\nformula E=V+1 implies that E&lt;=3.</p>\n\n<p>The case that k=2 gives us our third type of degenerate tiling.\nThis case occurs when the lattice log(G) is generated by the two\nvalues pi i and <i>x</i> for some real <i>x</i>, so the only\nsymmetries of the tiling are expansions (without rotation) and\nreflection through the origin. The tiles in this degenerate case\nmust be infinite strips, the two boundaries of which are similar to\neach other.</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"strips.gif\" width=\"372\" height=\"290\"\nalt=\"\"></div>\n\n<p>In the remaining cases, the tiles are combinatorially equivalent\nto quadrilaterals or hexagons (they may take other shapes,\nincluding triangles and pentagons, but they have either four or six\nneighbors, and are adjacent to four or six vertices where more than\ntwo tiles meet). This is a key difference from periodic tilings,\nwhich also allow tiles with three neighbors.</p>\n\n<h2>Which Quadrilaterals Tile?</h2>\n\nWe now discuss necessary conditions for a polygon to form a spiral\ntiling. Because of the analysis above, the most important polygons\nto consider are quadrilaterals and hexagons. We don't consider\ntriangles and pentagons separately, as in any spiral tiling such a\npolygon would have to have vertices placed along its sides, and\ncould therefore be considered a type of quadrilateral or hexagon\nwith certain angles equal to pi. \n\n<p>As described by Thurston [Three-Dimensional Geometry and\nTopology, unpublished manuscript, 1990, p. 137] any quadrilateral\ncan be fitted into similar copies of itself in a way that locally\nlooks like part of a spiral tiling. This construction is known as\nthe \"developing map\" and is a special case of a construction that\nworks for arbitrary manifolds. However, there are some nonlocal\nrequirements on the shape of quadrilaterals that form spiral\ntilings. If one applies the developing map construction to an\narbitrary quadrilateral, the result usually overlaps itself or has\ncracks that can not be filled.</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"developing-map.gif\" width=\"326\"\nheight=\"272\" alt=\"\"></div>\n\n<p>The space of all quadrilateral shapes can be specified by four\nparameters (e.g. two angles and two edge lengths). It seems that\nthe requirement that the developing map meets up with itself\ncorresponds to a restriction to a two-dimensional subspace of the\nquadrilateral shapes. Is there a reasonable way to describe that\nsubspace?</p>\n\n<h2>Which Hexagons Tile?</h2>\n\nOne method of investigating spiral tilings of hexagons is to\nobserve that, since any such tiling is the exponential image of a\nperiodic tiling, it has a fundamental quadrilateral. There is no\nloss of generality in assuming that the vertices of this\nquadrilateral are vertices of the hexagonal tiling. \n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"fundquad.gif\" width=\"372\" height=\n\"290\" alt=\"\"></div>\n\n<p>So it must be possible to <a href= \n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/dissect.html\">\ndissect</a> the hexagon into pieces that can be reassembled\n(allowing similarity) into a quadrilateral that forms a spiral\ntiling. One simple necessary condition for the tiling to exist is\nthat one must be able to group the hexagon vertices into two\ntriples, each triple adding to 2 pi. Do these two triples have to\nalternate around the hexagon, as they do in the tiling above? What\nother conditions are necessary?</p>\n\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n\nWe have defined spiral similarity tilings in terms of a transitive\ngroup of complex multiplications. After identifying three possible\ndegenerate forms of tiling (nested annuli, finitely many infinite\nwedges, and infinitely many infinite strips) we showed that the\nremaining spiral tilings have tiles combinatorially equivalent to\nquadrilaterals meeting four at a vertex, or hexagons meeting three\nat a vertex. These tilings are generated by applying the\nexponential map to periodic tilings with certain restrictions on\nthe lattice of translational symmetries. Finally, we began a\npreliminary classification of the quadrilaterals and hexagons that\nform spiral tilins. \n\n<hr>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p>From the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational and recreational geometry.<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>, <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>, <a href= \n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC\nIrvine</a>.</p>\n\n<p><small>Last update: \n<!--#flastmod file=\"index.html\" -->.</small></p>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
