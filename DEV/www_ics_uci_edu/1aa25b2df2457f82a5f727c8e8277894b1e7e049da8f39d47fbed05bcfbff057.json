Perhaps I would \nbe sick of the sun and I really want to go someplace where it is cold \nand you have to dig your car out of the snow every morning.  I'm \nbrowsing around the Internet and I find <A \nHREF=\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/\">The Virtual Tourist World \nMap</A>.  I can narrow it down to the U.S. because of cost, and I look \nback on the east coast just because everyone knows that it is frigid \nthere in the winter.  I think that I will look at Vermont, but only \nbecause not many people talk about Vermont, and it can't be that bad.  \nI can find a place in the CyberMont directory about Vermont from the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.cybermalls.com/cymont/vermont/index.html\">Departmemt \nof Travel and Tourism.</A> \n<p><IMG SRC=\"http://www.cybermalls.com/cymont/vermont/4skr001a.gif\"> Now, \nI think that this looks like a pretty neat scene.  The travel bureau did \na good job with this one.  Plus there are many more images and \ndescriptions that can help with the decision on the vacation.  Coming \nsoon to the page are different listings on vacation packages and other \nvital information when planning a trip.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Let's return to the list of questions!</it></a> </p>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What can the Internet do for a \nheavy metal band?</H2>\n<IMG SRC=\"http://bazaar.com/Megadeth/Gifs/caution.gif\"> \n</A> This icon from the heavy metal group Megadeth is just part of that \ngroup's stab at a page on the WWW.  Their page(s) include all kinds of \ntrivia, images, video, samples of their work in digital sound (of course), \nas well as the marketing of paraphanalia that some people might just \nbuy.  the capabilities of such a system as a form of advertisement are \nonly going to grow, and though possibly slightly twisted at times, \nMegadeth has overachieved in their attempt.  You can go to <A \nHREF=http://bazaar.com/Megadeth/megadeth.html>Megadeth Arizona</A> and \nsee all of their techniques.  \n<p> How can you go \nwrong with faces like <A HREF=\"http://bazaar.com/Megadeth/Gifs/group.jpg\">\nthese? <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM \nSRC=\"http://bazaar.com/Megadeth/Gifs/group.gif\"></A>  And you can even \nclick on the picture to see their ugly faces a little bit larger!\n<p> <A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>I \nwant to return to the list of questions... now!</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>What is the starting salary in investment \nbanking for an analyst's position when one has a bachelors degree? \n(Economics)</H2>\n</A> I start out looking on the EINet Galaxy search engine because I know \nthere are many different subjects on that page.  My guess is that I will \nbe heading for Business Administration studies in school, so I can follow \nthat link.  And so I find the large heading <A \nHREF=\"http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Business-and-Commerce/\nBusiness-Administration/Financial-Aspects.html\">Financial Aspects</A> and \nI decide that the financial aspects of my degree are what I am worrying \nabout.  If it is one thing that I've learned, it's that looking around \nthoroughly on each separate page is very beneficial, so I look around and \nfind the title <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cob.ohio-state.edu/dept/fin/osujobs.htm\">Jobs in \nFinance</a> and I can look at something like <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cob.ohio-state.edu/dept/fin/ib.htm\">Investment \nBanking</A> if I want, and I do.  When looking under the salaries link I \nfind, <B>WOW</B>, that with only a bachelors degree the starting salaries \nrange from $40,000 to $80,000 after bonus.  And I learn that the numbers \njust keep growing with each new degree and position.\n <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Hey, \nlet's go back to the list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>What is Australia's rank as a gold producer in \nthe world? (Economics)</H2>\n<IMG SRC=\"http://www.csu.edu.au/links/australia.gif\">\n</A> If I am interested in going where the surf is good, the beaches are \nnice and the gold is plentiful, where would I look?  Well, I've heard \nthat the surf and the beaches in <B>Australia</B> are the ideal, but what \nabout the gold situation?  As usual, there are many ways to get \ninformation, but I figured that an Australian University page, found at \nrandom, might \nbe able to help.  It took a couple of tries to find one that might be \nsuitable, but I finally found Charles Sturt University, though I figure \nthat the same thing can be found on many other servers.  There is a link \nthere for <A HREF=\"http://www.csu.edu.au/education/australia.html\">Guide \nto Australia</A> where lots of information can be found, one of them \nbeing information on <A \nHREF=\"http://www.csu.edu.au/australia/defat/mining.html\">mining</A>.  \nThere I find that Australia is the third largest gold producer after \nSouth Africa and the United States.  Thrilling, eh?\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to the list of questions, please.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>Since I live by the ocean now, I want to get \na sailboat.  What is some information on Snark Boats, the company\nthat I have heard so much about?</H2>\n</A> I found this server called CyberWharf, closely related to the \nCybermall, which has a large listing of companies and much more \ninformation.  What I really want to see of all of this information is \nthe <A HREF=\"http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/sailfl1.htm\"> Sailboat \nBuilders and Sailmakers</A>.  Of course, they have much information on \nthe Company by the name of Snark that I want to find out about.  \n<p><img border=1 hspace=5 vspace=5 align=left \nsrc=\"http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/snark/snrk001b.gif\"><br>\nNow these look like some pretty nice boats to me!  But that is not all \nthat I can go by.  I think that I want to look at <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/snark/snarkdat.htm#Sunflower\"> \nThe Sunflower 3.3</A> in more detail.  Once I do all of this, I can make \nup my mind as to the right size boat. In this case, the boat is 11 feet \nlong, can seat up to 2 people, and has a Sail Area of 55 sq. ft.  \nThis comes complete with sail, daggerboard, rudder, riggings and \nfitting.  Mast, spar and boom are aluminum and the wooden parts are \nmarine varnished.  The wooden sail seat is optional.  I guess that I will \nhave to go to a local dealer to get a quote on prices.<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>I say boy, I want the list of questions!.</it></a>\n\n</UL>\nAnd one last look at the Scott Phillips <A \nHREF=\"/u3/ea/eaaa074/ics.1c/hot.w2.html\">hotlist</A>\n <hr>\nSubmitted February 15, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
