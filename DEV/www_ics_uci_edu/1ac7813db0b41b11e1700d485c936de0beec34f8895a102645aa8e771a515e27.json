Di Giacomo, W. Didimo, G. Liotta, and S.K. Wismath<br>\nSpeaker: Jeremy Yu Meng\n</h2>\n\nThis paper introduces and studies the concept of a curve\nembedding of a planar graph. Let <I>C</I> be the family of 2D curves described\nby concave functions and let <I>G</I> be a planar graph. A curve embedding\nof <I>G</I> is a linear ordering of the vertices of <I>G</I> such that there exists a\ncrossing-free 2D drawing of <I>G</I> where the vertices are constrained to be\non any given curve of <I>C</I> and the edges are drawn as polylines with at\nmost one bend. We prove that every planar graph has a curve embedding\nwhich can be computed in linear time. Further we present applications\nof the concept of curve embedding to upward drawings and point-set\nconstrained drawings.\n<P>\nFrom WG 2003\n29th Workshop on Graph Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science,\nLNCS 2880\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
