Mount</h2>\n<h2>Speaker: Jordan Jorgensen</h2>\n\n<p>\nAbstract: We analyze the performance of simple algorithms for matching two planar \npoint sets under rigid transformations so as to minimize the directed Hausdorff distance \nbetween the sets. This is a well studied problem in computational geometry. Goodrich, \nMitchell, and Orletsky presented a very simple approximation algorithm for this problem, \nwhich computes transformations based on aligning pairs of points. They showed that \ntheir algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of 4. We introduce a modification to their \nalgorithm, which is based on aligning midpoints rather than endpoints. This modification \nhas the same simplicity and running time as theirs, and we show that it achieves a better \napproximation ratio of roughly 3.14. We also analyze the approximation ratio in terms of \na instance-specific parameter that is based on the ratio between diameter of the pattern \nset to the optimum Hausdorff distance. We show that as this ratio increases (as is \ncommon in practical applications) the approximation ratio approaches 3 in the limit. We \nalso investigate the performance of the algorithm by Goodrich et al. as a function of this \nratio, and present nearly matching lower bounds on the approximation ratios of both \nalgorithms.\n</p>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
