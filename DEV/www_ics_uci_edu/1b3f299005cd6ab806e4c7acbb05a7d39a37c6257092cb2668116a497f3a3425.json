A server which stores Dublin Core metadata for\n   its content may wish to make the metadata available as WebDAV \n   properties; to forestall the emergence of incompatible ways to \n   provide this functionality, this document defines a mapping from \n   Dublin Core element labels into WebDAV property names.\n\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALLNOT\", \n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and\"OPTIONAL\" in this \n   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTS] .\n\n4 Mapping\n\n   The approach taken in this mapping is to leverage the RDF encoding \n\nStracke                                                       [Page 1]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT            Dublin Core in WebDAV              June 8, 1999\n\n   ([DC-RDF]) of Dublin Core. An [RDF] document encoding Dublin Core \n   data would look something like this:\n\n      <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n      <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\" \n      xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/\" \n      xmlns:dcq=\"http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/\">\n      <rdf:Description about=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt\">\n      <dc:creator>\n      <rdf:Description>\n      <rdf:value>Crocker, David</rdf:value>\n      <dcq:creatorType \n      rdf:resource=\"http://purl.org/dc/schema/LastnameFirstname#\"/>\n      </rdf:Description>\n      </dc:creator>\n      </rdf:Description>\n      </rdf:RDF>\n\n   The mapping defined here works by identifying each subelement of \n   <rdf:Description> with a single WebDAV property. Since WebDAV \n   properties are expressed as XML elements ([XML]), using XML \n   namespaces ([XMLNS]) allow different groups to define sets of \n   properties without interfering with each other, the mapping is direct\n   and one-to-one. In this case, the namespaces being used are \n   <URI:http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/>, \n   <URI:http://purl.org/dc/qualifiers/1.0/>, and \n   <URI:http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>, as specified in \n   [RDF] and [DC-RDF]. To obtain the Dublin Core creator for the \n   resource <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt>, a WebDAV client would \n   issue a PROPFIND method to the resource, requesting the dc:creator \n   property:\n\n      PROPFIND /rfc/rfc822.txt HTTP/1.1\n      Host: www.ietf.org\n      Content-type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\n      Content-Length: xxxx\n\n      <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n      <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n      <D:prop xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/\">\n      <dc:creator/>\n      </D:prop>\n      </D:propfind>\n\n   The response to the request would provide the <dc:creator> element, \n   and all its contents, just as in the RDF document above.\n\n4.1 Correspondences\n\n   The following table illustrates the relationship between [DUBLIN] \n   element names and [WEBDAV] property names. The dc: prefix is assumed \n   to be mapped to the namespace http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/.\n\n\nStracke                                                       [Page 2]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT            Dublin Core in WebDAV              June 8, 1999\n\n   Dublin Core element    WebDAV property\n\n   DC.Title               dc:title       \n   DC.Creator             dc:creator     \n   DC.Subject             dc:subject     \n   DC.Description         dc:description \n   DC.Publisher           dc:publisher   \n   DC.Contributor         dc:contributor \n   DC.Date                dc:date        \n   DC.Type                dc:type        \n   DC.Format              dc:format      \n   DC.Identifier          dc:identifier  \n   DC.Source              dc:source      \n   DC.Language            dc:language    \n   DC.Relation            dc:relation    \n   DC.Coverage            dc:coverage    \n   DC.Rights              dc:rights      \n\n4.2 Abbreviated Syntax\n\n   The Abbreviated Syntax of [DC-RDF] MUST NOT be used in this encoding,\n   since it requires packing separate properties into a single XML \n   element, which is incompatible with the DAV property model.\n\n4.3 Complications\n\n   A previous version of this document had some difficulties with \n   advanced sections of the Dublin Core model. This version addresses \n   these problems, but it may be useful to enumerate them for future \n   reference.\n\n4.3.1 Multivalued Properties\n\n   A WebDAV property can occur on a resource only once, while a content \n   item may bear more than one instance of a Dublin Core element. The \n   previous document defined an ad hoc XML syntax for listing multiple \n   values, which drew criticism from people who wanted more general \n   multivalued property support for WebDAV. This document is able to \n   sidestep the problem because Dublin Core now has its own solution, \n   and it is not necessary to create a new one. In the above example, if\n   RFC-822 had multiple authors, the <dc:creator> element might contain \n   an <rdf:Bag> element containing <rdf:li> elements.\n\n4.3.2 Qualification (Subelements)\n\n   When the previous document was written, some members of the Dublin \n   Core group had plans to support more structure in their metadata, but\n   had not yet defined a syntax for it. At this time, the debate over \n   subelements is still not fully resolved, but the syntax in the RDF \n   encding has been established: to add extra data on a dc: element, one\n   nests a dcq: element within it, as a qualifier, as in the \n   <dcq:creatorType> element in the RDF example above.\n\n\nStracke                                                       [Page 3]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT            Dublin Core in WebDAV              June 8, 1999\n\n5 Examples\n\n   The examples in this section are based on Example 14 of [DC-RDF], \n   showing how [WEBDAV] would be used to set and get the properties \n   presented there. (Note that non-ASCII characters in Example 14 have \n   been elided for the sake of the ASCII Internet-Draft format.)\n\n5.1 Set with PROPPATCH\n\n5.1.1 Request\n\n      PROPPATCH /metadata/resources/dc/datamodel/WD-dc-rdf/ HTTP/1.1\n      Host: www.ukoln.ac.uk\n      Content-type: text/xml\n      Content-length: xxxx\n\n      <?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\n      <D:propertyupdate\n      xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"\n      xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/\"\n      >\n      <D:set>\n      <D:prop>\n      <rdf:Description \n      rdf:about=\"http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/metadata/resources/dc/datamodel/\n      WD-dc-rdf/\">\n      <dc:title>\n      <rdf:Alt>\n      <rdf:li xml:lang=\"en\">Guidance on expressing the Dublin Core \n      within the Resource Description Framework (RDF)</rdf:li>\n      <rdf:li xml:lang=\"no\">Veiledning a uttrykke Dublin Core innenfor \n      rammen av Resource Description Framework (RDF)</rdf:li>\n      <rdf:li xml:lang=\"de\">Dublin Core in RDF: Eine Anleitung</rdf:li>\n      </rdf:Alt>\n      </dc:title>\n      <dc:creator>\n      <rdf:Bag>\n      <rdf:li>Eric Miller</rdf:li>\n      <rdf:li>Paul Miller</rdf:li>\n      <rdf:li>Dan Brickley</rdf:li>\n      </rdf:Bag>\n      </dc:creator>\n      <dc:description>\n      <rdf:Alt>\n      <rdf:li xml:lang=\"en\">This document describes work carried out by \n      the Data Model Working Group of the Dublin Core Metadata \n      Initiative.
