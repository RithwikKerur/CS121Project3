The overall grade\nwill be determined 10% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and\n40% from the final.  However, you must pass the final exam in order to pass \nthe class.\nGroup work on homeworks is permitted; each\nstudent should turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks.\nHomeworks will usually be assigned in lecture on Fridays and due\nat the ICS distribution center on the following Friday (by\nwhenever the distribution center closes that day).\nLate homework assignments will not be accepted.\nHomeworks will not be graded due to the limited grading resources\navailable in ICS at this time; instead, you will receive a score based\nonly on the number of homeworks turned in.\nHomework submissions that do not appear to be serious attempts at\nsolving the assigned problems will not be counted.\nExams will be graded normally, however.\nStudents are strongly encouraged to do all homeworks;\nour experience is that failure to do homeworks has been\nstrongly correlated with failure to pass this class.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Exam policy.</b>\nSeveral students have been caught cheating in recent offerings of 161,\nmost often due to similarity of their answers.\nIn addition to the procedures of the\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html\">ICS \nCheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a \nfailing grade in the class.\nIn addition, students will not be allowed to get up and leave during the\nlast ten minutes of each exam; instead, they must remain quietly in\ntheir seats until all exams have been collected.<br>\n<br>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Text.</b> The course text will be \"Algorithm Design\" by\nGoodrich and Tamassia.  Students are expected to own a copy and\nto read the relevant chapters and sections.  The homework problems\nwill be assigned from this text.\n<br><br>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Course times.</b> The course meets Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,\n3:00 - 3:50 in IERF 101.\nThere are three discussion sections, each of\nwhich will meet once a week for fifty minutes,\non Wednesdays at 4:00, 5:00, and 6:00.\nAll students\nshould be enrolled both in the lecture and in one of the discussion\nsections.  Attendance at the discussion section is not mandatory, but\nis strongly encouraged.  At the discussion sections, teaching assistants\nwill go over homework and midterm solutions, give additional examples of\ntopics covered in the lecture, and be available to answer questions.\n<br><br></li>\n\n<li><b>Instructors and office hours.</b> The course will be taught\nby <a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> (office hours: MW 4-5, Thu 2-3).\nWe also have two TAs: Nodari Sitchinava (office hours TTh 11-12 in the\nICS trailers, room 127A) and Michael Nelson (office\nhours Tues 2-3 and Fri 9-10 in CS 458F)\nand one reader (wangn@uci.edu).\n<br><br></li>\n\n<li><b>Bulletin board.</b>\nThe <a href=\"news:ics.161\">ics.161</a> bulletin board\nis available for course news and announcements.\nIf you have a question about the course that you feel would\nbe of general interest or wish to post anonymously, ics.161 is also\nappropriate for that.\n<br><br></li>\n\n<li><b>Drop policy.</b>\nAll drop requests should be\nperformed by giving Prof. Eppstein a completely filled-in drop card,\nat office hours or by appointment.  Drop cards will not be\nsigned or accepted at the lecture.\nDrops will only be accepted during the first two weeks of class.\nOnce your drop card has been signed, further coursework from you will\nnot be graded.<br><br>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Add policy.</b>\nAll students who wish to add must give\nProf. Eppstein a filled-in add card by Friday,\nApril 8, at office hours or by appointment.\nAdd cards will not be\nsigned or accepted at the lecture.\nI will then verify your eligibility\nfor the course with the ICS student affairs office, and as space and\nteaching assistance availability\npermits will announce availability of signed add cards on the ics.161\nbulletin board.\nAdd requests will be prioritized in the following order: (1) students who \nwere incorrectly dropped because of faulty prerequisite checks, (2) ICS\nor CE students who will be able to graduate this quarter if they pass\n161, and who have not taken the class previously, and (3) ICS or CE\nstudents who will be able\nto graduate this quarter if they pass 161, and have previously taken but \nnot passed the course.  Adds will only be accepted for\nstudents meeting the course prerequisites.\nIf you intend to add, you should turn in all homework assignments\nas they are due; I expect to complete all adds prior to the first\nmidterm.<br><br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Tentative Schedule</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Apr. 4: Intro/review [Goodrich &amp; Tamassia, chapter 1]</li>\n<li>Apr. 6-8: Comparison sorting [2.4,4.1,4.3]<br>\nHomework due Friday, April 15: R-1.7, R-4.4, R-4.5, R-4.9, C-4.10</li>\n<li>Apr. 11-13-15: Integer sorting & selection; lower bounds [4.4-4.7]<br>\nHomework due Friday, April 22: R-4.14, R-4.16, R-4.17, R-4.18</li>\n<li>Apr. 18-20: Divide and conquer, master theorem, integer arithmetic,\n<a href=\"http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/news/primality.html\">primality testing</a>\n[5.2,10.1]</li>\n<li>Apr. 22: FIRST MIDTERM</li>\n<li>Apr. 25-27-29: Dynamic programming [5.3]<br>\nHomework due May 6: R-5.9, R-5.11, R-5.12, C-5.10</li>\n<li>May 2-4-6: Graph representation, traversal, ordering [6]<br>\nHomework due Friday, May 13: R-6.4, R-6.6, R-6.7, R-6.10</li>\n<li>May 9-11: Shortest paths 7.1,7.2</li>\n<li>May 13-16: Minimum spanning trees [7.3]<br>\nHomework due Friday, May 20: R-7.1, C-7.2, C-7.3</li>\n<li>May 18-20-23-25: String algorithms [9]<br>\nHomework due Friday, May 27: R-7.8, R-7.9, R-9.1, R-9.4</li>\n<li>May 30: Memorial day holiday</li>\n<li>May 27: SECOND MIDTERM</li>\n<li>Jun. 1-3: Computational Geometry [12]<br>\nHomework due Friday, June 10: C-12.11, C-12.15, C-12.18</li>\n<li>Jun 6-8-10: NP-completeness and approximation [13]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Wiki</h2>\n\nSome of the students enrolled in this offering of ICS 161 have set up an\n<a href=\"http://education.wikicities.com/wiki/UCI_ICS_161_S2005_Eppstein\">ICS 161 Wiki</a>\ncontaining course notes, homework assignments, wikipedia links, and\nother useful information.
