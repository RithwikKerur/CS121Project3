By the end of last week (Friday, January 16), I had received 23 petitions from students wanting to add the course, plus another five from students who wanted to switch sections.  After some drops last week, and my agreement to admit a total of 226 students into the course (113 per section) instead of 225, there were seven available seats for adds as I sat down to deal with the first round of enrollments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Things you need to know:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><i>If you appear on the change list below.</i>  You indicated with an enrollment petition that you wanted to change sections.  Everyone who submitted such a petition was granted his/her request.  It's important for me to note that if you asked to change sections and I granted your request, I gave another student your seat in your current section.  Thus, you are now <i>required</i> to change sections by the end of this week (Friday, January 23).  See me with an already-filled-out change card and I'll gladly sign it.  If you fail to get your section changed by the end of this week, I'll give your seat in your new section to someone else and require you to drop the course.  (I hate to be so bureaucratic about this, but I have a finite number of seats and a large number of students wanting them.)</li>\r\n  <li><i>If you appear on the add list below.</i>  Seven students have been authorized to add the course as of today.  See me with an already-filled-out add card and I'll gladly sign it.  The add card must be submitted by Friday, January 23 in order for you to add the course.  Anyone on the list who has not added by then will be replaced by someone else in the second round of adds!</li>\r\n  <li><i>If you do not appear on the add list below.</i>  I intend to do one more round of adds after the end of the second week, since students are still eligible to drop the course until then.  If I get additional drops this week (or if students who are authorized to add this week fail to get their add card signed), I will authorize more students to add next week.  After that, I will no longer be able to add new students, as the course will be full.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Students who must now change sections</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IDSuffix lists the last four digits of your UCI ID#.</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"normal\">\r\n  <tr class=\"top\"><td>IDSuffix</td><td>New section</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>1924</td><td>Sec. 1</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>2016</td><td>Sec. 2</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>2099</td><td>Sec. 1</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>3059</td><td>Sec. 1</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>4424</td><td>Sec. 1</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Students who are now authorized to add</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"normal\">\r\n  <tr class=\"top\"><td>IDSuffix</td><td>Section</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>2689</td><td>Sec. 2</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>3219</td><td>Sec. 1</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>3837</td><td>Sec. 2</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>4088</td><td>Sec. 2</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>5560</td><td>Sec. 2</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>6779</td><td>Sec. 1</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td>8220</td><td>Sec. 2</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
