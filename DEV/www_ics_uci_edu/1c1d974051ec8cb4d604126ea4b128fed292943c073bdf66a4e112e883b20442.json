The Web page should contain\nthe information listed below. <B>Send the URL (not the file) for the page\nto Rijit as indicated above.</B> Remember to set protections for the &quot;world&quot;\nto browse your page.</P>\n\n<P><B>Team Name.</B> You may want to choose a name for your group to give\nyourselves some identity. In the past, teams have given themselves nicknames\nbased on the longer project name. Most Project names are short enough to\nserve as the team name, e.g., &quot;Java2D GEF.&quot; However, you have\nthe option to invent a name.</P>\n\n<P><B>Team Logo.</B> Create some sort of logo or placeholder for your team.</P>\n\n<P><B>Project Name.</B> The &quot;official&quot; name of the project you\nwant to bid on. This name is taken from the projects Web page.</P>\n\n<P><B>Contact Person/Client.</B> The name and email of the client, as in\nproject Web pages.</P>\n\n<P><B>Summary.</B> You should write your own one or two paragraph (about\n12 to 15 sentence) summary of the project. This summary should be in your\nown words and it should capture what you see to be salient features of\nthe project. Therefore it is not simply the summary from the project Web\npages.</P>\n\n<P><B>Team Members.</B> You should include a list of the team members,\nwith one member listed as the &quot;lead.&quot; Each name should link to\nyour individual Web page. If you are dividing responsibilities up in your\ngroup, you can choose to list responsibilities next to the names (see e.g.\nthe list of roles in the Mythical Man-Month). Of course, each team member\nshould assist with every activity in the project, but different members\nmay take the lead or the responsibility for different activities (e.g.,\ntesting, requirements, etc.).</P>\n\n<P><B>Additional Links.</B> You may include an annotated list of links\nat the end of the Web page. These will include at least a reference to\nthe appropriate projects Web page. It may include links relevant to types\nof technologies that you think you will use..</P>\n\n<P>\n<HR ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics125-FQ01/assignments/\">ICS125\nFQ01 Assignments<BR>\n</A><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles/ics125-FQ01/\">ICS125\nFQ01<BR>\n</A><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
