A spot of\ndegree zero or one forms a single site.  Degree two spots have two\nsites and degree three spots have three sites.  A degree two spot is\ncalled an \"eye spot\" if its sites are in separate regions.  If both\nits sites are in the same region, it is called a \"pier spot\".\n\nThe sites in a region that are connected to each other form a\n\"boundary.\"  We list the sites of a boundary in \"left-hand order,\"\nthe order in which a miniature robot within the region would\nencounter them walking forward along the boundary with its left hand\non the boundary.  If the boundary surrounds the region, this is\nclockwise order.  If the region surrounds the boundary, left-hand\norder is counterclockwise.\n\nElement 1: Basic position notation\n\nIn an N-spot Sprouts game, the initial N spots are numbered 1,2,...,N\nand the spots added in the course of the game are numbered starting\nat N+1.  Each boundary is written as a list of the spot numbers of\nits sites in left-hand order, starting at an arbitrary site and\nseparated by commas.  Each region is represented as a list of its\nboundaries separated by semicolons.  Finally, the region\nrepresentations are listed separated by slashes.\n\n    1--6---5             Example: This position can be written\n       |      9              1,6,8,7,4,7,3,9,3,7,8,6,5,6;2/3,9.\n       8     / \\   2\n       |     \\ /             Element 2 describes how to abbreviate\n    4--7------3                 this as 1,8,4,9t,8,5;2.\n\nElement 2: Abbreviating position notation\n\nThe position notation may be abbreviated by omitting dead spots.  If\na degree one spot has all other spots on its boundary deleted it must\nbe marked with an \"o\" to distinguish it from a degree zero spot.  Any\nregion with fewer than two live spots may be omitted, but eye spots\nlisted in only one region must be marked with a \"t\" to distinguish\nthem from degree one spots.  If the two sites of a pier spot become\nadjacent, the pier spot may be listed once, marked with a \"t\".  An\nexample of the abbreviation appears in the previous example.\n\nIt is possible to specify a move in Sprouts by providing the full\nposition after the move--in fact, the full position notation provides\na complete history of a game.  You can see this by using the position\nnotation to draw the game in pencil, then inking it in one move at a\ntime.  However, it is helpful to be able to specify a move more\nconcisely, and I describe how to do so below.\n\nElement 3: Basic move notation\n\nA move that connects spot A to spot B, creating spot C in the middle,\nis written A-C-B, perhaps with additional notations.  By convention,\nthe lower-numbered endpoint is listed first.  The direction of the\nmove, from A to B, determines one site of C as a \"left\" and the other\nas \"right\".  When listing sites in left-hand order, A is listed after\nthe left site of C and B is listed after the right site of C.  When A\nand B are the same spot, this determination is ambiguous, the left\nsite is taken to be the one accessible to other sites on A's\nboundary, if any.\n\n         ______       Example:  The position 1,3,2,4,2,3/2,4 is\n   (l)  /      \\          created  by the moves 1-3-2; 2-4-2.  The\n 1--3--2    (r) 4 (l)     first 3 refers to the right site of spot 3,\n   (r)  \\______/          and the second 3 refers to the left site.\n\nElement 4: Specifying sites for pier spots\n\nWhen an endpoint of a move is a pier spot, it is necessary to specify\nwhich site is being connected.  This is done by suffixing \".N\", where\nN is the number of the first live spot appearing after the site in\nleft-hand order.  Just as A is written on the left and B on the right\nin the move move A-C-B, the left site is C.A and the right site is\nC.B, unless A or B becomes dead after the move.  (We avoid using\ndead spots to specify sites because they would not appear in the\nabbreviated position).\n\n   (5.1)    Example: After 1-5-2; 3-6-4, there are four ways of\n 1---5---2      connecting spots 5 and 6, leading to the following\n   (5.2)        four abbreviated positions:\n                  Move  5.1-7-6.3  yields position  1,2,7,3,4,7.\n   (6.3)          Move  5.1-7-6.4  yields position  1,2,7,4,3,7.\n 3---6---4        Move  5.2-7-6.3  yields position  1,7,3,4,7,2.\n   (6.4)          Move  5.2-7-6.4  yields position  1,7,4,3,7,2.\n\nElement 5: Specifying boundary separations\n\nWhen a move connects two sites on the same boundary, the region\ncontaining the boundary is split.  All other boundaries in the\noriginal region will appear either in the region accessible from the\nleft site of the new spot or the region accessible from the right\nsite.  This separation is specified by listing the lowest numbered\nlive spot from each of the boundaries to go into one of the regions.\nA list of boundaries accessible to the left site is preceded with\n\"&lt;\", while a list accessible to the right site is preceded with \"&gt;\".\nIf there are no other boundaries to separate, the separation is\nwritten \"=\".\n\n   8      7     Example: After 1-6-2; 3-7-4; 1-8-2&gt;; 3-9-4&gt;1\n  / \\    / \\        the position is\n 1   2  3 5 4\n  \\ /    \\ /      1-6-2-8;3-9-4-7/1-8-2-6/3-7-4-9;5.\n   6      9\n\nElement 6: Specifying the region for double-eye-spot moves.\n\nWhen two eye spots share the same two regions, a move connecting them\nmust specify in which region the connection is made.  Since such eye\nspots appear on the same boundary in each region, they separate the\nregion as in element 5.  The separation is also used to determine\nwhich region is used, in one of the following ways:\n\n    6a. If the separation normally lists at least one boundary, the\n        listed boundary is sufficient to specify the region.\n    6b. If the separation is between at least one boundary on one\n        side and zero boundaries on the other side, the separation\n        must specify the side with at least one boundary.\n    6c. If there are no live boundaries being separated, but there is\n        at least one other live spot on the boundary being connected,\n        then the lowest numbered live spot is listed as being\n        separated, as if it were on a separate boundary, along with\n        which side the separation is on.\n    6d. If there are no live spots in the region being separated,\n        then the separation is written \"=\".\n\n   _        Examples: After 1-3-1&gt; the position is 1,3;2/1,3.\n  / \\   2      A move between eye spots 1 and 3 must be written\n 1---3         1-4-3&gt;2 or 1-4-3= as in elements 6b and 6d,\n               respectively.\n\n       3       In the game 1-4-2; 2-5-3; 1-6-5.2 the position is\n       |       1,4,2,3,6/1,6,2,4.  A move between eye spots 4 and 6\n   6---5       is written 4-7-6&gt;1 for connection in the region\n  /    |       containing 3, or 4-7-6&lt;1 for the smaller region, as\n 1--4--2       in element 6c.\n\nElement 7: Equivalent representations for a position\n\nA position representation can be changed in three ways with no\neffect on the position represented:\n\n    7a: Changing which site is used as the start of a boundary\n        or boundaries,\n    7b: Changing the order in which boundaries are listed in a \n        region or regions, and\n    7c: Changing the order in which the regions are listed.\n\nThere are two other changes that can be made, provided that we do\nnot need to interpret the notation of moves made in the position:\n\n    7d: Permuting the numbers used to denote the spots, and\n    7e: Reversing the order of all boundaries in a region or\n        regions.\n\nIf a position is changed in these ways, any further moves must be\ntranslated by performing a corresponding permutation to the spot\nnumbers and exchanging \"&gt;\" with \"&lt;\" in the reversed regions (except\nwhere a move connects a point to itself, as in element 3.\n\nI believe these elements are a complete description of a notation\nsystem for Sprouts, but it is quite possible I have overlooked\nsomething.

Ghosts are invisible\n(but are in the background) of the following argument.\n\n(5) A \"survivor\" is a live spot in an exhausted position.\n\nArgument:\n\n(1) A single move always changes the total number of cannibals by an\nodd number.  For instance, a move from a cannibal to a cannibal\nchanges the total number of cannibals by -1.\n\n(2) Thus a player who fields a position with an odd number of\ncannibals cannot field a position with an even number of cannibals.\n\n(3) Since survivors are cannibals, a player who fields a position with\nan odd number of cannibals cannot field an exhausted position if there\nare an even number of survivors.\n\n(4) Likewise, a player who fields a position with an even number of\ncannibals will win if there are an odd number of survivors.\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
