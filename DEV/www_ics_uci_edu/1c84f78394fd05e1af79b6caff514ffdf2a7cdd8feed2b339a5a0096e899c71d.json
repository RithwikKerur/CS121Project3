We present novel hashing schemes that can be\nemployed to limit the ability of adversarial nodes to carry out attacks.\nWhen used in conjunction with previous work, our scheme yields a\ndistributed hash table that behaves near-optimally in the absence of\nmalicious nodes and efficiently in the presence of malicious nodes.\nThis talk is based on the joint work of Michael T. Goodrich, Michael J. \nNelson, Jonathan Z. Sun, Roberto Tamassia, and Nikos Triandopoulos.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
