INTRODUCTION</H2>\n\n\t<P>The arrival of massive on-line computer networks of information \nexchange such as the Internet has given rise to a whole range of unique issues and controversies \nrelated to privacy, censorship, and the law. For instance, difficulties in \nmaintaining privacy has led to a restructuring in the means by which \ngovernmental bodies collect data on their citizens, one of \nthe most notable cases perpetuated by the FBI. This in turn has generated \nconcern and resistance over the extent in which government surveillance \nand intrusion on the Internet is \npossible and/or advisable.  Also, while attempts to censor have tended \nto center around topics related to sex, pornography, and sexuality (which are \nall subjects  which classically fall under the legal guise of \"obscene\"), the \nimplementation of censorship and regulatory laws governing content could \nconceivably spread to the extent that they jeopardize free speech and access \nacross the board. Simultaneously, \nthe Internet has proven an especially difficult and/or problematic format on \nwhich to implement censorship laws. While computer networks have managed to \nremain relatively open and resistant to attempts at regulation, the drastic \nincrease in the use of such information retrieving, accessing, and relaying \ntools such as the World Wide Web virtually ensures that these issues will \nincrease in the forseeable future(not to mention the issues related to the \nWeb's use of detailed graphics and images). </P>\n\t<P>The on-line community certainly has not reacted \npassively to attempts at regulation and surveillance. Groups, such as the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.eff.org/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</A> and the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.eff.org/CAF/\">Computers and Academic Freedom \nArchive</A>, have popped up to monitor attempts at regulation, taking a \ndecidedly \"civil liberties\" stance against any form of infringements upon \nopen and free speech. In addition, newly emergent issues never cease to pop up, including \nthe current bill in the US Congress (<A \nHREF=\"http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-bill.html>Senate Bill \nS314</A>). How these \nissues are resolved and at what cost guarantees to be some of the most \nrecurrent and hotly debated topics around as \nwe increasingly come to \ndepend on the computer information networks as a primary source of information retrieval \ndissemination.</P>\n\n\t \n<H2> II. PRIVACY AND THE LAW</H2>\n\n<P>Electronic information exchange raises new issues related to the \nprivacy of such transmissions. The ever burgeoning spector of information \ntechnologies raises grave concerns over the ability of governmental \nagencies to gather unwarranted information on its citizens. Governments have \nany number of justifications for the collection of data on its citizens, \nincluding census taking, taxation, law enforcement, national service \nprograms, etc. That such justifications could easily be bended to serve \nmore or destructive purposes hardly needs mention (a brief review of \nthe <A HREF=\"http://naic.nasa.gov/fbi/FBI_homepage.html\">FBI</A>'s \nhistory of covert intelligence activities would lay testament to this). \nThus \nthe question becomes, to what extent should governmental access to \npersonal information on the Internet be allowed? What \nmeasures/precations need be taken to deter abusive governmental intrusion of \nthe on-line community?</P>\n<P>The increasing computerization of public records and databases adds an entirely new element to these debates. For \nexample, the ever advanced technology available to the public also \nimplies that government bodies have ever advancing ways of collecting \ndata and covert means of accessing it. One example is the proposals for \n\"smart highways\" which enable the constant tracking of all automobiles on \nthe road. Given examples like these, concern over surveillance are \nfairly obvious.</P>                              \n<P>Laws regarding privacy and surveillance on computerized networks such \nas the Internet vary extensively across states and among service \nproviders. There have been some \nfairly limited attempts at passing federal laws which protect personal \ninformation on computer networks, \nincluding the Privacy Act of 1974, but these are outdated and lack in \nuniform clarity as to percisely what they protect. Additionally, current \nlaw is not tailored to \nthe unique dynamics involved in the massive informational interchange \ninherent to a system like the Internet. Possibly the most evident \nconcern is with the use of <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Privacy/privacy_anonymity.faq\">electronic \nmail devises</A> and on-line chat \nservices such as <A HREF=\"http://thales.nmia.com/irc.html\">IRC</A>. \nAnonymity in such exchanges is far from assured, \nand current law makes little provisions toward thwarting \nvulnerability to surveillance. \n<P> Rather than curb surveillance capabilities, a powerful attempt recently \narose that aimed at greatly  \nabating government surveillance. In 1992 the FBI attempted to \nimplement the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/communications/wiretap/coalition_paper.txt\"> \n\"Digital \nTelephony\" legislation</A>. This was a response by the FBI and other law \nenforcement agencies to a concern that changes in telecommunications \ntechnology would jeopardize their ability to conduct \"authorized \nwiretapping\". The proposal mandated that all providers of \nelectronic communications services provide law enforcement officials the \n\"capability and capacity\" to survey and intercept on-line transmissions, \nwithout \nthe detection of the user. This is essentially an attempt to modernize \nthe <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/communications/wiretap/electronic_commun_privacy_act.txt\">wiretap \nstatues</A> passed in 1968 and 1986 by Congress. The danger in \nsuch proposals is in  instilling arcane monitoring techniques to \nthe dynamically open and constantly evolving Internet. In addition to its \noppressively broad scope, the legislation had provisions that would have \nallowed law enforcement agencies to force providers to use certain \ntechnologies that are of most use to their data collecting purposes. In \nthis \nsense then, the law would go far beyond the provisions set out by the \nwiretap laws already in existence by actually <i>requiring</i> providers \nto adopt a certain standard of tools. The wire-tap \nbill unleashed a <A HREF=\"http://www.cpsr.org/dox/wiretap.html\">torrent \nof responses</A>  within the on-line community, as many objected to the \nnegative ramifications such a broadly scoped surveillance bill would \ninflict. Nevertheless, on October 7, 1994, the bill finally\npassed Congress,  but in a much modified form. The final draft, entitled \nthe <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Legislation/Bills_by_name/Old/digital_telephony_94_passage_statement.eff\">Edwards/Leahy \nDigital Telephony Legislation</A>  does place functional \ndesign requirements on providers but does not allow for heightened \nauthority to conduct wiretapping operations.</P>\n\n<H2>III. CENSORSHIP, ACCESS, AND THE LAW</H2>\n<P> Whereas the concern for the on-line community regarding privacy \nissues has revolved around <i>protection from</i> undo governmental \nintrusion, a related though distinct issue of free and open <i>access to</i> \ninformational services has surrounded the issue of censorship on the \nInternet. The Internet has proven particularly resistant to attempts at \nregulating its contents, due in part to the \"ethos\" of its users \nwho tend to regard free and open access at upmost importance(an \ninteresting editorial on <A \nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.uiuc.edu/0R0-6427-/UI/DI/1994/November/18/fabricol.txt\">limiting \nInternet freedom</A> addresses this point at length). Probably more \ntelling however is the difficulty in actually banning materials from it. \nThe Internet is one of the most easily accessible and exploitable\ninformation forums in existence. The advent of the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.psych.indiana.edu/www.html\">World Wide Web</A> \nmakes putting information on the Net all the easier, and thus all the \nmore resistant to attempts at regulation.</P>\n<P> Probably the most recurrent issue related to censorship both on the Net \nand in general is <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/CAF/cafuiuc.html#Suppression\">topics \ninvolving sex</A>. \nOne of the most controversial of the sex related  sources on the Internet is a \nnewsgroup \nnamed \"alt.sex\". This newsgroup carries an extensive array of erotic \nessays, \nsexually explicit stories, sex related discussion groups, and\nissues of \nsexuality in general. By far the most targeted for censorship out of \nthese is stories which \ndescribe in often lurid and graphic detail tales of sexual violence, \ndegradation of women, \nand even explicit depictions of rape and other forms of forced and/or \ncoerced sex. To exasperate the tension arisen by such material even \nfurther, the World Wide Web's multimedia \ncapabilities allows users to pull up pornographic pictures in full \ncolor. \nThese means that virtually anyone old enough to understand how to operate a Web \nbrowser can have access to such material. It quickly becomes apparent that \nthe safeguards to exposure to \npornographic material available at a store (age of purchase laws) are no \nlonger applicable in this new format.</P>\n  \n<P>In addition, concern has increased over a number of issues relating to \nvarious debates over the distinction between the terms <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/CAF/faq/censorship-and-harassment.html\">\"offensive and \nharrassment\"</A>. Generally, merely <i>offensive</i> material is \nprotected under free speech, whereas <i>harrassment</i> constitutes a \nhate crime punishable by law. Where one draws the line between these \ntwo is a constant source of ambiguity. Likewise, debate over what falls \nunder such laws as \nthe UW Rule banning discriminatory speech (or \"hate speech\") from \nacademic settings have been increased. For example, should University \nofficials take punitive action upon repeatedly racist jokes and/or \nstories over their computer networks? Given that practically anyone can post \nanything they want on \nthe Net, (thereby eliminating safeguards on validity of claims, speech \ncodes, etc.) should there be greater attention paid to limiting access \nand/or ban certain types of transmissions above and beyond current \ncensorship law?</P>\n<P> So far, policies regarding \"suppression and expression\" vary among service \nproviders, but in all are fairly limited. The hesitance at implementing \nregulatory laws to govern network transmission is reflective of the difficulty \nin both deciding what constitutes material to be censored and how to go about \nit in an environment such as the Internet. Attempts at controlling \ntransmissions have been fairly unsuccessful, and come at the risk of academic \nopenness and the free access so many Net users have come to value. This is not \nto say censorship is unheard of on the Internet, as a quick look at a document \nwhich lists <A HREF=\"ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/banned.1992\">banned materials in \n1992</A> at major academic institutions bears out.</P>\n<P> Possibly the most comprehensive attempt to impose a regulatory measure on \nmaterial on the Internet is a current proposal under consideration in the U.S. \nCongress, the <A HREF=\"http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-bill.html\">Senate \nBill S. 314</A>. This bill, introduced by Senators Exon and Gorton, \nattempts to \nimpose current FCC regulations(which govern radio and television \nprogramming and \ncontent) regarding \"obscene and indecent\" material to all networked electronic \ncommunication outlets. Entitled the \"Communications Decency Act of 1995\", \nif passed the \nact would incur criminal penalty to providers who allowed such \nmaterial to appear on their network. Thus, the bill would require service \nproviders to screen nearly all of the transmissions occurring on their \nnetworks in order to root out any possible \"offenders\". In an <A \nHREF=\"http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-appendix.html\">analysis by \nthe Center for Democracy and Technology</A>, the authors point out that \n\"service providers would be forced to closely monitor every private \ncommunication, electronic mail message, public forum, mailing list, and file archive carried by or\navailable on their network, a proposition which poses a substantial\nthreat to the freedom of speech and privacy rights of all American\ncitizens\".</P> \n<P>What becomes interesting here is the collusion of censorship issues \nwith surveillance/privacy issues. Should S. 314 pass, not only would it \nentail the censorship of material which fell under the rubric of the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/hr1004.html\">1934 \nCommunications Act</A>(specifically, Section 223, that prevents minors \naccess to \"indecent\" audiotext), it would also force service providers to \nconstantly \nmonitor the types of transmissions occurring at all times. In effect, the \nbill seems to be another example of a broadly scoped and poorly drafted \nattempt too apply out-dated  methods of surveillance and regulation to \ntechnology designed in large part to counteract such restrictionists. The \nInternet relys on the speedy and open transfer of information. Given the \ndrain already on providers just to offer basic access, a bill such as \nS. 314would \nunduly afflict both provider and user with impractical guidelines and \nregulations.</P> \n\n\n<H2>IV. ORGANIZATIONS DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES</H2>\n\n<P>Numerous organizations have popped up since the Internet's inception to \nmonitor and advocate positions regarding issues of privacy and censorship \non computer networks. Two of the most prominent of these groups are the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.eff.org/\">Electronic Frontier Foundation(EFF)</A> and \n<A HREF=\"http://www.eff.org/CAF/\">Computers and Academic Freedom(CAF)</A>. \nThe EFF deals especially with issues involving Constitutional rights of the  First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, and \"democratic values\".\nTheir stated goals include establishing <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Legal/\">new laws</A>, <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/OP/op2.0\">policies for network \nproviders</A>, a <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/OP/op2_0.summary\">\"national \ninformation infrastructure\"</A>, and providing a format \nin which \"all citizens\" have <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Issues/Activism/\">input</A> in \nthe \"information age\". They also \nsponsor legal cases that involve violations of users' civil liberties \nand maintain useful archives of legislation, cases, and incidences of \ncensorship. The group also puts out position papers on related issues and \nimpending legislation that effects the on-line community.\n<P>Computers and Academic Freedom provide an incredibly extensive array \nof papers dealing in issues of privacy, access, and censorship, as well \nas maintaining vast archives of case work. Their <A \nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/CAF/faq/\">FAQ page</A> is an excellent quick \nreference to some of the major debates and questions regarding \ntelecommunication regulation.</P>\n\n<H2>V. CONCLUSION</H2>\n<P> In no way should this brief overview of issues of censorship and \nprivacy be construed as exhaustive. Literally thousands of individual \ncases have sprung up. This paper has attempted to deal with some of the \nmajor trends regarding these topics, some of the overlying concerns for the \non-line community, current issues and bills that threaten to alter how \nthe Internet operates, and lastly, two of the best sources to go to in \norder to keep abreast on any crucial developments. Privacy and \ncensorship on the Net will undoubtedly remain prevalent and hotly \ncontested in the future. As long as one remains an engaged user of the Net, \none should not fail to stay informed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<H2>Five distinct sites</H2>\n<OL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.eff.org/\">http://www.eff.org/</A><BR>\nThis is the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an organization dealing with\nprivacy, access and censorship.\n\n\n<LI><A HREF=\" http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/\"> http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/</A><BR>\n This takes you to a document entilted Preserve, Protect and Defend the\nInternet!, and specifically provides a great deal of information on the\nSenate Bill S 314.

This will include attempts at surveillance and wiretap by\nthe FBI, issues of  censorship and the law, and various instances of \ninfringements upon freedom of expression over the information lines. To\nwhat extent does government have a right and/or duty to regulate what\ngoes on over the Internet? In contrast, to what extent can we view this as a \ndirect violation of the guiding \"ethic\" of the on-line community to both open    \nand free expression? In general, what are the limits to freedom of\ninformation exchange, and what types of topics are most often dealt with\nalong these lines? These are some of the major issues I will wish to\npursue in my research. Specifically, I will also cover the recent bill in\nCongress to regulate this and the issues surrounding the legislation.\n\n\n\n<hr>\n<!--------===========CUT===HERE=========-------------->\nSubmitted March 16, 1995\nfor <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
