However, this was not the original\nconception of the Web; as early as 1990, a prototype Web editor and\nbrowser was operational on the Next platform, demonstrating how Web\ncontent could be read and written. Unfortunately, most of the world\nnever saw this editor/browser, instead developing their view of the\nWeb from the widely distributed text-based line mode browser. When\nNCSA Mosaic was developed, it improved the line mode browser by adding\na graphical user interface and inline images, but had no provision for\nediting. As Mosaic 2.4 reached critical mass in 1993-4,\n\"publish/browse\" became the dominant model for the Web.\n\n<P>However, the original view of the Web as a readable and writable\ncollaborative medium was not lost. In 1995 two browser/editor products\nwere released: NaviPress by NaviSoft and FrontPage by Vermeer. These\nproducts began developing a market for authoring tools which allow a\nuser to edit HyperText Markup Language (HTML) pages remotely,\ntaking advantage of the ability to work at a distance over the\nInternet. In early 1996, NaviSoft and Vermeer were purchased by\nAmerica Online and Microsoft respectively, presaging major corporate\ninterest in Web distributed authoring technology. In 1995-96, Netscape\nreleased Navigator Gold, a Web browser/editor tool, with the ability\nto publish pages to a remote Web server. 1996-7 also saw the release\nof Web-integrated word processors, with Microsoft Word 97, Lotus\nWordPro 97, and Corel WordPerfect 7 all having HTML editing and remote\npublishing capability.\n\n<P>In this setting, an ad-hoc collection of people interested in\nremote authoring (now known as the WEBDAV working group) met first at\nthe WWW4 conference in December, 1995, and then next at America Online\nin June, 1996. Comprised of developers working on remote authoring\ntools, and people generally interested in extending the Web for\nauthoring, this group identified key issues encountered in writing\nthese authoring tools. The group also found that there was a pressing\nneed to develop standard extensions to the HyperText Transfer Protocol\n(HTTP) for the following capabilities:\n\n<ul>\n<li><i>Metadata.</i> The ability to create, remove, and query\ninformation about Web pages, such as its author, creation date,\netc. Also, the ability to link pages of any media type to related\npages.\n\n<li><i>Name space management.</i> The ability to copy and move Web\npages, and to receive a listing of pages at a particular hierarchy\nlevel (like a directory listing in a file system).\n\n<li><i>Overwrite prevention.</i> The ability to keep more than one\nperson from working on a document at the same time. This prevents the\n\"lost update problem\" in which modifications are lost as first one\nauthor, then another writes their changes without merging the other\nauthor's changes.\n\n<li><i>Version management.</i> The ability to store important\nrevisions of a document for later retrieval. Version management can\nalso support collaboration by allowing two or more authors to work on\nthe same document in parallel tracks.\n</ul>\n\n<P>From its inception, the WEBDAV group has been working steadily to\nproduce an interoperability specification which defines HTTP methods\nand their semantics for the above capabilities. Work in this direction\nhas focused on three documents, a <i>scenarios document</i>, which\ngives a series of short descriptions of how distributed authoring and\nversioning functionality can be used, typically from an end-user\nperspective, a <i>requirements document</i>, which describes the\nhigh-level functional requirements for distributed authoring and\nversioning, including rationale, and a <i>protocol specification</i>,\nwhich describes new HTTP methods, headers, request bodies, and\nresponse bodies, to implement the distributed authoring and versioning\nrequirements.  On March 20, 1997, the Internet Engineering Steering\nGroup (IESG) of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) approved\nthe charter of the WEBDAV Working Group, making WEBDAV an official\nworking group in the Applications Area.  WEBDAV is working\ncooperatively with the World Wide Web Consortium, which provides\ntechnical assistance and help contacting interested people within the\nWeb community.\n\n<P><B>Want to know more?</B>  \n<BR>\nA high-level overview of WebDAV and DASL is the article\n&quot;<A HREF=\"intro/webdav_intro.pdf\">WEBDAV:\nIETF Standard for Collaborative Authoring on the Web</A>&quot;, by Jim\nWhitehead and Meredith Wiggins, which appeared in the\nSeptember/October, 1998 issue of <I><A HREF=\"http://www.computer.org/internet/\">IEEE Internet Computing</A></I>, pages 34-40.\n</P>\n<P>Another introduction to WEBDAV appeared in <A HREF=\"http://www.computer.org/internet/\">IEEE Internet Computing</A>,\nVol. 1, No. 2, March/April 1997, in the column,\n<A HREF=\"http://dlib.computer.org/ic/books/ic1997/pdf/w2076.pdf\">Distributed\nAuthoring and Versioning</A>, by Gail Kaiser and Jim Whitehead.\n\n      <hr>\n[<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/\">WEBDAV Home\nPage</A>]\n<hr>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/\">\nJim Whitehead &lt;ejw@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nDepartment of Information and Computer Science</A><BR>\n247 ICS2 #3425<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.irvineco.com/\">\nIrvine</A>, CA  92697-3425<BR>\n</ADDRESS>\n<P>\n<!-- Created: Mon Jun  9 15:18:25 PDT 1997 -->\n<!-- hhmts start -->\nLast modified: September 18, 1998\n<!-- hhmts end -->\n</P>\n  </body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
