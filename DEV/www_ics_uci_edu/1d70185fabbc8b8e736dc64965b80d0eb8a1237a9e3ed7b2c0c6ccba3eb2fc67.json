To our knowledge, this is the first peer-\nto-peer data structure that simultaneously achieves high\nfault-tolerance, constant-sized nodes, and fast update and\nquery times for ordered data. It is a non-trivial adaptation\nof the SkipNet/skip-graph structures of Harvey et al. and\nAspnes and Shah, so as to provide fault-tolerance as these\nstructures do, but to do so using constant-sized nodes, as\nin the family tree structure of Zatloukal and Harvey. It\nsupports successor queries on a set of n items using O(log n)\nmessages with high probability, an improvement over the\nexpected O(log n) messages of the family tree.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work by Michael T.
