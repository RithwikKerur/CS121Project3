The Chechens are one of the most unpopular ethnic groups in \nRussian History.  The mainly Moslem territory is under siege by Russian \nforces attempting to win back the small territory from the rebels.  Many \ndifferent factors seem to be to blame for the uprising as well as the \nfierce attempt to squelch the insurgents.  The United Nations is not \ngetting involved other than to help refugees displaced by the heavy \nfighting find a decent supply of food and shelter, and to take the burden \noff of the good natured souls who are now supporting them.  New \ndevelopements are constantly arising in either the political forum in \nMoscow, on the battlefield in the war torn territory, or on the streets \nof Russia and the ever-changing support of the population.  Many people \nare unsure on whether they should support the fighting or oppose \nYeltsin.  It is a tough political stance to take because the motives for \nthe fighting are all questionable.  It is well known that the political\n and economic situation in Russia is very poor and is actually looked upon\n as a joke by many workers.  Yeltsin has made a\n definite stance on the issue to win \nback the territory, but the reasons why are not so clear.  Another \nthing that is unsure is the outcome and the eventual costs of the \nfighting that are sure to plague either country for many years.  \n<p><A \nHREF=\"#anchor6\">Return to \nOutline</A><p> <HR> <H4><A NAME=\"anchor2\">The Role of the United \nNations</A></H4>\n <p> The United Nations does not seem very concerned with the events that \nare transpiring in Chechnya as of now.  The concern with Bosnia and the \nSerbs is a much greater concern at this point, but it seems that with the \napparent slaughter that seems to be the goal of Russia, there would be \nsome cause for intervention or concern on the part of the United \nNations.  However, it appears that the U.N. is attempting to help the \ndisplaced Chechens who fled the country during the fierce fighting and \nassault on their capital Grozny.  <A \nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.undp.org/11/uncurr/DH\">The Daily Highlights of the \nUnited Nations</A> available on Gopher, mention Chechnya very little, and \nit apparent that they are not attempting to curb the fighing.  they are, \nhowever, making a very concentrated effort to help the refugees of the \nfighting, but as one diplomat says, \"There are tens of thousands of \npeople who need help urgently and Moscow\nrecognizes this. Yet it can't get its act together and issue visas.\"  \nThe general consensus is that the U.N. has no part in the political \nmatters of Russia, but the estimated 100,000 refugees are of great \nconcern to them.  \n<p><A HREF=\"#anchor6\">Return to Outline</A><p>\n<HR> \n<H4><A NAME=\"anchor3\">Various Views of the War</A></H4>\nThe atmosphere is constantly changing on the battlefield, as well as in \nthe Kremlin and the streets as far as the consensus of the people.  Part \nof the general attitude of the people surfaces in <A \nHREF=\"http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/friends/news/chechnya/9503/950312-2.html\">\nA Revival For Russian Dissident Chechen War Provides New Reason to\nProtest</A>, an overview of one woman's ideas which are most likely \nshared with much of the population.  Susanna Pechuro feels that the war \nwith Chechnya is a new genocide.  She was alive and protesting against \nStalin, which got her thrown in a labor camp, when he deported the \nChechens.  Now she says that Yeltsin is destroying them.  She is not \nalone in her analysis.  Much of the outside media cites evidence of major \nhuman rights breaches.  According to Voice of America, Yelena Bonner, a \nhuman rights activist, has resigned from Russia's  Human Rights  \nCommission because President Yeltsin and those around him have \nabandoned the human rights issue. The death toll, according to VOA's \nRussian correspondent Peter Collins has reached about 25,000 \n<I>civilians</I> in almost three months of fighting.  That incredible \nnumber leads many people to believe that it is a conscious effort to \ncompletely destroy the Chechen people.\n<p><A HREF=\"file://localhost/u3/ea/eaaa074/paper/article1\">Another \nview</A> is told by Professor M. Berlin in Moscow.  From talking \nto English speaking Muscovites, he has received a wide range of ideas \nconcerning the Russian involvement in Chechnya.  His initial findings \nwere that there is a feeling that there is not much in Chechnya worth \nthe loss of Russian lives, and that the incompetence displayed is all \nthe fault of Boris Yeltsin.  Berlin says \" If\nYeltsin counted on the Russian bias against Chechens (and others from \nthe \nCaucasus)\nto win public support, he miscalculated.\" Chechnya is a republic and \nmany people just don't see any real reason to be fighting a country \nin which the people \"just do crime\" according to one woman.  There is \nmuch bigotry expressed against the people of Chechnya.  This particular \nwoman also seemed to think that \"nothing is grown or manufactured in \nChechnya, and that the local oil industry \ncost\nRussia more than it produces in product.\" (Berlin) Actually many feel \nthat Chechnya should be given total independence, and expelled from the \nRussian federation. (Berlin)</p>\n<p>Yeltsin, of course, has his own reasons for the invasion of Chechnya.  \nAs Margaret Shapiro Reports in her <A \nHREF=\"http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/friends/news/chechnya/9412/941222-2.html\">\nWashington Post Article</A>, Chechnya is a Republic  \"which unilaterally\ndeclared its independence in 1991 and which Russia says has become a base for\narms dealers and gangsters.\"  Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev justified \nthe military assault on Chechnya by saying that it was prompted by the\nactivity of armed groups, which are totally intolerable in any country.\" \n(Shapiro)  The purpose, according to Yeltsin, seems to be to reestablish \norder and the local economy and not to totally destroy the Chechen people.\n<p><A HREF=\"#anchor6\">Return to Outline</A><p> \n<HR> \n<H4><A NAME=\"anchor4\">Political Motives Behind the Fighting</A></H4>\nAs stated before, it is highly possible that Yeltsin was trying to feed \noff the Russian people's dislike for the Chechen people when he decided \nto invade their small Republic, but if that was the case, then it \nbackfired badly.  Because of the tough economic situation in Russia as \nwell as the surrounding areas, it is highly possible, as reported by Kunio \nSakuma, a Soviet Union Researcher, that \"The tough stance taken by the \nYeltsin\nadministration in regard to Chechnya should keep 'regional uprisings' \nunder tentative control, but it is quite possible that regional \nauthorities will \nstart to push gradually for an expansion of their own powers.\" And it is \nalso very possible that Yeltsin feels the economies of Russia and the \nsurrounding areas would not be able to handle a full independence of \nRussia at this point.  Every economy of the area is in bad shape and \nmany people are on strike because there is no money to pay anyone.  If \nall of their resources continue to fall apart, such as the oil supply in \nChechnya, then their economic base will be completely destroyed and they \nwill inevitably slip back into the trap of communism.  \n<p>On the other side of the spectrum, Chechnya has to fight for their own \nindependence in order to finally beat what has plagued them for \ncenturies, being under the rule of an oppressive Russia.  Chechens have a \nsort of genetic distrust of Russia due to the Stalin era as well as ages \nbefore of exile and deportation.  The desire to be completely independent \nof an imperialistic nation such as Russia must be absolutely overwhelming \nfor them.  \n <p><A \nHREF=\"#anchor6\">Return to \nOutline</A></p> <HR> <H4><A NAME=\"anchor7\">Current Developments</A></H4>\n<p>My main sources of updated information are the brief but apparently \naccurate reports of Voice of America correspondents in Russia.  The <A \nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.voa.gov/11/pub/radio/newswire>newswire</A> has \nup-to-date information for the current week, but contains no archives.  \nThis week, there doesn't seem to be much action due to the take over of \nGrozny by Russian troops.  There is apparently still sniper fire and the \nsoldiers are able to get in and out of the city under cover of darkness, \nbut the battlefield is much quieter.  From the last reports of Peter \nCollins in Moscow on the Chechnya conflict, he reported that \n<UL>\n<LI>\"THE \nVILLAGE OF SAMASHKY IS A PROSPEROUS FARMING COMMUNITY  \n40 KILOMETERS WEST OF GROZNY.  IT IS ONE OF SEVERAL REMAINING  \nCHECHEN STRONGHOLDS SINCE RUSSIAN FORCES CAPTURED THE CAPITAL.\n\nSAMASHKY HAS BEEN UNDER SIEGE BY RUSSIAN ARTILLERY FOR WEEKS, AND\nNOW RUSSIAN TANKS HAVE CUT A ROAD LINKING THE VILLAGE WITH  \nREBEL-HELD TERRITORY TO THE SOUTH.\"  \n</UL>\nI have this article in my mail \narchives because it would no longer be available on-line.  The main \ncomplaints now are that Russian artillery is hitting the Chechen \nvillages, supposedly killing numerous civilians.  This is the reason that \nmany people are making a human rights issue out of the war.  Because of \nthe need for Russian troops to expose the Chechens in their home \nterritory, they must fire upon the villages that they are held up in, and \nif the  Chechen citizens have not yet been able to flee, then there \nare bound to be casualties.\n<p>\n<p> <A HREF=\"#anchor6\">Return to \nOutline</A> \n<HR> \n<H4><A NAME=\"anchor5\">Possible Outcomes</A></H4>\n<p>  One of the main statements that Yeltsin has been sure to make is \nthat he vows <A \nHREF=\"http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/friends/news/chechnya/9412/941222-2.html\">\nnot to punish the Chechens</A>.  According to Margaret Shapiro's report, \nYeltsin also claimed that the refugees will be allowed to return to their \nhomes.  Of course, this is all assuming that Russia wins.  This seems \ninevitable.  When they do win, it appears that the only way they are \ngoing to be able to maintain any sort of control over Chechnya is to put \nthem under a sort of military rule and control all aspects of their \ngovernment for a while.  But the desire for everyone is to avoid what has \nhappened to the Chechen people over their <A \nHREF=\"http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/friends/news/chechnya/9412/941218-1.html\">\nlong history</A>.  The fact is that the Chechen people have been punished \nfor their Muslim based religion, their geographical location (being in \nthe way of Russia's path to India and Syria), and their natural \nresources.  When Hitler was enacting his \"final solution\" upon the Jews, \nthe same thing was happening to the Chechen people.  Yeltsin can not let \nthat happen.  \n<p> If Chechnya miraculously pulls out a victory, they will have quite a \nstruggle with their economy being totally separate from Russia, as well \nas the obvious trouble that Russia will give them in any economic move \nthat they may make.  They respect as an independent nation will be \nnon-existent as will be an effective form of government.  Right now, it \njust seems like a no-win war.\n <p><A HREF=\"#anchor6\">Return to Outline</A><p> \n<HR>\n<H4>Some Articles</H4>\n<p> Much of the information that I have accumulated came from articles \nthat I had to mail to myself in order to preserve them, otherwise when \nthe different sights were updated, I would have lost the information.
