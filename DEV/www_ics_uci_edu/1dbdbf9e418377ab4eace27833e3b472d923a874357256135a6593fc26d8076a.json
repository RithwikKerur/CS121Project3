Define a linear order on P\nby ordering the points in the order they are illuminated by a light \nray sweeping out a circle centered at some point S not in P. I assume\nthat the ray is incident with at most one point of P at any instant.\nThe problem is to maximize the minimum of the angles subtended at S\nby consecutive points of P. I shall call such a point S a sighting point.\nThere are configurations such that such a point does not exist. Also there\nmay be several such points for a given set P. \n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:mckay@concour.CS.Concordia.CA\">mckay@concour.CS.Concordia.CA</A> (John Mckay)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Sighting point\n<B>Date:</B>           20 Apr 89 13:31:10 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   Concordia University, Montreal Quebec\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nP is a point S from which the minimum angle subtended by two\npoints of P is maximized.
