Edward remarried a widow, Rosie Cohen Eichner, that same year (she passed away April 14, 1963). He had 2 additional children with her. Edward naturalized in 1892, while living at 57 Lewis Street, in NYC. He later moved to 319 8th Street in NYC. By 1908 he resided in Boston with his wife and children.
