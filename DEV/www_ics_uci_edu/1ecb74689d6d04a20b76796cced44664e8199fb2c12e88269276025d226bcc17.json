M2 accepts any string \nwhich is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards);\nfor instance, it accepts the empty string, and the strings 0, 1, 00, 11,\n000, 010, 101, 111, 0000, 0110, 1001, and 1111.\n\n<P>(a) Show how to translate strings of zeros and ones with a finite state \nmachine, so that M1 accepts a string s if and only if M2 accepts the \ntranslation of s.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: There are many possible translations; here's a particularly\nsimple one.  Convert \"0\" to \"01\" and \"1\" to \"10\".  But if you ever see a\n\"0\" after the first \"1\", convert it and any following characters to a\n\"1\".\n\n<P><IMG SRC=\"hw5p1.gif\">\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n\n<P>(b) Does the existence of this translation show that M1 can simulate \nM2, or that M2 can simulate M1?\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: that M2 can simulate M1.\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P>(c) Do you think you can find a similar translation in the opposite \ndirection, so that M2 accepts a string s if and only if M1 accepts the \ntranslation of s?  Why or why not?\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: I don't believe a translation in the other direction exists,\nbecause the finite state machine doing the translation could not know\nwhere the middle of the string is.\n\n<P>For example suppose the machine were going to translate the input\n\"01100110\".  The first four characters \"0110\" are a palindrome, and the\nmaching doing the translation can not know (after seeing these palindromes)\nthat there are more characters left.  So, their\ntranslation should be of the form 0<sup>i</sup>1<sup>i</sup>\naccepted by M1.  Then the first five characters \"01100\" are not a palindrome,\nand the machine doing the translation should add more characters to\nthe previously output string so it is no longer of the form\n0<sup>i</sup>1<sup>i</sup>.  But once it has done that, then no matter\nwhat else is added, it is stuck with\na string that will never be accepted by M1, even though the whole string\n\"01100110\" is a palindrome.\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P>(d) If the reverse translation does not exist, what would that imply \nabout the possibility that M1 or M2 might be universal?\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nM1 is not a universal Turing machine, because there exist machines\n(namely M2) which it can't simulate.\n\n<P>We would need more information to know whether M2 is universal,\nthe translations considered so far aren't enough to tell one way or the other.\n(It turns out that M2 is not universal, but proving this would be beyond\nthe scope of this course.)\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><LI>For each of the following sets of pairs of strings,\neither solve the Post correspondence problem or explain why no solution \nexists.  (Recall that a solution is a sequence of \npairs such that the concatenation of the top strings in the pairs is equal \nto the concatenation of the bottom strings.)\n\n<P><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>\n<TR ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER>\n<TD ROWSPAN=2>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;</TD><TD>11</TD><TD \nROWSPAN=2>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>11</TD><TD \nROWSPAN=2>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>110</TD><TD ROWSPAN=2>&nbsp;}</TR>\n<TR ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER>\n<TD>101</TD><TD>11011</TD><TD>1</TD></TR></TABLE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: 110 11 110 11 = 1 101 1 11011\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>\n<TR ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER>\n<TD ROWSPAN=2>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;</TD><TD>10</TD><TD \nROWSPAN=2>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>10</TD><TD \nROWSPAN=2>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>01</TD><TD \nROWSPAN=2>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>0</TD><TD ROWSPAN=2>&nbsp;}</TR>\n<TR ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER>\n<TD>1</TD><TD>01</TD><TD>10</TD><TD>10</TD></TR></TABLE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: There is no solution.  If there were, the first pair in the\nsolution would have to be (10,1) because no other pair has matching\nfirst characters.  But after using that pair, the top string\nends with one more character (a zero) than the bottom.\nOnly one pair, (10,01), allows that zero to be matched, but it leaves\nanother zero unmatched again.  So, at each step you're forced\nto add a pair (10,01), and you can never finish this process and find a\nfinite solution.\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>\n<TR ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER>\n<TD ROWSPAN=2>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;</TD><TD>1110</TD><TD \nROWSPAN=2>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD>1</TD><TD ROWSPAN=2>&nbsp;}</TR>\n<TR ALIGN=CENTER VALIGN=CENTER>\n<TD>1</TD><TD>0111</TD></TR></TABLE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: 1110 1110 1110 1110 1 1 1 = 1 1 1 0111 0111 0111.\n\n<P>This one is pretty easy, but it shows that even when the number of\npairs in an example of the Post correspondence problem is small\n(here there are only two pairs), the length of a solution can be quite large.\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n</OL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
