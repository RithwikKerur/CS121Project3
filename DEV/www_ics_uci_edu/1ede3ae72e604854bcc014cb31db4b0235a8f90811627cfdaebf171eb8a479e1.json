They had two sons, their second one being born in 1937. In September 1939 the Wehrmacht (German army) attacked the Polish garrison on Westerplatte which controlled the entrance to the Danzig harbour. Jews were being send to concentrations camps. Aharon and other heads of household escaped on a illegal ship bound for Palestine.

Esther and her two sons stayed on in Danzig waiting for another opportunity to flee. Finally, in August 1940, they left by train and then boat.
