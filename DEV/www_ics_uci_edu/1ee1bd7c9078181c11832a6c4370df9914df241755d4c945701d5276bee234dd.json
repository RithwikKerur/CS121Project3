The Jewish \r\nCommunity in Bielsko-Bia3a decided to interest itself in this object and take \r\ncare of its appearance. They also decided to carry out a detailed inventory list\r\nof tombstones and, there fore, they contacted\r\nThe Provincial Authorities in Bielsko-Bia3a and The State Service for the \r\nPreservation of the Monuments in Bielsko-Bia3a. After the decision of the \r\nbeginning of inventory was made,\r\nThe Provincial Authorities in Bielsko-Bia3a assigned for this purpose over 2500 \r\nUS$, while\r\nThe State Service for the Preservation of the Monuments in agreement with The \r\nJewish Community, assigned a person who would carry out the inventory.\r\nThis person is Jacek Proszyk ? student of Warsaw University who knows Hebrew \r\nlanguage and has already made the inventory of about 4000 tombstones on the \r\nother five Jewish cemeteries. Mr. Proszyk began the works in June 1997 and is \r\nplanning to finish them in November 1997.\r\nThe inventory activities are follows: taking picture of the tombstone; writing \r\ndown and translating\r\na full remained Hebrew inscription; measuring the tombstone; defining the \r\nmaterial of which the tombstone was made; describing the architectonic \r\nappearance, symbols and ornamentation; matching and painting a number on the \r\ntombstone; describing the condition and conservation needs. The inventory will \r\nbe carried out by using standardised index cards of monuments and will be placed\r\nin the archives The State Service for the Preservation of the Monuments with \r\nnegatives and floppy disk containing a full record. In virtue of the inventory \r\nThe Jewish Community in Bielsko-Bia3a will be giving out certifications \r\nconfirming the existence of particular tombstones.\r\nMr. Proszyk stated that on the cemetery remained over 800 tombstones and the \r\noldest one, found until now, dated back to 1757 year.\r\n        Despite of the index cards, there will be printed an alphabetic list of\r\nsurnames and names with the date of death and the tombstone's number. It will \r\nhelp families who visit the cemetery, to find the tombs of their ancestors \r\nwithout any problem.\r\nIn spite of a great help and interest of polish authorities, the financial means\r\nare not sufficient to finish the inventory on time. Therefore, if you are \r\ninterested in hereby project,\r\nwe would like to ask for a financial support. To cover the present costs which \r\nwere borne during the inventory works, we need an amount of 500 US$.
