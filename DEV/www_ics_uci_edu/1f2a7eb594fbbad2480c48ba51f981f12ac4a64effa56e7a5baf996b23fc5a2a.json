What is sin(omega)?\n&gt;&gt;What is sin(epsilon)?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;In \"On Numbers and Games\", page 43, Conway discusses this.  His method will\n&gt;define  sin(x)  as long as |x| &lt; some finite integer.  He adds:\n&gt;\"there does not seem to be any reasonable extension enabling us to define\n&gt;any of these functions outside this 'bounded' region.\"\n&gt;\n&gt;On the other hand, his dismissing of the possibility of a \"limit\" on the\n&gt;same page is nonsense.  The usual \"epsilon-delta\" definition, where now\n&gt;epsilon and delta are positive surreals makes perfectly good sense.\n&gt;In order for a definition of sin(x) to be reasonable, it should be\n&gt;twice differentiable (using these limits to define \"differentiable\") and equal\n&gt;to the negative of its second derivative, and agree with the usual sin(x) for\n&gt;real x.  Is there such a function?  Is it unique?\n&gt;\n\nActually, there is a ``reasonable'' extention of all elementary\nfunctions for all surreal and surcomplexes ( surcomplexes are defined\njust by adjoining i = sqrt(-1) ) .\n\nThis comes from a ``reasonable'' definition of integrating a\ndifferential equation, the trouble being there is no general nice\ntheory for this, but it works fine in the relevant particular cases.\n\nIn this way, we get definitions of log, exp, sin, etc.\nThese definitions will be recursive, in the same spirit as the\ndefinitions of multiplication, division and the like.\nAs some examples:\n\nexp(\\omega) = (\\omega)^(\\omega)\n\n( The first exp being the ``analytic'' exp, and the right hand side\nis the Cantor-ordinal-style definition of (\\omega)^x )\n\nexp(i* \\omega) = 1\n\nand therefore\n\nsin(\\omega) = 0\n\nAs to the idea of bringing derivatives into the game, it doesn't really\nwork, roughly because the class of surreals is ``disconnected'',\nunlike the reals. This causes the existence of ``gaps''.\nThe following function is therefore ``C\\infnty'':\n\nf(x) = 0 , for x &lt; (gap); f(x) = 1 , for x &gt; (gap)\n\nThe epsilon-delta definition of limit is of course consistent, but not\nvery interesting.  Your idea of how to extend sine is *very*\n``non-unique''.\n\nBy the way, I learned this stuff from Conway ( the original creator of\nthis theory ).  His book ``Games and Numbers'' is an excellent introduction,\nbut this material is not covered there nor do I know any references.\n\nAs a last remark for those ignorant about what surreal numbers are,\nthey are a Big extention of the real numbers, including infinities\nof several sizes ( all ordinals and cardinals are there ).\n\n-- \n                    Nicolau Corcao Saldanha\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:nick@phoenix.Princeton.EDU\">nick@phoenix.Princeton.EDU</a> (Nicolau C Saldanha)\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     sci.math\n<b>Subject:</b>        Surreal numbers.\n<b>Summary:</b>        About exp, sin, log, etc.\n<b>Date:</b>           27 Apr 88 17:44:53 GMT\n<b>Organization:</b>   Princeton University, NJ\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n&gt;&gt; Actually, there is a ``reasonable'' extention of all elementary\n&gt;&gt; functions for all surreal and surcomplexes ( surcomplexes are defined\n&gt;&gt; just by adjoining i = sqrt(-1) ) .\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; exp(i* \\omega) = 1\n&gt;&gt; and therefore\n&gt;&gt; sin(\\omega) = 0\n&gt;\n&gt;I'd like to see this \"reasonable\" definition; it looks to me like\n&gt;you are either implicitly or explicitly bringing some form of summation\n&gt;in (C_1 sum, perhaps?).  I personally think no \"reasonable\" extension\n&gt;of sine to the non-finite surreals exists; however, my definition\n&gt;of what is \"reasonable\" does not appear (or have to) agree with yours.\n\nUnfortunately, I know of no written reference to this material.\nI will do my best to reproduce here what I learned from Conway.\n\nBut first some warnings:\n\n- There will be NO talk about continuity or differentiability of \n  surreal functions.  In fact, this approach seems inadequate to\n  me, due to the existence of gaps in the ``surreal line''.\n\n- Notice that series can NOT be added using epsilon-delta deffinitions\n  since that would make all non-trivial series diverge by falling\n  into a gap.  For instance, we would not have 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 +... = 1,\n  since 1 - 1/omega is still larger than any partial sum.\n  When we write such things as 1 + omega^(-1) + omega^(-2) + ...\n  as the Cantor-Conway normal form of a surreal number, this ``series''\n  is NOT to be understood in the epsilon-delta sense, lest we get a\n  divergent series.\n\n  ( By the way, 0.999... = 1 for the surreals ( since it holds for the\n    reals ) in the ``only'' meaningful sense the expressions have;\n    again, epsilon-delta definitions are out. )\n\n- This does not use explicitly any form of summation like Cesaro's;\n  nor implicitly, as far as I can tell ( I could be wrong ).  \n\n- This DOES use the technique of defining things inductively, defining\n  x by means of x_L and x_R.  This follows the same spirit as the\n  definitions of x + y, x * y, 1/x and the like.\n\nAnd now a most crucial warning:\n\n- The ( usual ) extentional notion of a function is NOT adequate here.\n  Two functions assuming the same values at each and every surreal number\n  must be considered DIFFERENT if the left and right options are not the\n  same.  As an example, the functions:\n\n        f(x) = {|};\n\n  and\n\n        g(x) = { g(x_L) - 1 | g(x_R) + 1 };\n\n  are both constant equal zero.  Usually, we would say that they are the\n  same function  ---  this is the extentional notion of what a function\n  is: a function is known if its extention, i.e., the values it assumes,\n  are known.  Here, however, we have to adopt a radically different\n  point of view: in order to know a function, we have to know how it is\n  defined, and different definitions give different functions even if\n  the values coincide.  In this sense, f and g are DIFFERENT.\n\n  An other way of looking at the situation, less radical but less\n  satisfactory, is to think of functions as having ``good'' and ``bad''\n  definitions.  The above definition of f is probably ``good'', but\n  g is almost certanly ``bad''.\n\n  This is means we have to be careful about certain things we usually\n  take for granted.  For instance, in a minute we will be defining log\n  as the integral of 1/x.  In order to do this, the following definition\n  of 1/x is not satisfactory:\n\n        1/x = y     iff     xy = 1;\n\n  We now need a recursive, ``constructive'' definition of the form:\n\n        1/x = { ( stuff depending on x, x_L and x_R ) |\n            ( other stuff ) };\n\n  such a definition is possible ( but not very easy ) to obtain.\n\n  Another danger: once we have log, we can't really invert it to get\n  exp: that would give us the values of exp, but not a definition we\n  could use later if we want to use exp to get new functions.\n\nNow for the real action. We will adopt the convention:\n\n    f(x) = { f_L(x,x_L,x_R) | f_R(x,x_L,x_R) };\n\nWhat follows is a definition of integration.\n\n$\n        \\int_a^b f(t) dt = \n\n    {\n        \\int_a^{b_L} f(t) dt + \\intd_{b_L}^b {f_L}(t) dt ,      \n        \\int_a^{b_R} f(t) dt + \\intd_{b_R}^b {f_R}(t) dt ,      \n        \\int_{a_R}^b f(t) dt + \\intd_a^{a_R} {f_L}(t) dt ,      \n        \\int_{a_L}^b f(t) dt + \\intd_a^{a_L} {f_R}(t) dt \n    |       \n        \\int_a^{b_L} f(t) dt + \\intd_{b_L}^b {f_R}(t) dt ,      \n        \\int_a^{b_R} f(t) dt + \\intd_{b_R}^b {f_L}(t) dt ,      \n        \\int_{a_R}^b f(t) dt + \\intd_a^{a_R} {f_R}(t) dt ,      \n        \\int_{a_L}^b f(t) dt + \\intd_a^{a_L} {f_L}(t) dt \n    }\n$\n\nI used \\TEX notation for integrals, subscripts and superscripts.\n``\\intd'' should be written as an integral sign with a capital `D'\nover it, in the middle.  It means direct integration, which means\ndo not chop the domain into pieces.  Notice that some integrations\nin the above definition will go from right to left, which means you\nhave to do the usual change of signs.\n\nSo now you know what log is! You define:\n\n    log(x) = \\int_1^x 1/t dt;\n\nThis definition is good for any positive surreal number and satisfies\nall the usual properties.\n\nA similar definition can be found for the ``solution of the differential\nequation''\n\n    dy/dt = g(t,y);\n\n( Notice we are not *really* talking about derivatives )\n\nfrom which definitions of exp , sin and cos can be obtained.\n\nI will write down the definition later if someone wants me to, but I \nthink it is obvious if you understand the above definition of\nintegration.\n\nI am not really sure of this, but I think gamma, bessel, zeta and\nother functions can be done about as easily.\n\nExercise: Prove the Riemann Hypothesis for the surcomplex numbers.\n                        ( :-] )\n\nIntuitively, however, it is relatively easy to see how to define\ntrigonometric functions for all surreals. Just say that TWOPI\nis a period in the following surreal sense:\n\n        sin( x + TWOPI*n ) = sin(x);\n\nfor any surreal x and any n in the class Oz of surreal integers.\n\n( Definition:\n\n    n is in Oz iff n = { n-1 | n+1 }        )\n\nThe above definitions have this property.  Notice that omega/TWOPI\nis an integer, and therefore omega is a period.\n\nVery roughly, the reason this works is the following: up to day omega\n( exclusive ) you have been working only with finite numbers.  When\nthe time comes to define cos(omega) and sin(omega) you still have NO\ninformation about their values.  What you do is of course pick the\nsimplest coherent answer ( this is what you do all the time with\nsurreal numbers ), and this is of course\ncos(omega) = 1 and sin(omega) = 0.\n\nBy the same reasoning, \n\n        cos(omega^r) = 1,\n        sin(omega^r) = 0;\n\nfor any positive surreal number r.\n( This is Cantor's exponentiation, not the analytic one )\n\nBy the way, there seems to be someone in Rutgers who is very interested\nin this stuff.  This someone may want to talk about this more directly.\nSend e-mail or we might talk by telephone sometime.\n\n-- \n                    Nicolau Corcao Saldanha\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href= \n\"mailto:gae@osupyr.mast.ohio-state.edu\">gae@osupyr.mast.ohio-state.edu</a> (Gerald Edgar)\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     sci.math\n<b>Subject:</b>        Re: Surreal Numbers\n<b>Date:</b>           27 Apr 88 12:19:20 GMT\n<b>Organization:</b>   The Ohio State University, Dept. of Math.\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nIn article &lt;2681@phoenix.Princeton.EDU&gt; <a href= \n\"mailto:nick@phoenix.Princeton.EDU\">nick@phoenix.Princeton.EDU</a> (Nicolau C Saldanha) writes:\n&gt;limits are not very good for surreals: the sequence a(n) = 1 - 0.1^n\n&gt;does NOT converge to 1 *in the surreals* with the usual epsilon-delta\n&gt;definition ( try epsilon equal to any infinitesimal, say 1/omega ).\n&gt;\nIf epsilon is an infinitesimal, of course n must be infinite.
