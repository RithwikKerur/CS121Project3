The mailing list is the final\narbiter of consensus on any issue.  Note also, that the revised\nBindings Protocol specification, and Redirect References \nprotocol  produced as a result of this conference call will also \nbe subject to review by the mailing list. ***\n\nBindings protocol issues:\n\nGeoff Clemm read some language for delete on bindings.  Discussed\nintroducing an UNBIND method.  Some concern over the \"mixed mode\"\ncase, where say collections are not bindable, but non-collection\nresources are. Geoff will send some proposed language out on this.\n\nIssue 7 (Yaron5.3Huh?): Agreed that Geoff's new language, in\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2000JanMar/0392.html,\nwill be proposed as a substitute for the current language.  Major\nchange is to bulletize existing text, spelling out the existing text\nmore clearly.  No change to issue 8, since we feel this will be clear\nafter the change to 5.3.\n\nDiscussion on feedback from Roy on the nature of resources.  Then\ndiscussed the dav:resourceid, whch seems to be his last major concern.\nDiscussed having a check for equivalence method, and having an\nidentifier for the set of URLs mapped to a particular resource.  Also\ndiscussed having a URN instead of the dav:resourceid.  Discussed\nwhether the property should be required.  Agreed to have a URN instead\nof a dav:resourceid, this will be accessible in a property, which is a\nSHOULD implement, not a MUST (due to filesystem implementation such as\nWebRFM), as well as a separate method that returns a boolean, yes/no,\nfor two URLs mapping/not mapping to the same resource.\n\nDiscussion on whether the bindings property should be called the\nmappings property. Concern that the \"bindings\" name on the bound-to\nresource might suggest that the individual resource holds the state of\nthe bindings, rather than the collection.  Thus, some name like\n\"binder\", or \"bindings-to\" might be more appropriate. Geoff will\nsubmit some name ideas for this.\n\nRedirect References protocol:\n\nIssue #1: Discussion over whether redirect resources should or should\nnot have bodies.  There don't appear to be compelling reasons for\nhaving this capability.  It does add complexity to the protocol, and\nto implementations. So, agreement that a redirect reference MUST NOT\nhave a body.\n\nAgreement to Yaron's proposal that Redirect Resources should be\nauthorable on non-WebDAV servers, by non-WebDAV clients.\n\nIssue #1A: Issue goes away, since MKRESOURCE will be replaced by\nMKREF.\n\nIssue #2: Use policy from Binding protocol for listing status codes.\n\nIssue #3: Yes, change caching to MUST NOT cache response from MKREF/MKRESOURCE.\n\nIssue #4, 5: Not relevant once we switch to MKREF.\n\nIssue #6: Need to add rationale for why we use relative URLs.  Server\nis required to store it as a relative URL.  Server MUST NOT change the\nrelative URL during a MOVE.\n\nRaises the issue of needing separate methods for getting the value of\na reference, and modifying the value of a reference.  Tentatively\nagreed on REFGET, REFSET (but noone likes these too much).\n\nIssue #7, 8, 9: Agreed that we will remove cross references between\nspecs.  Also will remove any mention of other specifications, since\nthis is now intended to be a standalone specification.  Will expand\ndiscussion of redirect references.  Agreed to move notational\nconventions after the introduction.\n\nIssue #10: Will use \"revealing private locations\" instead.\n\nIssue #11: Will continue to follow IETF rules, but will try to produce\na nicely formatted specification as well for review.\n\nIssue #12: Agreed, although these paragraphs will end up being changed\ndue to the move to make this a standalone specification.\n\nIssue #13: Accepted change.\n\nIssue #14: Agreement that we won't discuss bindings at all in the\nredirect references specification.\n\nIssue #15: Agreement that we won't mention Direct Reference Resources\nin the specification.  Probably also means that the definition of\nReference goes away as well.\n\nSome discussion of whether to allow authoring of other than 302\nredirects. 303, 304, and 305 don't seem to make sense for remote\nauthoring.  303 is intended for POST output. 304 is for conditional\nGET requests.  305 says to use a proxy to access a resource (though\nperhaps this would be useful to author).  300 would involve sending\nthe multiple choices when the resource was created, and would\ncomplicate MKREF.\n\nNext week's teleconference: Tuesday at 11-1 Pacific.\n\n*** End of teleconference ***", "encoding": "ascii"}
