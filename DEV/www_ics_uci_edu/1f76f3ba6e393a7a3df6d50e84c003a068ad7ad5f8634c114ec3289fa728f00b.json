We&#39;ve allowed two\nweeks for this assignment so you have more flexibility to plan around the\nThanksgiving holiday, but this assignment is somewhat larger and more open-ended\nthan the others, so don&#39;t look at it as a week&#39;s vacation.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B> This assignment will also\ngive you practice with boolean searches, help you recognize good typographic\ndesign, good software user interfaces, and effective presentation graphics.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part I:  Boolean Searches</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>For this part of the homework, use the &quot;Advanced\nSearch&quot; feature of the AltaVista search engine (</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.altavista.com\">www.altavista.com</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>)\nto formulate boolean searches.  You should start by reading the Help page\nthere.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  Formulate a boolean search to\nfind information that will help you calculate the probability of each of\nthe following events:</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A person being struck by lightning.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A person dying in an earthquake.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A person dying in an automobile accident.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A person dying of influenza.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>For each event, print out or write down the\nsearch queries you used, the pages where you found the information, and\nyour estimate of the probability (showing how you arrived at the figure--both\nyour calculations and the sources of the numbers you used).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  Compare the probabilities you\nestimated above with the probability of wining the SuperLotto jackpot.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part II:  User Interface</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B>  Pick two application programs,\nones you use regularly, that don&#39;t work as well as they should from\na user interface perspective.  Describe their shortcomings and how you would\nimprove them.  Also give, if you can, the reasons why the software might\nwork as it currently does.  (Is it intended for a different audience than\npeople like you?  Would fixing it be too hard technically?)  Consult with\nyour TA or instructor on this if you like.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(b)  </B>Find three examples, on the Web\nor in print, of documents that violate the principles of good typography\ndescribed in class and on the handout.  Choose documents that violate a\nvariety of the principles as egregiously as possible.  Print or photocopy\nthe documents, annotating them with the violations and your suggestions\nfor improving them.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part III:  Presentation Graphics</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B> A broad range of data about UCI\nis available at <A HREF=\"http://www.oas.uci.edu/\">http://www.oas.uci.edu/</A>.\n Most of this data appears in table form; how would you present it graphically?\n From the UCI data available from this page, locate three different sets\nof data:\n<BR>\n-- One that would be most effectively shown in a pie chart\n<BR>\n-- One that would be most effectively shown in a line chart\n<BR>\n-- One that would be most effectively shown as a bar chart.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(a.1)  </B>For each of the three sets,\nprint out the page containing the data (if there&#39;s more than a page\nor two, just print the first two pages) and give a sentence describing why\nthe chart type you&#39;ve chosen is effective for that data.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(a.2)</B>  For one of the three sets (your\nchoice), copy the data out of the web page, paste it into Excel, clean it\nup as necessary, and actually produce the chart.  Make your chart as clear\nand effective as possible.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  Find an example, on the Web or\nin print media, of particularly bad information display.  Turn in a copy\nalong with your critique, describing all the ways in which it is misleading\nor unclear or incomplete.  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(c)</B>  Edward Tufte criticizes the user\ninterface of most software for devoting too little of the screen area to\nactual content (as opposed to borders, decoration, controls, and so on).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Find two different application programs on\nthe lab machines, one that&#39;s particularly bad about devoting space to\ncontent and one that&#39;s particularly good.  (Consider just the part of\nthe screen that the application uses--its main window, typically.  Don&#39;t\ncount the task bar and other things displayed by Windows.)  Print a screen\nshot of each, indicating which is bad and which is good about devoting space\nto content.  These don&#39;t have to be applications that you&#39;ve used\nbefore; you just need to start them up and see how much space is devoted\nto content. </FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>What to turn in:</B>  Turn in a printed\ndocument with answers, clearly labeled, to all the questions raised above.\n Include the illustrations and samples we specified.</FONT></P>\n<BR><BR>\n<P>\n<FONT SIZE=1>Written by David G.
