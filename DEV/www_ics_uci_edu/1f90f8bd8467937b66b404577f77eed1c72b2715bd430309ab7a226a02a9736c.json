Some workshop participants that I spoke to were surprised to learn that despite living in North America I don't live on its plate, and that the boundary with the Pacific plate (on which I live) passes inland. It is spanned by multiple bridges, most of which are more useful than this one.\n<h5>Taken Thursday, June 23, 2016, 06:16:54PM.\nOriginal image size: 5312x2988, 1.8Mb<br>\nTechnical details: SM-N910V, 1/175s@ F2.2, ISO 40, 23/5mm<br>\nPS CS5 Lens correct -2.5 Hor-10, Color 0:-5:-10, Levels 0:1.05:225, USM 20:10</h5>\n</div></body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
