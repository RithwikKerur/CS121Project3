The algorithm is a combination of several\n  different algorithms, each for a different $m$ vs. $n$ trade-off. For\n  the case of $m = \\Theta(n^{1.5})$ the running time is $O(n^{2.47})$,\n  just barely below $mn = \\Theta(n^{2.5})$. In this paper we simplify\n  the previous algorithm using new algorithmic ideas and achieve an\n  improved running time of $\\tilde O(\\min(m^{7/6} n^{2/3}, m^{3/4}\n  n^{5/4 + o(1)}, m^{2/3} n^{4/3+o(1)} + m^{3/7} n^{12/7+o(1)}))$. This\n  gives, e.g., $O(n^{2.36})$ for the notorious case $m =\n  \\Theta(n^{1.5})$. We obtain the same upper bounds for the problem of\n  maintaining the strongly connected components of a directed graph\n  undergoing edge deletions. Our algorithms are correct with high\n  probabililty against an oblivious adversary.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.03856\">a paper by\nMonika Henzinger, Sebastian Krinninger, and Danupon Nanongkai</a> from\nICALP 2015)\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
