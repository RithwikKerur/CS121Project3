There were 14 meeting participants, including members\nof the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) HyperText Transfer\nProtocol (HTTP) Working Group, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),\nthe document management community, software configuration management\ncompanies, distributed web authoring tool vendors and researchers,\nand the academic hypertext versioning community.  The main objective\nof this meeting was to provide a forum where people interested\nin fostering interoperability between distributed web authoring\napplications could meet, exchange information about the current\nstate of the art and practice, identify key interoperability issues,\nand formulate an agenda for achieving interoperability.\n</P>\n\n<P>\nThe meeting began with a presentation by Jim Whitehead, U.C. Irvine\non the history of distributed authoring on the WWW, on the purpose\nof the distributed authoring working group, and on the purpose\nof the Working Group on Versioning and Configuration Management\nof World Wide Web Content.  Ron Fein, Microsoft, next gave a presentation\non collaborative authoring and WWW features in Microsoft Word.\n A presentation by Henrik Frystyk Nielsen, W3C, on distributed\nauthoring and his vision of a unified PUT model, finished the\nmorning session. The afternoon began with a presentation by Dave\nLong, America Online, on AOLpress and AOLserver, which was followed\nby a presentation by Andy Schulert, Microsoft, on FrontPage. \nWhitehead next led discussion on the goal of the working group,\nthe sponsorship of the working group, and criteria for completion.\n At the end of the day, the group discussed what they considered\nto be key interoperability issues, and developed a list of activities\nand deliverables to be produced by the working group.\n</P>\n\n<P>\n<B>Key Results</B>\n</P>\n\n<OL>\n\n<LI>The working group adopted as its goal: Enable distributed\nweb authoring tools to be broadly interoperable.\n\n<LI>Create a task-oriented list of scenarios which interoperable\ndistributed authoring tools should be able to perform.  Keith\nDawson, Atria, is the editor of this document.\n\n<LI>Create a list which collates the &quot;key functionality&quot;\namong AOLpress/AOLserver, FrontPage, Word, as well as other distributed\nauthoring tools.  Dave Long, America Online, is the editor of\nthis document.\n\n</OL>\n\n\n<P>\nThe working group also identified some areas for future work:\n</P>\n\n<OL>\n\n<LI>Criteria for completion of the group's work were discussed,\nand need to be clearly described in writing.\n\n<LI>The working group was tentatively interested in seeking sponsorship\nby the W3C. However, before the group is officially sponsored,\nmembers needs to know the intellectual property rights implications\nof such sponsorship.\n\n<LI>There should be a reinvestigation of work previously performed\nby Murray Maloney on standard LINK REL and REV tags.\n\n<LI>There should be an investigation by the versioning and configuration\nmanagement group into the utility of entity tags (etags) for performing\nversioning.\n\n</OL>\n\n<P>\n\nDetailed meeting notes, a list of participants, a final agenda\nfor the meeting, and slides from the meeting are available at\nURL:<BR>\n<BR>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/sanmateo/\" ><B>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/sanmateo/</B></A><BR>\n<BR>\n\nFinally, the working group would like to thank Dave Long of America\nOnline for arranging the conference room at AOL Productions, and\nfor his in-meeting support.
