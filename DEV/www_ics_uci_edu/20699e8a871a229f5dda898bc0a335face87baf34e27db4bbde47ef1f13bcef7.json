Richardson, Stephanie Leif Aha, and Leon J. Osterweil in\n<i>Proceedings of the ACM SIGSoft 89: Third Symposium on Software Testing,\nAnalysis and Verification</i>,\npages 219-228, Keywest, December 1989.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nIntegration of multiple testing techniques is required to demonstrate \nhigh quality of software.  Technique integration has four basic goals: \nreduced development costs, incremental testing capabilities, extensive \nerror detection, and cost-effective application. We are experimenting with\nthe use of process programming as a mechanism for integrating testing \ntechniques. Having set out to develop a process that provides adequate \ncoverage and comprehensive fault detection, we proposed synergistic use \nof DataFlow testing and Relay to achieve all four goals. We developed a\ntesting process program much as we would develop a software product from \nrequirements through design to implementation and evaluation. We found \nprocess programming to be effective for explicitly integrating the \ntechniques and achieving the desired synergism. Used in this way, process \nprogramming also mitigates many of the other problems that plague \ntesting in the software development process.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:39:25 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
