While the President of the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/\">United \nStates</A> is said to hold the world's most powerful office, he and the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/EOP/First_Lady/html/HILLARY_Bio.html\"> \nFirst Lady</A> also get to be the residents of the prestigious <A \nHREF=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/\">White \nHouse</A>. Accordingly, the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Family/html/Clintons_First_Year.html\">President</A> \nand <A HREF=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/EOP/OVP/html/Bio.html\">Vice-President</A> \nare the only public officials chosen by the entire \nnational electorate. The presidency has evolved into the focal point and \nenergizing force in the American political system. If Presidents are of \ngreat consequence in the scheme of things, so too must be the way we go \nabout choosing them.<P> \nMost of the delegates to the <A \nHREF=\"ftp://ftp.senate.gov/committee/Dem-Policy/general/dpc.html\">Democratic \n</A>and <A \nHREF=\"ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/ko/kosborn/www/contract.html\">Republican</A> \nconventions are selected in the presidential primaries, in which the \nvoters go to the polls and <A HREF=\"http://www.oclc.org/VoteSmart/lwv/pvstxt.htm\">vote</A> for their preferred candidate. This was \npromoted around the turn of the century by reformers who wanted to take \nnominations out of the hands of the party bosses and let the people vote \nfor the candidate of their choice.<P>\nAmong the democracies of the world, the U.S. stands alone in \naccording its citizens a significant role in determining who their choices \nshall be for the highest office in the land. There are many great \nadvantages of the way we go about selecting our Democratic and <A \nHREF=\"http://www.umr.edu/~sears/primary/main.html\">Republican \npresidential nominees</A>:<P>\n<OL>\n<LI>it is the most open and participatory \nprocess for selecting party leaders anywhere in the democratic world\n<LI>provides more \nminority representation\n<LI>gives outside candidates a chance \n<LI>most importantly, it represents the only system that the American people \ntoday are willing to accept<P>\n</OL>\n<H2>Critiques About The Selection Process</H2>\nAt various points throughout political history, the \nPresidential nomination process has been subject to changes designed to \nrender it more open to popular participation. \nBut one of the consequences of the reforms of the 1970's on the presidential \nnomination process is that there is an increase in out-party contenders \nas well as for the more challenges to Presidential incumbents. Some \ncritics argue that the reforms have made an incumbent President more \nvulnerable to challenge, and consequently, he is forced to divert \nenergies from more weighty matters of governing and focus attention on \nsecuring renomination. \n<A HREF=\"http://http2.sils.umich.edu/FordLibrary/DayInTheLife.html\">Gerald \nFord</A>, for example, claims that in 1976 he \nwas compelled to devote 20 percent of his time to his bid for the \nRepublican nomination.<P>\nAnother criticism of the nomination process is that it has become \nso long and arduous that many able individuals are discouraged from even \nentering the race and does not bring forward the most qualified \ncandidates. In every selection since 1972 the complaint that \"surely we \ncan do better than this\" has been widely voiced with respect to the \nnominees of one or both of the parties. Throughout the 1988 nomination \ncycle, the press called attention to the \"lightweight\" quality of the \nDemocratic contenders by dubbing them \"the seven dwarfs\".<P>\nAs the number of primaries grew, however, so did the burden of \ncampaigning, for candidates were compelled to take their case to a much \nwider audience. In describing his schedule for just one week of his 1972 \nbid for the Presidential nomination, Senator Edmund Muskie testified to \nthe frenzied pace of the President-by-primary process: \"The previous week \nI'd been down to <A \nHREF=\"http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/florida/\">Florida</A>, \nthen I flew to <A HREF=\"http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/idaho/\">Idaho</A>, \nthen I flew to <A HREF=\"http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/california/\"> \nCalifornia</A>, then I flew back to <A \nHREF=\"http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/district_of_columbia/\">\nD.C</A> to vote in the Senate, and I flew back to California, and then I flew into <A \nHREF=\"http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/new_hampshire/\">New Hampshire</A>.\"<P>\nMoreover, it is also important to note that the demands of the \nprimary process over the last decades have actually increased because \ncircumstances require candidates to prepare for it much earlier. The \nnecessity for these early declarations had been occasioned primarily by \nthree factors:\n<OL>\n<LI>the proliferation of primaries\n<LI>the increased importance of the early primaries\n<LI>the 1974 campaign finance reforms requiring a \ncandidate to raise $1,000 in each of twenty states to qualify for partial \npublic financing- an undertaking which requires elaborate planning and \norganization<P>\n</OL>\nThe influence of early contests in the delegate selection process \nhas also been enhanced by a development not directly related to the \nreforms, namely increased media attention. Critics argue that the system \ngives too much power to the media. They contend that media has replaced \nthe party bosses as the new kingsmakers. Deciding who has the momentum at \nany given moment, the press readily labels candidates as winners and \nlosers.<P>\nConsequently, the states of <A \nHREF=\"http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/iowa/\">Iowa</A> \nand <A HREF=\"http://www.plymouth.edu/new-hampshire/nh-home.html\">New \nHampshire</A> receive even \nextreme amount of media coverage due to the fact that they are the first \nstate caucus and primary respectively. This was encouraged by the Democratic \nparty's decision to exempt these two states from complying with the March to \nJune time frame for selecting delegates. That these early events can exert \ninfluence out of proportion to their importance in the greater scheme of \nthings is illustrated by the case of New Hampshire. It contains less than \n1 percent of the nation's population but plays an extremely key part in \nwho gets the parties nomination. New Hampshire's importance can be \nillustrated by the fact that no one has been elected President since 1952 \nwithout first having won the state's presidential primary. Any election \nresult in a state of New Hampshire scarcely justifies elevating a \ncandidate to front-runner status, along with the increase in money and \nexposure that typically comes with it.<P>\nMany critics maintain that while a nominating process heavily \nladen with primaries gives the appearance of being more democratic than \nthe old system, in fact it is not. In the words of Newton Minow:\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nPresidential primaries were designed to take the nomination away \nfrom the party bosses in the back room and to give the decisions to the \nvoters. But they haven't worked out that way. Instead, the current \nversion of primaries turns the decisions over to a new kind of boss. \nToday a small, unrepresentative handful of activists often concerned only \nwith one issue or with narrow, special interests, dominate the primaries. \nBecause the broad center of moderate and independent voters seldom vote \nin the primaries, the decisions are abdicated to small groups of \nmotivated extremists of the left or the right.<P>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<H2>Possible Reforms</H2>\nThough many believe that some type of reform is needed in the \nselection of presidential nominees, it is not known what type of reform \nwould best serve the selection process. One suggestion for reforming the \nnomination process include <B>primary clusterings</B> of one kind or another. \nOne such plan calls for grouping primaries by region, with each holding \nits primaries on a given day. This arrangement would:\n<UL>\n<LI>help to conserve a \ncandidate's energy and financial resources, since he would be able to \nfocus his attention on one area rather than hopping about the country as \nhe must do now\n<LI> given the fact that the primary season would \nopen with a group of primaries, the potential influence of any one would \nbe diluted. Consequently, we would no longer face the problem of a \ncandidate being catapulted into the lead by virtue of having won in the \nsingle state of New Hampshire<P>\n</UL>\nThe major limitation of this proposal, \nhowever, is that a candidate could be either advantaged or disadvantaged, \ndepending on which region goes first.<P>\nOthers have come out in favor of a reform that would expand public \nparticipation even beyond what exists under the current system. Known as \nthe <B>national primary</B>, it would allow the rank-and-file in each party to \nvote directly for their nominee in a single nationwide election. This \nproposal is attractive for several reasons:\n<UL>\n<LI>66% of the American people favor it\n<LI> since the \nproliferation of primaries in the last decade has brought an increase in \nthe number of people participating in the nomination process, a \nnationwide primary could reasonably be expected to swell the ranks still \nfurther\n<LI> such an arrangement would eliminate the disproportionate \nimpact of the early primaries\n<LI> although Presidential candidates \ncurrently face their first contest in February, under this proposal the \nelection would not come before May or June. This would alleviate the need \nfor candidates to begin their campaign a year or more prior to election \nyear as they do now<P>\n</UL>\nBut there are many disadvantages to this type of election process as well: \n<UL>\n<LI>Certainly for those who think the nominating process is already too \ndemanding and expensive, a national primary would merely be making a bad \nsituation worse\n<LI>since the party leaders and public \nofficials would have no formal role in the selection process, this plan \nwould deal a further blow to the already diminished position of political \nparties in the American political system\n<LI>would place well-known candidates at a distinct disadvantage. Under our current \nsystem of discrete primaries, Presidential aspirants with limited national \nvisibility have an early opportunity to demonstrate their viability as \ncandidates. \nThey would have no opportunity to do so under a national primary because it \nis a one-shot affair\n<LI>face the problem of what to do in the event that no candidate receives a \nmajority of the vote<P>\n</UL>\nThere appear to be many flaws with the way we go about choosing the \nDemocratic and Republican Party presidential nominees. As author Emmett H. Buell \nstated, the \"Decomposition of the party system in recent years has made our \nongoing quest for national leadership and accountability \nthrough our unique formula of presidential government more difficult. A \ngood first step toward arresting this ominous trend would be to repair \nthe flaws in the unfortunate nominating system that we stumbled into \nafter the disasters of 1968.\"<P>    \n<HR>\n\n<B>BIBLIOGRAPHY</B>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>Abramowitz, Alan I & Walter J.
