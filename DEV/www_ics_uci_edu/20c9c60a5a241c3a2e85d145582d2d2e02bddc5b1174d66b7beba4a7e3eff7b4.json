Kay  \u2022\nUC Irvine</FONT>\n<P><FONT SIZE=6><B>Final Exam Details</B></FONT></P>\n<P>As originally scheduled and announced on the\nsyllabus, our final exam will be in our regular classrooms on Tuesday, December 12, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. in our regular classroom, HIB 100.\n<!-- <P>Tuesday, \n  March 15, from 8:00 to 10.00 a.m.\n  December 6:\n  for the 8:00 lecture, room PSLH 100 from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m.;\n  for the 11:00 lecture, room HIB 100 from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. -->\n<P>The final will cover the whole\ncourse.\n\n<FONT>You may bring with you to the exam one page\nof notes (8 1/2 by 11 inches, both sides), on which you may place any information\nyou think will help you on the exam.  Computer-printed pages are fine.</FONT> You should bring a pen or pencil. And do bring your student photo ID. <font>You may not bring any electronic devices.</font> You do not need a bluebook or Scantron form.</P>\n<P>\n<FONT>Here are some review strategies:</FONT></P>\n<ul>\n  <li><FONT>One excellent way to review, as we&#39;ve mentioned\n    before, is to go back and retake the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/quiz/\">quizzes and midterms</A>.\n    They&#39;re all available on line.  Don't just glance over the problems and solutions and say to yourself, &quot;Yeah, that looks right.&quot; Make copies without the answers, sit down with a pencil, and actually write out your own answers to each problem. It's the active work that leads to learning.</FONT></li>\n  <li><FONT>You should also\n    go back, read, and make sure you can do all the problems from the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/hw/index.html\"> lab assignments</A>, especially any problems where you let your partner take the lead and didn't insist on understanding all the aspects of the solution. As time permits, actually code up some of the solutions to those problems.</FONT></li>\n  <li>\n    <FONT>Additional opportunities for coding practice are available at <a href=\"http://codingbat.com/python\">codingbat.com/python</a>; most of these problems are about the same size as exam questions might be.</FONT> You can also use <a href=\"http://www.pythontutor.com/\">pythontutor.com</a> to visualize exactly what's happening in memory as you execute your code.</li>\n  <li>The above review activities are all active and thus likely to be the most productive. You could also go back and re-read the Emailed course notes, the comments that sometimes appear with the answers to the quizzes, the instructors' answers to questions on Piazza, the assigned sections of the textbook, and selected UCI Replay recordings of the lectures.</li>\n</ul>\n<P>\n  <FONT>We will have a review session on Monday, December 11, from noon to 2:00. Because large rooms are hard to find and not everyone will be available at that time, <!-- it's hard to find a big room free early in exam week, -->\n  we'll hold the session virtually, on Piazza. </FONT>Anyone can look at Piazza later and see all the questions and answers.</P>\n<P><FONT><!-- If they can find us a room, we'll have it in person, but if not, we'll have it virtually on Piazza. room 1420 Donald Bren Hall. [Access to this room is a little tricky; it's from the <em>outside</em> of the building on the west side, adjacent to the University Club.] --><!--\non Monday, December\n8, from 11:30 to 1:30 in Engineering Tower 202.  \n-->\n  <!-- The &quot;price of admission&quot; to these sessions is (at least) one\n    Emailed question about the course material sent to kay@uci.edu at least an hour before the session. (Questions on paper at the session are okay, too, but getting them in advance helps me sort similar ones together.)-->\n  The review session will consist of my answering as many questions as there's time for.  The ideal strategy for you would be, before the review\n  session, to go through all the materials suggested on this page  so the session can focus on your unresolved questions.  </FONT>Log in to Piazza at the appointed time, check out what has already been asked, and ask your questions. From past experience, this works out quite well.</P>\n<!--\n <P>As on the  midterms, we expect\nto neutralize any advantage the \n10:30 people might have from talking\nto the 8:00 people by having different\nversions of the exam and by sending\nout in advance a question-by-question synopsis of the exam\nso that everybody knows in advance\njust about the same information as\nmight be transmitted in an 8:00/10:30\nconversation.  That said, it is still\nacademically dishonest for 8:00\npeople to say anything about the\nexam to 10:30 people (until the\n10:30 exam is over at 12:30;\nat that point, it's fine to discuss it).</P> \n   -->\n<P><FONT>We also recommend a good night&#39;s sleep before the exam.</FONT></P>\n<P>Good luck!\n  </OL>\n</P>\n<HR />\n<FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/\">David G.
