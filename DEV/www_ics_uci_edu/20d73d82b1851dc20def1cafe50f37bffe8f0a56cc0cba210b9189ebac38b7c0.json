It is\nlocated at the Southern tip of the Malaysian Peninsula in South-East Asia. \nDue to its strategic \n<A HREF=\"http://sunsite.nus.sg/SEAlinks/maps/singapore.gif\">location</A>,\nSingapore has benefitted greatly as an <A\nHREF=\"http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/center.html\"><H>international\nbusiness and communications center</H></A>.  It is, however, not endowed\nwith any natural resources.  As a result, the goal to make the nation a\nleader in Asia is dependent on:<br> <UL> <LI>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/business.html\"><B>Up-to-date\ntechnological advancements</A> which can further promote international\nbusiness efficiency, <LI><A HREF=\"http://www.moe.ac.sg/\">Competitive\nacademic and technological education and training</A> for the only\nresource it does have--its people</H></P> \n</UL> \n\nThis paper will attempt to examine in some detail the country's\n<OL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"#vision\">Vision to be a leader in Information \nTechnology</A>\n<LI><A HREF=\"#education\">Information Technology in Education</A>\n<LI><A HREF=\"#network\">The Interconnected Nation</A> and\n<LI><A HREF=\"#future\">Future of Information Technology</A>\n\n<HR>\n<H2> \n<A NAME=\"vision\"><B><U>A Leader in Information Technology</U></B></A></H2> \n<P></B>Today, Singapore has become a \n<A HREF=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs/user/kc3r/www/singapore.html\">thriving\ndynamic center</A> for commerce and industry -- its economy has been ranked\nthe least risky among Asian countries after Japan.  The Singapore dollar\nhas been growing strong every year, and its port is still the busiest in\nthe world.  Singapore has also been placed\namong top nations in the world in terms of strategic exploitation of\nInformation Technology by companies, computer literacy of workers and\ntelecommunications infrastructure.<br> \n<P>The government's next step is\nto make sure it stays competitive in this Information Age.  Therefore, an\nefficient, global system of communication and information transfer is\nessential for maintaining it's current position as an international\ntrading center -- businesses will definitely do better if they are linked\nto their business partners, other related businesses, the government, and\nother relevant information resources.  Advanced information technology\nwill help them to attain information which would otherwise be unaccessible\nor slower to retrieve.</P> \n<P>On August 1991, after conducting a rigorous\nstudy of the major economic sectors of Singapore, and after consulting\nwith over 200 senior executives from both the public and private \nbusiness sectors, the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ncb.gov.sg/it2k/it2k.html\"><B>IT2000\nVision</B></A> was formulated.  This vision for \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncb.gov.sg/it2k/it2kv.html\"><B>\"the Next Lap\"</B></A>\nwould bring about an advanced <A\nHREF=\"http://www.ncb.gov.sg/it2k/nii.html\"><B>\"Nationwide Information\nInfrastructure\" (NII)</B></A> which will interlink computers in every home,\noffice, school and factory.   Computers will link Singaporeans to the \nrest of the world, and will therefore \nevolve into an \"information appliance\" in the same way the telephone and\ntelevision did, enabling its users to access electronically stored\ninformation to improve business.  The NII Framework will be built using\nthe existing network structure, and a \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncb.gov.sg/it2k/niitb.html\"><B>smaller experimental\ninfrastructure</B></A> is designed to moderate and control the proceeding\nof the construction.</P>\n<P>Like the \n<A HREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/nii/NII-Table-of-Contents\"><B>U.S. \nNII</B></A>, the \n<A HREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/nii/NII-Benefits-and-Applications\"><B>\napplications</B></A> of the information infrastructure are believed to be \nable to benefit many.  \n<A HREF=\"http://query1.lycos.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/pursuit?singapore.\"><B>Both \nplans are similar</B></A> -- the U.S. NII is committed to using \nhigh-performance computing and high-speed networking to expand and speed up information \naccess and needs to be administered through \n<A HREF=\"#network\"><B>multi-agency collaboration.</B></A>  \nSingapore's IT2000 Vision similarly focuses on putting a national network \nthrough bridging, enhancing and expanding its existing \ninfrastructure.</P></H3> \n\n\n<HR><H2>\n<A NAME=\"education\"><B><U>Information Technology in \nEducation</U></B></A></H2>\n<P><A HREF=\"http://www.moe.ac.sg/\"><B>Singapore's Ministry of \nEducation</B></A> aims to nurture talent and develop individual potential \nto the fullest.  It has the important yet difficult task of making sure \nthe younger generation do not loose their cultural roots while \ntraining them to keep up with the latest innovations and technological \nadvances.  Today, Singapore has one of the most technologically advanced \neducation systems in Asia -- advanced information technology is available \nin many schools.  The\n<A HREF=\"http://nuscc.nus.sg/NUShome.html\"><B>National \nUniversity of Singapore</B></A> itself functions as a WWW server in \nSingapore.  WWW sites are found in almost all Singapore \n<A HREF=\"http://www.moe.ac.sg/schools/welcome.html\"><B>Junior \nColleges</B></A> (equivalent to highschools in the U.S.), and \n<A HREF=\"http://www.moe.ac.sg/moe/pa/forward.html\"><B>technological \neducation and training</B></A> is a high priority in the academic \nagenda.</P>\n<P>With the recent IT2000 Vision, a national project devoted to education \nin the Information Age is launched.  The \n<A HREF=\"http://www.iti.gov.sg/innovator/issue15/STW.html\"><B>Student's \nand Teacher's Workbench (STW)</B></A> is a joint project between the \nMinistry of Education (MOE) and the \n<A HREF=\"http://darwin.technet.sg/InfoWEB/economics/industry/ncb.html\"><B>National \nComputer Board (NCB)</B></A>, which \nwas largely responsible for the initiation of the IT2000 masterplan.  As \nits name suggests, the STW has 2 major components:  The Student's \nWorkbench and the Teacher's Workbench.  It provides access to Internet \nand other text, image, audio, and video lesson materials.  Retrieval, \nlayout, \ntagging, annotation as well as browsing of media items will also be \nsupported.</P>\n<P>With the use of Information Technology, students can have access to \na large variety of learning and educational materials from all over the \nworld.  They can also establish world-wide communications with people \nfrom different countries.  And most importantly, they will learn the key \nto effective utilization of information technology at a very young \nage.  In the long-run, this knowledge will benefit the country's \ngrowth and prosperity.</P>        \n\n<HR>\n<H2>\n<A NAME=\"network\"><B><U>A National Multi-Agency \nCollaboration</U></B></A></H2>\n<P>The collaboration between the major WWW servers in Singapore are both \nplanned and intended.  They include the \n<A HREF=\"http://sunsite.nus.sg/MEMEX/memex.html\"><B>Memex Research PTE \nLTD</B></A>, the\n<A HREF=\"http://darwin.technet.sg:80/technet/\"><B>Technet Unit</B></A>, \nthe \n<A HREF=\"http://sunsite.nus.sg/\"><B>SunSITE Singapre</B></A>, and the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/aboutst.html\"><B>Singapore \nTelecom</B></A>.  The Memex Research takes its name and inspiration from \nVannevar Bush, a pioneer in computer design.  Bush coined the term \n\"Memex\" in an article\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/VBush.html.Z\"><B><U>As We May \nThink</U></B></A>.  There, the term is defined as \"a future device for \nindividual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library.\"  \nMemex's mission is to deliver enterprise-wide solution for managing \nresources effectively and to prepare for emerging technology.  The \nTechnet is a global communication technology with full Internet access.  \nIt is also the premier organization in Singapore in charge of the \npromotion of the Internet's widespread usage.  The SunSITE Singapore \noperates out of the National University of Singapore's Computer Center.  \nIt is a SPARCserver 1000 with 4 CPUs and 6GB of disk space.  Finally, the \nSingapore Telecom is licensed by the Telecommunication Authority of \nSingapore to provide telecommunication services.</P>  \n<P>Memex, Technet, and SunSITE  work closely together to provide services to \nall public and private sectors of the country.  For example, the Memex \nservice is maintained through a collaborative project between the Memex \nResearch Pte Ltd and the Technet Unit and is hosted at SunSITE.  The Technet \nUnit is also managed and operated by the Computer Center at the National \nUniversity of Singapore.  Singapore Telecom is somewhat different from \nthe other 3 WWW servers because it is not a research or education \ninstitution.  It's \noriginal and primary purpose is to provide telephone services to the \npublic.  However, as the Internet becomes more and more popular, \nTelecom started a new subsidiary division, the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.singnet.com.sg/info.html\"><B>SingNet</B></A>, which is \na 24-hour service that gives users access to database linked to the \nInternet.  It provides customer and product support to businesses \nover the Internet network and allows home users to e-mail\nworld-wide. \n\n<HR>\n<H2>\n<A NAME=\"future\"><B><U>The Future of Information Technology in \nSingapore</U></B></A></H2>\nSingapore Telecom has been in the forefront of promoting and establishing \nthe usage of telecommunications technology through a number of projects.  \nOn December 27, 1994, it announced it will lower rates for its \n<A HREF=\"http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/ilc.html\"><B>international \nleased circuits</B></A> by up to 25% starting January 1, 1995. On January 24, the company \nannounced its plan to invest US$94 million in an ambitious United Kingdom \nproject called \n<A \nHREF=\"http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/inmarsat.html\"><B>I-CO</B></A>, \nwhich will provide a seamless, global mobile service to its customers via a network of 12 satellites, \nproviding different telecommunication services.  Then on January 25, 1995, \nthe company and three other major telecommunications carriers in South-East Asia announced their \n<A HREF=\"http://www.singnet.com.sg/singnet/singtel/asean.html\"><B>plan</B></A> to \ncoordinate the telecommunications needs of businesses in the region.  \n\"Telecommunications infrastructure plays a vital role in the region's \neconomic development...our initial services will include intra-regional \nVSAT and private leased services and facilities management.\"  said the \ncompany spokesman.</P>  \n<P>With this expansion of the nation's telecommunication \nservice to the rest of the world and the company's belief in the \nimportance of Information Technology, it is very likely Singapore will \ncontinue to preserve its position as a leader in international business \nand trade.  Telecom's vision to be a global company and investor will \nprovide the infrastructure needed for it to become an efficient global \ninformation center in the future.</P>  \n<P>At home, a challenge was given to more than 135 principals, teachers \nand MOE headquarter officers at a talk on \n<A HREF=\"http://www.moe.ac.sg/moe/pa/contact/vol02/c9cug.html\"></B>Using \nInternet</B></A> on November 5th, 1994.  Fascinating information about the history of the Internet, popular \nservices available via the Internet, and application of Internet in \neducation was given, and every principal, teacher and officer was \nencouraged to incorporate the use of Internet into the school curriculum.\nThe promotion of Information Technology in education is aimed not only to \nimprove the quality of education itself, but also to educate and familiarize \nthe younger generation with advanced Information Technology.  SunSITE, \nTechnet and Memex, with its strong focus on research and education, will be \nable to support the nation's goal in education.   Also, since the \nmajor Internet service is hosted by SunSITE at the University of \nSingapore, the plan to push the technology in and through education has \nalready begun.  Such an ideal collaboration\nbetween the major players of Information Technology, along with the \nunceasing support of the government, is sure to produce positive \nresults.  </P>\n<P>To some, this collaboration between the government and \ngovernment-affiliated agencies strongly suggests a \"monopoly\" of the \nInformation Technology service because it gives them too much control over \nthe entire service offering.  It is therefore important that laws regulating \nthe use and access of electronic information by home users, businesses \nAND the government are well thought-out and planned to prevend the abuse \nof such an efficient and powerful technology.</P>  \n\n<HR>\n<B><U>Five Major Reference Sites:</U></B>\n<P><OL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://sunsite.nus.sg/\">http://sunsite.nus.sg/</A><BR>\nThe home page of the National University of Singapore.
