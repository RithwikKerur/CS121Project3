In this paper, instead of investigating\nhow to produce \"good\" drawings, we tackle the opposite\nproblem of producing \"bad\" drawings. In particular, we study\nhow to construct orthogonal drawings with many bends along the edges\nand with large area. Our results show surprising contact points, in\nGraph Drawing, between the computational cost of niceness and the one\nof ugliness.\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
