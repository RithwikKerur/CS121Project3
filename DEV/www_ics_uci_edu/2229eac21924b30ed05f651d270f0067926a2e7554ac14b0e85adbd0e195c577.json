Otherwise, choose an edge <I>e</I> connecting two\ndifferent faces of G, and remove it; <I>e</I> can then only appear once in the\nboundary of each face, so the graph remains connected -- any path\ninvolving <I>e</I> can be replaced by a path around the other side of one of\nthe two faces.  This removal decreases both the number of faces and\nedges by one, and the result then holds by induction.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nThis proof commonly appears in graph theory textbooks\n(for instance <a href=\"refs.html#BonMur\">Bondy and Murty</a>)\nbut is my least favorite: it is to my mind unnecessarily complicated\nand inelegant; the full justification for some of the steps seems to be\njust as much work as all of the first proof.\nIt doesn't generalize very well,\nand there are some critical details that textbook authors often omit.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
