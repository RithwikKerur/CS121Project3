PGraphite is a\nworking prototype through which we are exploring the requirements for the\npersistent object capability of an object management system in the Arcadia\nsoftware environment. PGraphite represents both a set of abstractions that\n a model for dealing with persistent objects in an environment and a\nset of implementation strategies for realizing that model. PGraphite currently\nprovides a type definition mechanism for one important class of types, namely\ndirected graphs, and the automatic generation of Ada implementations for the\ndefined types, including their persistence capabilities.  We present\nPGraphite, describe and motivate its model of persistence, outline the\nimplementation strategies that it embodies, and discuss some of our experience\nwith the current version of the system.\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:33:03 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
