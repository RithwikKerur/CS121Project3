I recommend, without passion,\n       <em> Core Java </em> by Horstmann and Cornell (latest edition).\n   <li> AI Text: Any one you like. I recommend, with passion,\n   <em> Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach </em> by Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell. \n      <li> Computer Language: Java with JDK1.1 or JDK1.2.\n   <li> Computer Environment: Symantec Cafe on PC under Windows NT.\n   <li> Course Prerequisite: ICS171\n   <li>Knowledge Prerequisites\n       <ul>\n       <li>  Java Applications\n      <li>   Mathematics: Vector Algebra, Boolean Algerbra\n      <li>   Computer Science: Standard data structures, search methods, etc\n      </ul>\n   <li> Bboard:  Read ics.172 for latest class announcements.\n</ul>\n<h4> Course Goal </h4>\n      Enable students to write Applets that reveal the structure\nand performance of several AI methods, including those dealing with\nsearch, problem solving, learning, and decision making. These areas\nhave had significant contributions to either scientific or industrial\napplications.  Object-oriented design will be stressed. There will\nbe five modules. Each module will have two lectures on AI theory\nand one lecture on design. Another lecture is reserved for whatever\nis most needed, including Java, design, implementation, or AI theory.\n\nFor each module, you will do both a design and an implementation.\nThe design consists of your guesses to the objects and their methods\nand fields. The design has no code associated with it. The design\nis due on the first class of the week after the assigmnent. No credit\nwill be given for late designs. Designs will be graded on the basis\non their rationality. It is not expected that they will be completey\ncorrect. Nor do they need be followed.\n\nYour implementation should be readily runnable over the net. Consequently\nno credit will be given for late implementations. Your implementation\nis due on the first class of the second week after the assigment.\nImplementations will be graded on the correctness, style and\nefficiency. Efficiency is not a  major goal, but if some computation\nis done particularly poorly, such as an O(n^3) sort, credit will be taken off.\n\n\n\n<h3> AI Modules </h3>\n<ol> \n\n   <li> Linear Threshold Learning: Perceptron and Winnow.\n   <li> Traveling Salesman Problem: Heuristic search, A*, and branch-and-bound.\n   <li> Clustering: kmeans, expectation maximization (EM)\n   <li> Game-playing: Perfect and non-perfect information games. Alpha-beta\n   search. Sampling.\n   <li> Decision-Tree Learning: automatic creation of expert systems.\n\n</ol>\n<h3> Work Load </h3>\n  Each module will take  several hundred lines of Java code. Weekly\nassignments alternate between design and implementation.\n\n<h3> Grading </h3> \nAssignments will alternate between design and\nimplementation. The design consists of the objects, method prototypes\nand data-members. It is not anticipated that designs will be followed\nexactly, but they should be reasonable. Similarly code does not have\nto optimal, but again must be reasonable clear, correct, and\nefficient. For each module, design and implementation with be worth\n15% of your grade.\n\nAssignments  receive no credit if handed in late.\n<p>\n Any code copying will result in letter in your file besides receiving\nno credit for the assignment.\n<p>\n There will be a final exam which must be passed to pass the class.\nWhen averaged with the other scores, the final will count for 25%\nof your grade. The final will be based on an understand of \nthe AI concepts that are covered in the lectures.\n \n\n\n<h3> Notes </h3>\n\nLecture notes for  the Java Language are available on-line\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kibler/javacourse/java.html\"> Java Notes </a>.\n Please tell me if you find any errors or misrepresentations.\n<br>\nBy the end of the course students are expected to competent in:\n <ul> \n   <li> writing applications and applets in Java.\n   <li> doing an object-oriented design.\n   <li> judging whether an ai method is appropriate.\n   <li> coding  several standard ai methods.\n   <li> evaluating the performance of an ai methods.\n </ul> \n\n</body>\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
