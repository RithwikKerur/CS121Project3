When the Bron&ndash;Kerbosch algorithm (with pivoting) is run on a 4-vertex complete graph, how many recursive calls does it make in total? When the algorithm without pivoting is run on a 4-vertex complete graph, how many recursive calls does it make in total?</p>\n<p>(265 students:) Give formulas for the number of recursive calls made by the Bron&ndash;Kerbosch algorithm on an $n$-vertex complete graph, with and without pivoting, as a function of $n$. (Suggestion: try it on small graphs first to find the pattern, and then verify that the pattern you find is correct.)</p></li>\n</ol>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
