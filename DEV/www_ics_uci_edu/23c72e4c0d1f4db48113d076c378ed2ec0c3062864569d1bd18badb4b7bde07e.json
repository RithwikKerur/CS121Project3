These will consist of\nrelatively short problems that will give each of you the opportunity to\nbuild your own skills, mostly in Python programming but also in other course\ntopics.  You will show your completed work to the TA, ideally during lab on Monday (but note the preliminary checking step described below).  The TA will check off that you&#39;ve completed the assignment,\nbut the main point is that you become comfortable with the topics it covers\nand ask </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">about anything you&#39;re not comfortable with (in class, in lab, by Email to </FONT><font face=\"Courier New\" size=2><a href=\"mailto:i42@uci.edu\">i42@uci.edu</a></font><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">).  It is completely fine for\nyou to discuss these exercises with your classmates, but it is absolutely\nforbidden for you to copy down (on paper or electronically) another student&#39;s\nsolution and submit it as your own.  The whole reason for these exercises\nis for you to develop your own skill.  If you don&#39;t, you won&#39;t be\nable to contribute to the lab assignments or succeed on the quizzes or exams.</font></P>\n<P><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">There's one additional step before you can get your work checked off by the TA: First, you need to get it checked off by a classmate. In general, you should check the homework of your current lab partner, and he or she should check yours. If your answers and your checker's don't agree, you need to figure out why and resolve the discrepancy (by yourselves if possible, or with the TA's help); the resolution may be that both answers are acceptable, of course. This isn't exactly &quot;pair homework,&quot; since you won't produce the work jointly, but it will give you both a point of common experience as you start your lab work. If the TA finds that significant errors remain in your work that aren't noted and acknowledged by the checker, the checker's name will be mud (that is, the checker will receive some unspecified kind of black mark, so it pays to take the checking seriously). </font></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Lab assignments will be larger programming\nprojects.  We will have about six of them during the quarter.  You\nwill do them in pairs, following the usual <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/pair.html\">pair programming instructions</a>. You may not have the same partner twice, but each student may choose one assignment (after the first) to do alone as a &quot;pair programming holiday.&quot;  Be sure to check out the <A HREF=\"assignments_index_files/grading_criteria_for_lab.html\">grading criteria</A>\nfor lab assignments. As always, it's best to choose a partner whose Python experience is at about the same level as your own.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">We encourage students to talk with each other\nand help each other understand how to do the assignments, even beyond your\npair-programming partners.  Especially for language details, posting questions at piazza.com may be helpful. There are some limits, though.  Everyone should\nre-read the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/honesty.html\">guidelines for collaboration and independent work</A>.</FONT></P>\n<!--\n<P><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">We have listed all the assignments for the quarter here, but we might adjust them as the quarter goes on. If you're working on an assignment early&mdash;before the previous one's due date&mdash;be sure to check back.</font></P>\n-->\n\n<HR>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/\">David G.
