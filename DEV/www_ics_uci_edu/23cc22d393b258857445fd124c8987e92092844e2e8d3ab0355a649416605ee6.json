For\n<i>m</i> = 2 an algorithm achieving a competitive ratio of 4/3 has\nbeen found by Bartal, Fiat, Karloff and Vohra. These same authors\nshow a matching lower bound. Chen, van Vliet and Woeginger, and\nindependently Sgall, have shown a lower bound which converges to\n<i>e</i>/(<i>e</i>-1) as <i>m</i> goes to infinity. Prior to this\nwork, no randomized algorithm for <i>m</i> &gt; 2 was known. An\nalgorithm for <i>m</i> = 3 is presented, and it is shown that this\nalgorithm is 3/2-competitive.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
