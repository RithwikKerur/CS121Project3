And in this instance, you who\nare the father of <B>X</B>, from a paternal love of your own\nchildren have been led to attribute to <B>X</B> a quality which <B>X</B>\ncannot have; for this discovery of yours will create\nforgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use\ntheir memories; they will trust to the external <B>X</B>\nand not remember of themselves.\n\n<P>\nThe specific which you\nhave discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and\nyou give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of\ntruth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned\nnothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally\nknow nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of\nwisdom without the reality.\n</blockquote>\n\nQuestion: What is <B>X</B>?\n<BR>\nAnswer: <em>&quot;<A HREF=\"./tech.crit.clsc.html\">Click here</A>&quot;</em>\n\n<P>\n<HR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin\"><address>franklin@uci.edu</address></A>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
