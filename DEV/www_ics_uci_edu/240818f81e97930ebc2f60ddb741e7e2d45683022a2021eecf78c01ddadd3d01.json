In\nthis paper we give a new greedy 3-approximation algorithm for\nmaximum leaf spanning trees. The running time O((m+n)alpha(m,n))\nrequired by our algorithm, where m is the number of edges and n is\nthe number of nodes, is almost linear in the size of the graph. We\nalso demonstrate thatour analysis of the performance of the greedy\nalgorithm is tight via an example. \n\n<p></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
