Explain why or why not.\n(Hint: Try it with a few small numbers to see what happens.)</P>\n\n<PRE>\n    Read a number x.\n    Initialize a counter to zero.\n\n    While x is greater than zero, perform the following steps:\n\n        Increase the counter by one.\n        If x is odd, replace x by (x+1)/2;\n        otherwise (if x is even) replace x by x-2.\n\n    Once the loop terminates (if it does),\n    output the value of the counter and halt.\n</PRE>\n\n<P><LI>In the imaginary country of Binaria, the currency is based on the \ncentina, which is worth approximately the same as a penny.  The coins of \nBinaria have values that are powers of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 \ncentinas.</P>\n\n<P>(a) What coins should you use to make change for the following amounts of \nmoney?  (In each case answer with the smallest possible set of coins that \nadds up to the correct value.)</P>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>15 centinas\n<LI>29 centinas\n<LI>39 centinas\n<LI>108 centinas\n</OL>\n\n<P>(b) Why might it be useful for Binarian cash registers to display \namounts of money using binary notation?\n</OL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
