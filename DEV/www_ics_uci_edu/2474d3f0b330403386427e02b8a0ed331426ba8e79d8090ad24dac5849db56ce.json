This\nis a hot topic in algorithms research combining ideas from AI\n(constraint programming and large-scale search for solutions of\nNP-hard problems) with theoretical computer science (worst case\nanalysis and algorithmic improvement). There is also plenty of room\nfor new research due to the large gap between experimentally\nmeasured performance and known worst case bounds.</p>\n\n<p>There is no assigned text, due to the novelty of the subject area;\ninstead I'll build up a set of papers to read over the course of\nthe quarter. The format will be lecture and discussion, with a\nsmall amount of homework to help encourage everyone to keep up. All\nICS grad students are welcome but I recommend a strong\nunderstanding of analysis of algorithms, at least at the ICS 161\nlevel.</p>\n\n<h2 align=center><a href=\"sched.html\">Schedule and Homeworks</a></h2>\n\n<h2 align=center><a href=\"refs.html\">References and Readings</a></h2>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
