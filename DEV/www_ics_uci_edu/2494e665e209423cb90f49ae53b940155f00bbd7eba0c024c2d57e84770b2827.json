You would say a small country, \nexpensive to live, a great economic power, etc. The last characteristics \nof <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/\">Japan</A> is deeply related to \nJapanese education. The academic \nachievement of Japanese students is pretty high. For example, in 1986 94 \n% of students who graduated from lower-secondary school entered \nupper-secondary school. That is pretty similar to that of <A \nHREF=\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/usa.html\">the United \nStates</A>. 35 % of them continued on to University, which is lower than \nthat of <A\nHREF=\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/usa.html\">the United\nStates</A> but higher than \nthat of west <A HREF=\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/europe.html\">European \ncountries</A>(<A \nHREF=\"#b1\">bib.1</A>). This \nhigh ratio of Japanese education has helped  <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/\">Japan</A> develop so much, but at \nthe same time she has many problems concerning <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">education</A>. \n<p>\n<LI><h2><B>General Information</B></h2>\n<p>\nEducational system in <A\nHREF=\"http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/\">Japan</A> is basically 6-3-3-4; 6 \nyears of elementary \nschool, 3 years of each lower and upper secondary schools, and usually 4 \nyears of college. Some people go to 2 year junior college where 90% of \nstudents are women. And there are many other institutions. Special \ntraining schools which offer students special skills, such as \"<A \nHREF=\"http://unhinfo.unh.edu/1m/unh/acad/cats/grad/grad.cs\">computer \nscience</A>\" and \"vocational training\", and Miscellaneous schools where they \ncan learn various kinds of subjects(<A \nHREF=\"#b2\">bib.2</A>).\n<p>\n<A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">Education</A> in \n<A\nHREF=\"http://www.ntt.jp:80/japan/map/\">Japan</A> is free and compulsory \nfrom the 1st grade through the \n9th grade. Schools go by trimester system, and students are supposed to \nattend school for at least 210 days. School year usually begins in April \nand ends in March. They have to go to school Monday through Friday, and \none-half day on Saturdays. Right now they are considering if they take a \nday off on Saturday or not in public shcool(<A HREF=\"#b1\">bib.1</A>,<A \nHREF=\"#b2\">bib.2</A>). \n<p>\nPrivate schools started playing an important role in education especially \nin upper-secondary schools. Most of the elementary schools are virtually \npublic school. Private elementary schools are less than 1%. However, when \nit comes to lower and upper secondary schools, the ratio goes up to 5% \nfor lower-secondary school and 24% for all upper-secondary schools. There \nis a tendency that private schools take care of students in terms of \nstudying a lot more than public schools(<A\nHREF=\"#b2\">bib.2</A>).\n<p>\n<LI><h2><B>Problems of Japanese <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">Education</A> \nSystem--<A HREF=\"http://txfs1.hfb.se/general.html\">college entrance \nexaminations</A></h2></B> \n<p>\n<B>3.1.Memorization</B>\n<p>\nFirst of all, one of the biggest issues of Japanese <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">education</A> is \n<A HREF=\"http://txfs1.hfb.se/general.html\">college entrance\nexams</A>. That drives everybody crazy especially last year in \nupper-secondary school. Because of that they have to spend much time on \nstudying useless things. A key word for studying is \"memorization\" which \nwon't stay on their mind for a long, and which doesn't help them acquire \nanything important. In the case of history ,for instance, they have to \nmemorize all the year when something important happened. that is it. They \ndon't go into depth for that. They just cover the surface of \nhistory(<A HREF=\"#b2\">bib.2</A>). \n<p>\n<B>3.2.Limited Subjects</B>\n<p>\nSince subjects which are tested in the exams are decided in advance, most \nof the students only study those subjects instead of their intersets. \nThere is definitely lack of choices and little effort is made for that. \nThat is seriously killing various personalities for each person(<A \nHREF=\"#b1\">bib.1</A>, <A HREF=\"#b2\">bib.2</A>). \n<p>\n<B>3.3.Poor <A HREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A></B>\n<p>\nAlthough Japanese students spend a lot of time on studying <A \nHREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A>, most \nof them can't use it practically. In lower and upper secondary school \nthey focus on mostly grammar and readings which occupy most of the part \non <A HREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A> exams. They study \n<A HREF=\"#http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A> only for that. \nThat is why there are \nso many Japanese who can't communicate in <A \nHREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A>. Besides, there are \nfew teachers who can speak <A \nHREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A> \nwell at school, and basically \nthey are lacking in native <A \nHREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A> \nspeakers(<A HREF=\"#b2\">bib.2</A>, <A HREF=\"#b3\">bib.3</A>). \n<p>\n<B>3.4.Cram School=\"Yobiko\"</B>\n<p>\nThis kind of college entrance examinations increase the number of \nstudents who go to cram schools called \"Yobiko\" which help students \nprepare for entrance exams. So basically many students go to both regular \nschool and Yobiko just to get in a college. Actually Yobico is more \nfamous for those who didn't enter any college previous year. They are \ncalled \"Ronin\", and to be a Ronin at least for a year is very common \nespecially among men. Ronin occupy about 40% of college entrance, which \nis very large amount. That shows how competitive the college entrance is. \nThere are some who spend more than 5 years as Ronin, which seems like \nreal waste of time. Those kind of people are dying for one vary famous \nuniversity, most of the case, <A \nHREF=\"http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/\">University of Tokyo</A>(<A \nHREF=\"#b2\">bib.2</A>). <p> <B>3.5.Connection to job</B>\n<p>\nThe reason why so many people care about particular Universities is \nbecause it has much to do with tehir future jobs. There is a very close linkage \nbetween University background and employment. If they want to work for \nbig 1st-rank company, the most important things for them is not what \nthey studied in college but the fact that they graduated from certain \nprestigious University. Especially private sector doesn't expect \nUniversity graduates to learn something special at college. They would \nrather train them by their own way, and make them fit in their own \nsector(<A HREF=\"#b1\">bib.1</A>). \n<p>\n<B>3.6.Big Influence from Future Job</B>\n<p>\nFor the final purpose to get a good job, competition of <A \nHREF=\"http://txfs1.hfb.se/general.html\">college entrance\nexams</A> \nbecame keen and harsh. That aslo affects <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">education</A> \nsystem in both \nlower and upper secondary schools. Nowadays even elementary schools have \nbeen influenced by that, and they are forced to study for getting in good \nschool which has good education system for entering 1st-rank \ncolleges(<A HREF=\"#b2\">bib.2</A>). \n<p>\n<B>3.7.Japanese Students from Overseas and Foreign Students</B>\n<p>\nIn this stressful situation, another problem is coming up. That is the \ncase for those who spent many years outside of Japan. When they come back \nto Japan, they will have some problems to fit in school especially in \nlower and upper secondary school. Unless they go to oversea Japanese \nschool, they will be far behind in the class, and it is so hard for them \nto get in college through regular examinations. Since they are lacking in\nEnglish-speak teachers, and many of the students are studying for \nentering good schools, it would be difficult for them to follow the \nschool system in Japan. Thus, many of them tend to go to either American \nschool or International school(<A HREF=\"#b5\">bib.5</A>). \n<p>\n<LI><h2><B>Conclusion</B></h2>\n<p>\nIn order to solve those problems, some reforms have been conducted. \nThrough those reforms the National Council on <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">Education</A> Reform introduce \nsome new proposals. First of all, internationalization is an issue for \nevery <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">education</A> \nlevel, especially for higher <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">education</A>. \nLife \nlong <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">education</A> \nwhich allows adult people to have <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/homes/mcbryan/public_html/bb/38/summary.html\">education</A> is \nalso a principal proposal, such as expansion of University entrance \nopportunities. There is a need for improvement of teaching foreign \nlanguages, particularly <A \nHREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A>. \nThe government invited many \nnative <A HREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A> speakers to \nimprove spoken <A HREF=\"http://www.arts.cuhk.hk/Lit.html\">English</A> for \nJapanese. The most controversial issue here is the harsh <A \nHREF=\"http://txfs1.hfb.se/general.html\">college entrance  \nexaminations</A>. The \nministry urged Universities to have more substitute for the exams, such \nas admission by recomendation, admission by special skills, admission for \nthose who returned from overseas and who want to keep studying years \nafter they graduated. If the system of the exams changes, there will be \nmore selection of subjects which they can study instead of \nmemorization, and acceptance for foreign students will become easier, too. \nEven though there is little evidence for that so far, hopefully those \nchanges have been happening step by step(<A HREF=\"#b1\">bib1</A>, <A \nHREF=\"#b2\">bib2</A>, <A HREF=\"#b4\">bib4</A>, <A HREF=\"#b5\">bib5</A>). \n</OL>\n<HR>\n<h2><B>Bibliography</B></h2>\n<p>\n<UL>\n<LI><A NAME=\"b1\">(bib.1)</A>\n<A \nHREF=\"gopher://gan1.ncc.go.jp/11/JAPAN/Society/Education\">gopher://ganl.ncc.gp.jp/11/JAPAN/Society/Education</A>\n<LI><A NAME=\"b2\">(bib.2)</A>\n<A \nHREF=\"gopher://umslvma.umsl.edu/00/LIBRARY/GOVDOCS/ARMYAHBS/ARMANTOC/AAHB0023\">bib.2=gopher://umslvma.umsl.edu/00/LIBRARY/GOVDOCS/ARMYAHBS/ARMANTOC/AAHB0023</A>\n<LI><A NAME=\"b3\">(bib.3)</A>\n<A \nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.stolaf.edu/0R0-12001-/Internet%20Resources/St.%20Olaf%20Sponsored%20Mailing%20Lists/Omni-Cultural-Academic-Resource/Society-Culture-Religion/Cultures/Japan/English-Class\">bib.3=gopher://gopher.stolaf.edu/0R0-12001-/Internet%20Resources/St.%20Olaf%20Sponsored%20Mailing%20Lists/Omni-Cultural-Academic-Resource/Society-Culture-Religion/Cultures/Japan/English-Class</A>\n<LI><A NAME=\"b4\">(bib.4)</A>\n<A \nHREF=\"http://jw.nttam.com/LWT/GENERAL/LIFE/lwt_life_education.html\">bib.4=http://jw.nttam.com/LWT/GENERAL/LIFE/1wt_life_education.html</A>\n<LI><A NAME=\"b5\">(bib.5)</A>\n<A\nHREF=\"http://www.ntt.jp/japan/living/lm6.html\">bib.5=http://www.ntt.jp/japan/living/lm6.html</A>\n</UL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
