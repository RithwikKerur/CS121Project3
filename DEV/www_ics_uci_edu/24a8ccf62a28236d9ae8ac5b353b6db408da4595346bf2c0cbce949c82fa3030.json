Our research develops\ndefenses for IoT systems against existing and future attack types. We\ninvestigate both host-based and network-based solutions, using\nsoftware and hardware implementations. We are also developing a cyber\ntest range which is used to evaluate the performance of a system under\na realistic attack.

Scams typically result in financial\nloss by convincing a victim to perform an ill-advised action such as\nsending money, or convincing him to provide private information. There\nhas been a great deal of research studying phishing emails, but\nphone-based social engineering attacks are not well understood. Our\nresearch in phone-based social engineering attacks is two-fold, 1)\nevaluating the effectiveness of different types of attacks, and 2)\ndeveloping a tool to automatically detect attacks. We are performing a\nstudy in which we attempt different phone scams against participants\nto see what they are vulnerable to. We are also developing a scam\ndetection approach which uses Natural Language Understanding\ntechniques to identify suspicious intent in a conversation. This work\nis supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant\nNo. 1813858.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe have distributed an open source tool implementing our first\napproach to this\nproblem, <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/security-defenders/social-engineering-defense\"> Social Engineering Defense</a>.

The programming task is heavily manual since the job of\ninterpreting natural language specifications is typically left to\nhumans. Our research seeks to simplify programming tasks by\nautomatically interpreting natural language specifications and\ngenerating code artifacts with matching functionality. For instance, a\nspecification may describe a pre-condition property of a function we\ncould automatically generate an assertion statement to check the\nproperty.The ultimate goal of the work is to automate the generation\nof segments of code in order to allow the programmer to focus on more\nabstract design issues.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n</div> <!-- close main div -->\n\n</div> <!--  close bgwrapper -->\n\n<hr class=\"bottombar\" />\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
