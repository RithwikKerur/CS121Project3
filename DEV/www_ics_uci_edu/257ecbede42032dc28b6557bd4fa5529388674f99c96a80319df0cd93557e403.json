We discuss\nthe expected length of the longest common subsequence when A and B\nare random binary strings of length n. It has long been known that\nfor large n this is asymptotic to g n, where g is some constant. We\ndiscuss techniques for obtaining upper and lower bounds on the\nvalue of g.</h2>\n\n<p></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
