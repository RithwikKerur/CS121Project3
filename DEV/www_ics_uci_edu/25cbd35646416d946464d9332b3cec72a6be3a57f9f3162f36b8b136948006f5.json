Over the years, I have created or overseen the creation of several interesting\n        prototype systems, that employed next-generation enablers and related applications for\n        showcasing the technology. Many of these systems where designed for multimedia applications.\n        My contributions can be classified into four broad categories -\n        (i) Mobile Applications\n        (ii) Middleware Enablers\n        (iii) Peer-to-Peer Systems and\n        (iv) Power Management.\n    </p>\n\n    <p>\n        I believe that systems research should involve both theoretical and applied\n        solutions, which together have the greatest potential for impacting a research area.\n        Research prototypes need to be designed with the goal of addressing a real-life\n        problem and evaluating a novel and interesting approach to an important underlying\n        research problem. While simulations can be effective in verifying and evaluating theoretical\n        foundations, it is also important to have a compelling prototype for real-world usability.\n        Such an approach is very effective not only in validating the prototype, but also in\n        gathering qualitative feedback and more credible quantitative results. I also believe that\n        the best research results are achieved through effective collaboration where-in the\n        perspectives and expertise of each collaborator could contribute towards new ideas and\n        better systems.

The goal was to create a tablet application that could be\n                    used to compliment content playing live on TV. The applications were designed to\n                    access content aggregated from the TMS metadata server and present users with options\n                    to pivot around key content types. I created the first HTML5 prototype of the\n                    application which was hosted on the Amazon servers. The application was successfully\n                    demonstrated at CES 2011. Subsequently, our team built upon this application to create\n                    a native Android application (for Xoom tablets) with a redesigned user interface while\n                    adding social components such as presence, chat and recommendations. The native android\n                    application is still used in several company wide internal demos showcasing the\n                    technology built within the labs.\n                </p>\n\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n    </p>\n\n\n    <!-- Mover -->\n    <br/><br/>\n\n    <p>\n    <table class=\"listing\">\n        <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <p class=\"projectName\">Motorola Mover </p>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;(shipping product)</span></tr>\n\n        <tr>\n            <td align=\"center\" width=\"200\">\n                <img width=\"120\" src=\"./images/moverUI.jpg\" alt=\"Mover\"/>\n            </td>\n            <td>\n                <p>\n\n                    In 2009, I worked with the Motorola Home business unit for the initial design\n                    of the Motorola Mover product prototype. The idea was to transcode and encrypt recorded\n                    content on a user's set-top box and store it on the Motorola mover. This content would\n                    subsequently be exposed via a RESTful web interface to authorized mobile phones (belonging to the\n                    same\n                    user). I defined the web interfaces and created the initial working prototype\n                    iPhone application for the project.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n\n                    I also created the initial prototype iPhone application used by the <i>Motorola WaveRunner</i>\n                    product. The Waverunner product was designed for AT&T U-verse customers and presented\n                    the ability to schedule PVR from the U-verse set-top box, PC and the iPhone. The\n                    content would then be recorded on the network and would be available for download and\n                    playback on the iPhone (and subsequently other mobile phones).

Through this, the individual \u2018smart\u2019 devices in a home (TVs, cell phones,\n                    media players, tablets, PCs, home automation, etc) are the pool of configurable\n                    computing resources that can be joined together as needed to form a single system (a\n                    device ensemble) and then dynamically reconfigured as needed as people and devices come\n                    and go or move within the home. The \u2018Home Space\u2019 becomes the nexus for content,\n                    applications, control, and context.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    We spent much of 2012, conceptualizing, architecting, designing and prototyping the first\n                    version of the framework.

It is intended to be deployed in ad-hoc wireless local area\n                    network environments. CPMP provides a framework for periodically communicating\n                    information about what content is currently being consumed and what content is being\n                    sought for future consumption at each participating node. Our goal was to make the\n                    protocol efficient and scalable while including features intended to support\n                    synchronization of presence message transmissions. CPMP messages are transmitted\n                    periodically (via multicast UDP/IP frames) to inform nearby devices of updated\n                    content\n                    presence information using IP\n                    multicast.</p>\n\n                <p>Each CPMP message includes a field that specifies the number of seconds in which to\n                    expect a new CPMP message. By transmitting\n                    CPMP messages at approximately the same time CPMP messages are expected, an\n                    implementation can avoid powering on the wireless LAN radio for transmissions -\n                    essentially piggy-backing CPMP transmission with reception. Ideally, all\n                    participating\n                    nodes will use this technique simultaneously, resulting in synchronization of CPMP\n                    activity.

This would have reduced the load on broadband access links and VoD servers\n                    by reducing upstream traffic to the video head end.

I proposed a cross-layer approach to\n                    energy optimization, where a distributed middleware component is used to coordinate energy\n                    optimization at various system layers. My contention was that a distributed middleware with\n                    knowledge of application QoS requirements, network transmission characteristics and energy budget\n                    could dynamically negotiate QoS with applications as well as coordinate adaptations at various\n                    system layers such that the application QoS requirements could me met under the energy constraints.\n                    To facilitate such cross-layer adaptations, I designed and evaluated a system called \u201cDynamo\u201d that\n                    implemented APIs for bidirectional information sharing across various system layers. Using this\n                    system I have demonstrated that energy savings as high as 55% were possible through joint adaptation\n                    of the various system components (CPU, wireless network interface and LCD backlight). In addition to\n                    the Dynamo system, I developed a graph theoretic solution to achieve energy aware task\n                    reconfigurations for optimizing energy consumption on mobile devices. I also developed a game\n                    theoretic approach for analyzing and optimizing energy consumption on mobile systems.\n                </p>\n\n                <p>\n                    For more information (papers, downloads, presentations) please visit the\n                    <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dsm/dyn/release/\">Dynamo</a> website.
