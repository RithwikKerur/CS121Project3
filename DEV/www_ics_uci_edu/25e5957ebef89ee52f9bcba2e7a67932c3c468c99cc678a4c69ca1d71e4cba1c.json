He\r\n  passed away on April 26, 2000,(seventh day of Passover) in Brooklyn\r\n  NY. His parents were Reb Chaim Shimon and Gittel. Reb Chaim\r\n  Shimon was a Chazzan and an expert mohel, and was respected and\r\n  revered by all and was very liked by the Bobover Rebbe Zt\"l. As a child\r\n  young Aaron was taken to see the holy Bobover Rebbe Zt\"l, Rabbi\r\n  Benzion Halberstam, and was a devoted Bobover Chasid since then. As\r\n  a bachur he was given the honor to sing Hamavdil by the Bobover\r\n  Rebbe Zt\"l accompanied by a choir of talented singers which he had\r\n  brought along to Bobov. (Among them were Reb Shaul Huterer, Reb\r\n  Moshe Wachsman, and Reb Herschel Tauber Zt\"l.)\r\n   \r\n  Reb Aaron was blessed with a unique melodious voice and distinct style\r\n  of composing songs. When singing one of his songs Reb Aaron sang\r\n  with all his body and soul. Everybody around him would become\r\n  enveloped in his magical world of music. From the lively songs which\r\n  Reb Aaron composed that would liven up the most downtrodden or the\r\n  very heartfelt songs that were composed and sung from deep within Reb\r\n  Aaron's heart, would soften even the hardest hearts. At every family\r\n  simcha or joyous occasion Reb Aaron would delight all attendees with\r\n  his lively songs. Over the years he composed more than one hundred\r\n  compositions.\r\n   \r\n  His life was dedicated though to something else, he was a Mohel. When\r\n  he reached 15 years of age his father (who was a Mohel) took him along\r\n  to every Bris that he did, thereby training him in. Shortly afterward\r\n  young Aaron was a Mohel in his own right. He then made a\r\n  commitment that he would never decline anyone who invites him to be\r\n  Mohel. During the bitter Holocaust years whenever an opportunity\r\n  would arise he would be the Mohel. After the war in the D.P. Camps he\r\n  was appointed chief Mohel by the government and was given a car to go\r\n  all around Germany to be Mohel, he used to have up to 30 Bris's per\r\n  day. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n</pre>\r\n<br><br><br>\r\n<P><A HREF=\"hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 6/28/00</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
