From a data\nstructures point of view, however, such models are considered\nunrealistic because they hide intrinsic notions of information in the\ninput. In the standard word-RAM and cell-probe models of computation, we\nprove that the optimal query time for dynamic convex hulls is, in fact,\n&Theta;(lg&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;/&nbsp;lg&nbsp;lg&nbsp;<i>n</i>), for\npolylogarithmic update time (and word\nsize). Our lower bound is based on a reduction from the marked-ancestor\nproblem, and is one of the first data structural lower bounds for a\nnonorthogonal geometric problem. Our upper bounds follow a recent trend\nof attacking nonorthogonal geometric problems from an\ninformation-theoretic perspective that has proved central to advanced\ndata structures. Interestingly, our upper bounds are the first to\nsuccessfully apply this perspective to dynamic geometric data\nstructures, and require substantially different ideas from previous work.\n</p>\n\n<p>(Based\non <a href=\"http://people.csail.mit.edu/mip/papers/dynhull/paper.pdf\">a\npaper</a> by Demaine and P&#462;tra&#351;cu in SoCG 2007.)</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
