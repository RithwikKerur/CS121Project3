width=\"100%\">\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Install a new version of Eclipse to use with C++</b>\r\n<p>\r\nYou may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can\r\n  refer to them while downloading and installing MinGW and Eclipse.\r\nOr, just keep this document in your browser.\r\nYou should read each step completely before performing the action that it\r\n  describes.\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"100%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Eclipse: Version 4.5 (Mars)</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse download requires about 200 MB of disk space; keep it on your\r\n  machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse.\r\nWhen installed, Eclipse requires an additional 200 MB of disk space.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Downloading</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Click\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n      Eclipse</a><p>\r\n    The top of the following page will appear in your browser.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/eclipsedownloadpage0.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    In this handout we will download <b>Eclipse Standard 4.5</b> for\r\n      Mac OS X 64 Bit; if your computer uses Mac OS X (Cocoa), continue below;\r\n        otherwise look for the pull-down list showing <b>Mac OS X (Cocoa)</b>\r\n        and instead choose either <b>Windows</b> or <b>Linux</b> and then\r\n        continue below.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>64 Bit</b> (under Mac OS X) under the heading <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> (the fourth\r\n      selection from the top).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/eclipsedownloadpage.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the\r\n      institution underneath the orange <b>DOWNLOAD</b> button).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/mirror.png\">\r\n     \r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the orange <b>DOWNLOAD</b> button.\r\n    The site named here, in orange, underneath the <b>DOWNLOAD</b> button:\r\n      <b>United States - Indiana Unversity (http)</b> is the\r\n      random one chosen by the download page this time; yours may differ.\r\n    <p>\r\n    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.\r\n    This file is about 200 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you\r\n      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 5 minutes over a\r\n      cable modem).\r\n    Don't worry about the exact time as long as the download continues to make\r\n      steady progress.\r\n    In Chrome progress is shown on the bottom-left of the window, via the icon\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/downloadprogress.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    The file should appear as\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/downloadfile.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Terminate the window browsing the Eclipse download.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Eclipse\r\n      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Installing</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Double click the file <b>eclipse-cpp-mars-R-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz</b>,\r\n      the file that you just downloaded and moved.\r\n    It will unzip the file and create an <b>Eclipse</b> application, which\r\n      appears as\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/application.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Move this application into the Applications folder and put it on the\r\n      <b>dock</b> for simple access.\r\n    Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse on\r\n      your machine.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Double-click the <b>Eclipse</b> icon on the <b>Dock</b> that you just\r\n      created above.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following pop-up window will appear\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/open.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    (note it says <b>Eclipse Cpp</b> here, because I already have <b>Eclipse</b>\r\n       installed for my work with Python, so on my machine I renamed this\r\n       application <b>Eclipse Cpp</b>.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click <b>Open</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following splash screen will appear\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/splash.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    and then a <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window will appear.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/workspacelauncher.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the <b>Workspace</b> text box, your login name should appear between\r\n      <b>/users</b> and <b>/Documents\\workspace</b>, instead of my name,\r\n      <b>richardepattis</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Leave <b>unchecked</b> the \r\n      <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b> box.\r\n    Although you will use this same workspace for the entire quarter (checking\r\n      projects in and out of it), it is best to see this\r\n      <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window each time you start Eclipse, to\r\n      remind you where your workspace is located.\r\n\r\n<li>Click <b>OK</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Progress bars will appear at the bottom of the spash screen as Eclipse\r\n      loads.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Eventually the Eclipse workbench will appear with a <b>Welcome</b> tab\r\n      covering it.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/welcome.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Terminate (click <b>X</b> on) the <b>Welcome</b> tab.\r\n    <p>\r\n    You will not see the <b>Welcome</b> tab when you start Eclipse after this\r\n      first time.\r\n    You should now see the following Eclipse workbench.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/postwelcome.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Notice the <b>C/C++</b> words/icon appear on the top left (in the Window\r\n      title-bar) and below the upper right-hand corner (beneath the tool-bar).\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\nEclipse is now installed for C++.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Xcode</h3>\r\nIn this section we will download/install <b>Xcode</b>.\r\nBefore downloading <b>Xcode</b> (this software is free) you must have an\r\n  <b>itunes</b> account.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Download/Install <b>Xcode</b> by opening a browser and pasting the\r\n      following url:\r\n       <b>https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    It will pop-up the following <b>Developer</b> window.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/downloadxcode.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>View in Mac App Store &gt;</b> link.\r\n    It will bring pop-up the following <b>itunes</b> window\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/itunesxcode.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>Get</b> button (underneath the hammer).\r\n    The pop-up window will change to\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/itunesxcode2.png\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>Install App</b> button (same location).<br>\r\n    When I did this, I received the following message in a pop-up window\r\n      (because I am running Mac OS 10.9.5).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/itunesxcodeerror.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    At this point I clicked <b>OK</b> and  returned to the original\r\n      <b>Xcode</b> window, scrolled to the bottom (left), and clicked on\r\n      the <b>Additional Tools</b> link.\r\n    I was redirected to login with my <b>Apple ID</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/developerlogin.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I entered my <b>Apple ID</b> and <b>password</b> and clicked \r\n       <b>Sign In</b>.<br>\r\n    Next a pop-up window with an <b>Apple Developer Agreement</b> appeared;\r\n      I scrolled to the bottom.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/developeragreement.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I clicked the box binding me to the agreement and clicked the <b>Submit</b>\r\n      button.<br>\r\n    Next a pop-up window with various developer tools appeared.\r\n    I scrolled down to <b>Xcode 5.1</b> (dated April 9, 2014) and clicked on\r\n      the <b>+</b> to disclose the <b>Xcode 5.1.1.dmg</b> link.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/developertool5.1.1.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I clicked this link; note the download occupies 2.1Gb of storage: my\r\n       download took 30 minutes.\r\n    Then I double clicked the downloaded <b>.dmg</b> file and a pop-window\r\n      showed itself briefly.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/xcodeinstalling.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then a pop-window window asked me to drag/drop <b>Xcode</b> to\r\n      the <b>Applications</b> folder.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/xcodetoapplications.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I dragged/dropped <b>Xcode</b> to the <b>Applications</b> folder, and\r\n      a pop-up window showed itself during the copying.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/xcodecopying.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then I repeated these steps for <b>Xcode</b>'s command line developer tools.\r\n    I scrolled to\r\n     <b>Command Line Tools (OS X 10.9) for Xcode - September 2014</b>\r\n     (dated September 1, 2014) and clicked on the <b>+</b> to disclose the\r\n     link.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/developertoolcommandline.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I clicked this link; note the download occupies 102Mb of storage: my\r\n       download took just a few minutes.\r\n    Then I double clicked the downloaded <b>.dmg</b> file and a pop-window\r\n      showed itself briefly, followed by the following pop-up window.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandlineinstalling.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I double clicked the icon and the following pop-up window appeared, with\r\n      the word <b>Introduction</b> highlighed.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/introduction.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I clicked the <b>Continue</b> button,

src=\"images/installprogress.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Eventually, that window was replaced with the following pop-up window with\r\n      the word <b>Summary</b> highlighed.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/summary.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I clicked the <b>Close</b> button and terminate the\r\n      <b>Command Line Developer Tools</b> window.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Open a terminal and type (don't copy/paste) to its prompt:\r\n    <b>xcode-select --install</b> as shown below.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/xcodeselect.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    I pressed <b>return</b> and following pop-up
