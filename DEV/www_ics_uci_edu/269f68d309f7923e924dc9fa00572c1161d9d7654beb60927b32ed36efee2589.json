A ganze Megilla. Too much to read. I srolled\r\nthrough it\r\nand couldn't find Langsam. Maybe I went too fast.\r\n(This is the second letter, the first one disappeared all of a sudden while\r\nwriting)\r\nAnyway I'll give you what I have. Do you have anything with the familyname\r\nBier?\r\nI think most of it is from Germany and it starts this way:\r\n\r\n\r\nJitschok Bier, about 1685\r\nOne of his children Shimshon Jitschok Bier\r\nOne of his children David Simon Bier 1747-1823\r\nOne of his children  Jacob David Bier\r\nOne of his childdren Jacob Cossman Bier. Married Susanna Isac.\r\nSome of their children 1 David\r\n                                  2 Isaak\r\n                                  3 Rebecca bier married August Warendorf;\r\n                                    They had a daughter Sophie Warendorf who\r\nmarried a ? Langsam'\r\nThey had a son Eugene (or a daughter Eugenie?) because it is not clear if he\r\nmarried a Carla\r\nHeimann (or she married a Carl Heiman. The trail is dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am a descendant of  Jacob David Bier.\r\nOne of his children was  Sophie Bier who married Jonas Fassbender.\r\nOne of their children was Eva Fassbender who married Abraham Meyerhof, my\r\ngrandmother\r\nRosalie's parents.\r\nRosalie married Hermann Randerath. They had 4 children. One of them was\r\nLotte.\r\nShe married my father Henri van Collem from Holland. (Sounds goyish but a\r\nvery good\r\nDutch Jewish name.\r\nI am one of Henri and Lotte's children. My dad was murdered in Bergen\r\nBelsen. My mom died\r\n7 years ago at the age of 93. She my sister (in Israel) and I made it alive\r\nout of Bergen Belsen.\r\nSorry not to be able to give you anything more.\r\nI got some of my information from James Steckerl, the son of a cousin of my\r\nmother who lives in England.\r\nIf you are at all interested, let me know and I give you his e-mail.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the best, Ilse Zilversmit-nee van Collem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> =======================================================\r\n> Email posted from Family Tree of the Jewish People\r\n>\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Thu, 12 Jul 2001 22:55:43 -0400\r\nTo: \"Ilse Zilversmit\" &lt;izilver@attcanada.ca>\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Family Tree of the Jewish People: Eugen LANGSAM\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nI know that it has been a while, but can I take you up on your offer?
