Server side diffs help to cut bandwidth as they only require the finished result to be transmitted. This is not a general solution as diffs are expensive in terms of processing. However there are situations where the server may be the only entity able to perform the diff. \r\n<BR></UL><UL>\r\nA means is also needed to return generic diff information, VTML is an ideal candidate for this. VTML also handles the case of diffs with more than two entities. It seems logical to implement a Get specific header to provide this functionality.\r\n</UL><UL>\r\nClient side diffs do not require any special functionality and can be performed by \u2018Get\u2019ting the file and performing the diff. </UL> </P> \r\n\r\n</Body>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
