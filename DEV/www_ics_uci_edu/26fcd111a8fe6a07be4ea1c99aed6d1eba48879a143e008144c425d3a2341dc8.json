Trade secrets</h3>\n<pre>\n \n   28. Trade secrets---(1) Subject to subsection (2) of this section, an \n agency may refuse to disclose any information requested pursuant to \n principle 6 if the withholding of the information is necessary to \n protect information where the making available of the information--- \n   (a) Would disclose a trade secret; or \n   (b) Would be likely unreasonably to prejudice the commercial position \n         of the person who supplied or who is the subject of the \n         information. \n \n   (2) Information may not be withheld under subsection (1) of this \n section if, in the circumstances of the particular case, the withholding \n of that information is outweighed by other considerations which render \n it desirable, in the public interest, to make the information available. \n     Cf. 1982, No. 156, s. 27 (1) (a); 1987, No. 8, s. 4 (2); 1987, No. \n       174, s. 26 (1) (a) \n</pre>\n<h3>Section 29. Other reasons for refusal of requests</h3>\n<pre> \n   29. Other reasons for refusal of requests---(1) An agency may refuse \n to disclose any information requested pursuant to principle 6 if--- \n   (a) The disclosure of the information would involve the unwarranted \n         disclosure of the affairs of another individual or of a deceased \n         individual; or \n   (b) The disclosure of the information or of information identifying \n         the person who supplied it, being evaluative material, would \n         breach an express or implied promise--- \n           (i) Which was made to the person who supplied the information; \n         and \n           (ii) Which was to the effect that the information or the \n         identity of the person who supplied it or both would be held in \n         confidence; or \n   (c) After consultation undertaken (where practicable) by or on behalf \n         of the agency with an individual's medical practitioner, the \n         agency is satisfied that--- \n           (i) The information relates to that individual; and \n           (ii) The disclosure of the information (being information that \n         relates to the physical or mental health of the individual who \n         requested it) would be likely to prejudice the physical or \n         mental health of that individual; or \n   (d) In the case of an individual under the age of 16, the disclosure \n         of that information would be contrary to that individual's \n         interests; or \n   (e) The disclosure of that information (being information in respect \n         of an individual who has been convicted of an offence or is or \n         has been detained in custody) would be likely to prejudice the \n         safe custody or the rehabilitation of that individual; or \n   (f) The disclosure of the information would breach legal professional \n         privilege; or \n   (g) In the case of a request made to Radio New Zealand Limited or \n         Television New Zealand Limited, the disclosure of the \n         information would be likely to reveal the source of information \n         of a bona fide news media journalist and either--- \n           (i) The information is subject to an obligation of confidence; \n         or \n           (ii) The disclosure of the information would be likely to \n         prejudice the supply of similar information, or information from \n         the same source; or \n   (h) The disclosure of the information, being information contained in \n         material placed in any library or museum or archive, would \n         breach a condition subject to which that material was so placed; \n         or \n   (i) The disclosure of the information would constitute contempt of \n         Court or of the House of Representatives; or \n   (j) The request is frivolous or vexatious, or the information \n         requested is trivial. \n \n   (2) An agency may refuse a request made pursuant to principle 6 if--- \n   (a) The information requested is not readily retrievable; or \n   (b) The information requested does not exist or cannot be found; or \n   (c) The information requested is not held by the agency and the person \n         dealing with the request has no grounds for believing that the \n         information is either--- \n           (i) Held by another agency; or \n           (ii) Connected more closely with the functions or activities \n         of another agency. \n \n   (3) For the purposes of subsection (1) (b) of this section, the term \n ``evaluative material'' means evaluative or opinion material compiled \n solely--- \n   (a) For the purpose of determining the suitability, eligibility, or \n         qualifications of the individual to whom the material relates--- \n           (i) For employment or for appointment to office; or \n           (ii) For promotion in employment or office or for continuance \n         in employment or office; or \n           (iii) For removal from employment or office; or \n           (iv) For the awarding of contracts, awards, scholarships, \n         honours, or other benefits; or \n   (b) For the purpose of determining whether any contract, award, \n         scholarship, honour, or benefit should be continued, modified, \n         or cancelled; or \n   (c) For the purpose of deciding whether to insure any individual or \n         property or to continue or renew the insurance of any individual \n         or property. \n     Cf. 1982, No. 156, ss. 18 (c) (ii), (e), (g), (h), 27 (1) (b)-(h), \n       (2); 1987, No. 8, s. 15 (1); 1987, No. 174, ss. 17 (c) (ii), (e), \n       (g), (h), 26 (1) (b)-(h), (2) \n</pre>\n<h3>Section 30. Refusal not permitted for any other reason</h3>\n<pre> \n   30. Refusal not permitted for any other reason---Subject to sections \n 7, 31, and 32 of this Act, no reasons other than one or more of the \n reasons set out in sections 27 to 29 of this Act justifies a refusal to \n disclose any information requested pursuant to principle 6. \n     Cf. 1982, No. 156, s. 27 (1A); 1987, No. 8, s. 15 (2); 1987, No. \n       174, s. 26 (2) \n</pre>\n<pre>&nbsp;</pre>\n<hr>\n<address>GP Print, Wellinton.</address>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
