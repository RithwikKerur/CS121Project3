Each agent's heading is updated\nusing a local rule based on the average of its own heading plus the\nheadings of its \"neighbors\". In their paper, Vicsek et al. provide\nsimulation results which demonstrate that the nearest neighbor rule\nthey are studying can cause all agents to eventually move in the same\ndirection despite the absence of centralized coordination and despite\nthe fact that each agent's set of nearest neighbors change with time\nas the system evolves. This paper provides a theoretical explanation\nfor this observed behavior. In addition, convergence results are\nderived for several other similarly inspired models. The Vicsek model\nproves to be a graphic example of a switched linear system which is\nstable, but for which there does not exist a common quadratic Lyapunov\nfunction.</p>\n\n<p>(Based\non <a href=\"http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~jadbabai/papers/cdc02-INV2101.pdf\">a\npaper</a> by Jadbabaie, Lin, and Morse in the <i>IEEE Conference on\nDecision and Control</i>, 2002, and <i>IEEE Transactions on\nAutomatic Control</i>, 2003.
