Below is a list\nof items that should be included in your first deliverable.\n<BR>\n<HR>\n<H3>\nDue Date</H3>\nJanuary 21 1999, Thursday, in class\n<BR>\n<HR>\n<H3>\nObjectives</H3>\nThe purpose of this document is to convince your customer (and since you\nare at school, your instructor) that you have a good understanding of what\nthe project is all about and that your team is qualified to do this project.\n<BR>\n<HR WIDTH=\"100%\">\n<H3>\nUnderstanding</H3>\nOne of your major tasks for the current period of time is developing an\nunderstanding of the various technologies and tasks concerned with your\nproject. This includes the tools and techniques that you will use in accomplishing\nyour task as well as the technologies that you will be extending, enhancing,\nor changing.\n\n<P>In this deliverable you should reflect your newly gained understanding\nby writing an introduction to your project that highlights its various\nimportant aspects. You should also include a description of activities\ndone in support of developing understanding - like interviews with the\ncustomer, for example. (One of the best ways, of course, to gain an understanding\nof a piece of software is to interview the original developer.)\n<BR>\n<HR>\n<H3>\nTechnical Marketing Sheet</H3>\nInclude a one or two page technical marketing sheet (a bit more technical\nthan a \"sales brochure\") suitable for describing your product to a technically\nliterate outside audience. This document should be successful in reflecting\nthat you really understand what problem is being solved and can articulate\nhow your product will add value.\n<BR>\n<HR>\n<H3>\nProject Plan</H3>\nUse the outline below in presenting your project plan.\n<OL>\n<LI>\nIntroduction</LI>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\nScope and Purpose of Document (overview)</LI>\n\n<LI>\nProject Summary</LI>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\nObjectives</LI>\n\n<LI>\nMajor Activities</LI>\n\n<LI>\nManagement and Technical Constraints</LI>\n</OL>\n</OL>\n\n<LI>\nProject Risks</LI>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\nRisk Analysis</LI>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\nIdentification (what is the risk?)</LI>\n\n<LI>\nRisk Estimation (how big a consequence would it have?)</LI>\n\n<LI>\nEvaluation (how likely is it to occur?)</LI>\n</OL>\n\n<LI>\nRisk Management</LI>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\nRisk Aversion Options (what can you do to avoid it?)</LI>\n\n<LI>\nRisk Monitoring Procedures (how do you keep track of whether it is going\nto occur?)</LI>\n</OL>\n</OL>\n\n<LI>\nSchedule</LI>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\nProject Work Breakdown Structure</LI>\n\n<LI>\nTask Network (include more detail than just your major deliverables)</LI>\n\n<LI>\nTime-Line Chart (when are you going to deliver your various work products?)</LI>\n\n<LI>\nResource Table (how is each team member going to be applied throughout\nthe weeks of the project?)</LI>\n\n\n<P>(You could use a tool like Microsoft Project to help you with parts\nof this task.)</OL>\n\n<LI>\nProject Estimates</LI>\n\n<OL>\n<LI>\nHistorical Data used for the Estimates (personal data? team data? application-domain\ndata (from other projects?))</LI>\n\n<LI>\nEstimation Techniques</LI>\n\n<LI>\nEstimates (how long is each sub-task going to take?)</LI>\n</OL>\n\n<LI>\nProject Resources</LI>\n\n<UL>\n<LI>\nPeople (who is on the team?)</LI>\n\n<LI>\nHardware and Software</LI>\n\n<LI>\nSpecial Resources</LI>\n</UL>\n\n<LI>\nStaff Organization</LI>\n\n<UL>\n<LI>\nTeam Structure (what is the team's organizational structure?
