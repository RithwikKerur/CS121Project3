We anticipate \nan environment where traveling vehicles communicate among themselves, \nforming rapidly changing ad hoc network topologies.\nSeveral cars travel on a highway while communicating locally via an \nad hoc wireless network\nEach car is equipped with a laptop or PDA equipped with a wireless LAN card\n(e.g., 802.11) for local communication\nand forms, around itself, a local area of communication. \nCars that are further away, although they may constitute part of a neighbor's \nlocal area, are not part of that particular car's communication network. \nAll cars broadcast information omni-directionally and receive data from any \nand every direction. There is no point-to-point communication link. \nThe purpose of the ad hoc network is to impart information, i.e., the car's \nvital signs, to vehicles in close proximity and to receive the same data \nfrom them. The information is processed locally to provide the driver \nwith a map indicating the status of each car in the \nimmediate vicinity, e.g., acceleration, turning signal status, braking, etc.\n<br>\n<br>\nWe are faced with a very dynamic environment composed of fast-moving vehicles, \nwhich, from the communication perspective, translates into rapidly changing \nnetwork topologies. In addition, the data that is exchanged between the \nvehicles is time sensitive. \nSince the communication devices are mounted in vehicles, power supply is \npractically unlimited thus making it possible to use fairly large antennas \nand on-board GPS devices. Also, the data is really of interest only to a \nsmall circle of neighboring vehicles. \n<br>\n<br>\nAlthough the problem is simplified by the single-hop nature of the network \nand the consequent lack of routing, it also raises some concerns, \nprimarily, the throughput of the system and the delays involved. \nSince data is time-sensitive, and in many cases, urgent in nature \n(e.g., speeding vehicle approaching in left lane), the system must be \nrobust and capable to support the traffic load and its time critical needs. \nTradeoffs to be investigated involve the type of data, its urgency and the \npractical limits of the system before it degenerates into chaos and data \nflow comes to a halt. More complex, multi-channel systems capable of coping \nwith the traffic load and its delay constraints, pose a different set of \nproblems associated with the speed with which vehicles can associate \nthemselves to the different channels and maintain an up-to-date \npicture of their surroundings.\n</body>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
