We could call these\nthree themes design (How do we represent our problem so we can solve it\nwith software?), implementation (How do we decide which of the many alternatives\nwould be best for building this solution?), and communication (How can we\ncharacterize our solution, especially its efficiency in consuming machine\nresources under various conditions, in a way that other informaticians will\nunderstand?). </FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">This quarter's offering of Informatics 42 is unique because it will use the language Python. The School of ICS plans to teach Python in all its first-year courses starting in Fall 2012; students in this course get to make the transition early. Informatics 45 next quarter will continue in Python but will also do some work in Java (which will be much easier to learn at that point).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  This course\nexpects Informatics 41 as a prerequisite.

(The earlier version, Python 2.7, is not compatible although it remains in wide use. Bear this in mind if you do your own searching for references; you'll get messed up if you read materials about Python 2 instead of Python 3.) The python.org site has <a href=\"http://python.org/download/releases/3.2.2/\">download information</a> for those who wish to install Python on their own machines.

It&#39;s\n    not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat lecture material you missed, though\nof course he will answer questions about it.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Attend your lab section, too, since your partner depends on your presence.\n<!-- assignments will be discussed and completed there, exams will be reviewed\nthere, and you can hear a different perspective there than you can in lecture.-->\nDon&#39;t hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Check your electronic mail regularly; this\nis an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Keep up with the reading; you&#39;ll need it\nto do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed\npages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#39;re not careful.  Our\ntext contains some details that won&#39;t be vital for your work.  You will\nwant to read the assigned sections early and quickly (for the main ideas,\nnot to memorize every detail); then you can ask your TA in section which\nparts merit closer attention.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">The assignments, like all technical specifications,\nrequire careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back\nto the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about\nwhat&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure\nto read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Start each assignment early.  Programming always\ntakes longer to complete than you think it will, even if you have previous\nprogramming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll have time to ask\nin discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">If you find yourself having trouble or getting\nbehind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  But <I>never</I> take the\nshortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and turning it in; the consequences\ncan be far worse than just a low score on a lab assignment.  ICS takes academic\nhonesty very seriously; for a more complete discussion, see the ICS departmental\nweb page covering academic honesty issues (</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=2><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Always keep your own copy of each assignment,\nboth electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\nshuffle (or if the Checkmate server should crash),\nwe&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.  Finally,\nturn in whatever portion of the assignment you have completed on the due\ndate.  In some circumstances you may arrange with your TA to work further\non an assignment after the due date, but you must turn in whatever you have\nwhen the official due date comes.   </FONT></P>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Very approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=1 WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=1>\n<COL WIDTH=7%><COL WIDTH=14%><COL WIDTH=79%>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=7% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Week</U></FONT></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=14% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Date</U></FONT></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=79% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Topics (and chapters in the Perkovic (P) and Downey (D) texts)</U></FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=7% VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
