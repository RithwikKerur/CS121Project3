Alexander</H3>\n</center>\n\nIn September 15, 1802 Joseph of the family of David and Dobrysh daughter of the \nJacobs, he living in building number 203, she in building number 205 in the Jewish Town \nin the Kazimierz district of Krakow, Poland, were married and their marriage was \nrecorded in the official records. Apparently, they were neighbors. He was 19 at the time, \nshe was 18, i.e. he was born in 1783, she in 1784. In an official census of 1804 Krakow, \nincluding the Jewish Town, had 25,750 inhabitants. Jews constituted 4,300 of that \nnumber, or 16.7%. As I have found in my genealogical research, a number of the Jewish \nfamilies in Krakow were closely related. \n<P>\nAt the time neither Joseph nor Dobrysh used a last name. As a matter of fact few Krakow \nJews had family names in 1800, most used patronymics or nicknames, sometimes family \nnicknames which eventually came to be used as surnames, sometimes names of an \nimportant or famous family member which served to identify the family for generations. \nKrakow, the old royal capital of Poland, was occupied by the Austrian Habsburg armies \nin 1796. It became a part of the so-called Kingdom of Galitzia and Lodomeria, named \nafter the old Ruthenian towns of Halicz and Wladimir, in German Galitsch and Lodomir. \nA few years earlier, in 1787, the Austrian Emperor Joseph II ordered that all his subjects \nmust get surnames, and gradually Krakow Jews adopted, or were assigned, surnames. \nSince these were assigned by Austrian officials most of the surnames had Germanic \nroots: Goldman, Rosenfeld, Birnbaum, Greenberg, Schwartzstein, etc. Some last names, \nhowever, were derived from patronymics (Jacobs, Wolfson, Gimbels, etc), professions \n(Schneider, Tischler, Goldschmidt, etc) or places of family origin (Frankfurter, Dresdner, \nLemberger, etc), using either German (and Yiddish) or Polish endings. In German and \nYiddish the patronymics would end in \"s\" (Meisels, Pearls, etc), in Polish in \"wicz\" \n(Gumplowicz,  Jakubowicz, etc). In addition, in Slavic usage, married women would \nhave the suffix \"owa\" and unmarried women the suffix \"owna\". Thus, for example, the \nprominent Krakovian Jewish sage, Remuh, was the son of Israel ben Joseph, nicknamed \n\"Isserl\", and became known as Reb Moses \"Isserl's\" or Isserless (1525-1572). His \ndescendants used \"Isserless\" for generations to identify themselves with the famous sage. \nBerek, the famous Jewish officer in Kosciuszko's and Napoleon's Polish army, son of \nJosel, was known as Berek Joselewicz. Dobrysh, daughter of Jacob Gompl later known as \nGumplowicz,  was referred to as Dobrysh z  Jakubow (i.e. of the Jacobs) or as Dobrysh z \nGomplowiczow.\n<P>\nI was interested in the couple married in 1802, because I had reason to believe that they \nwere my direct ancestors. In October 1997 I spent a month in the Krakow branch of the \nPolish National Archives, where I found a wealth of original documents, showing the \nclear line of succession from Joseph and Dobrysh to my father and me. Joseph and his \ndescendants eventually began using the family name of Aleksandrowicz (or \nAlexandrowicz with an \"x\", as it was spelled in older documents). I and my family lived \nin Krakow until the Second World War. I survived the Holocaust, while most of my \nfamily perished. In 1946 I came to the United States and, in time, abbreviated the family \nname to Alexander. I was in Krakow in 1997 trying to find out how long has my family \nlived in Krakow and how was it related to other Krakovian Jewish families.\n<P>\nJoseph Aleksandrowicz's surname appeared in official records gradually. In the earliest \nmention that I could find, in the Austrian census of 1796 he was shown as a child of 10, \npart of family # 46, living in building # 9 in Kazimierz. It is likely that his father was \nnamed Herschel, age 32, i.e. born around 1762. Herschel's father, the patriarch of family \n# 46 at the time, was David son of Joseph, then living with Herschel in Building 9. David \nwas then 70 years old, i.e. he was born around 1726. His father, Joseph must have died \nbefore 1786, since that name was used for the child of 10. No surnames were used in this \nrecord. In the wedding record of 1802 the groom was listed as Joseph of the family of \nDavid. In September 21, 1807, in the record of birth of Joseph's daughter Temerle, he  \nwas listed as Joseph \"Alexa\". In  1811, in the long and detailed birth certificate of his \ndaughter Gele, and in 1813 in the birth certificate of another daughter, Hana, he was \nlisted as Jozef Alexander (he signed the documents \"Joseph Alexander or Alexanderr\") \nand finally, in the record of the birth of his first son and my great-great-grandfather, \nMenashe (recorded at birth as Samuel Aaron), in July 23, 1818, as Jozef Alexandrowicz. \nIt took me more time to find the maiden name of Dobrysh. In the wedding record she was \nDobrusch. In the Austrian census of 1796 she was listed as Dobosch, age 9, daughter of \nJacob Guempel. As mother in the birth record of her first daughter, Schoendel, in April \n24, 1805, she was listed as Feigle. As mother of Temerle, in 1807 she appeared as \nFreindel. I found that in 1809 she had another daughter, Rywka, but no birth certificate of \nRywka Aleksandrowicz is extant (I found about Rywka's existence from her 1831 \nmarriage record). In the certificate of Gele in1811 she appeared as Doba of the Jacobs (\"z \nJakubow\"), born around 1784. In 1813 record of the birth of Hana Aleksandrowicz, the \nmother was listed as Dobrysz z Jakubow. In an equally detailed record of the birth of her \nson in 1818 she was shown as Dobrosz z Jacobow. In 1821, in the record of birth of the \nsecond son, Izrael Elias, born August 11, she was listed as Dobresz Jakubowna. From all \nthese, I knew that her father was Jacob (diminutive, Jankel), but her eventual family \nname remained a mystery, until I found a 1831 document, the detailed record of bans and \nmarriage of Rywka Aleksandrowicz.\n<P>\nWith passage of time, usage of surnames increased, although they were not necessarily \nshown in all the records. In a document registering the wedding of Temerle \nAleksandrowicz with Moses Hercig (Hertzog?), son of Hersh and Rywka, in 1827, it was \nstated that the bride's father, Josel Alexandrowicz, was deceased, but the mother, \nFreindel Dobrysz, was alive and living in Building 203 in Kazimierz. It was only in the \nnext family document, the marriage record of Rywka Polner, nee Alexandrowicz, and \nFaywel Orgler, son of Shachna and Rachel, dated March 11, 1831, that the bride's mother \nwas listed as Dobress z Gomplowiczow (Dobress of the Gomplowiczes), a widow, a \ndealer in assorted merchandise, living in building 203. This was my first indication that \nmy ancestress Dobrysh, daughter of Jacob and wife of Jozef Aleksandrowicz, mother of \nMenashe Aleksandrowicz and grandmother of Jozef, Fillip and Wolf Aleksandrowicz, \nwas the Dobosch listed in the Austrian census as daughter of the well-known  historic \npersonality, Jacob Gumplowicz of Krakow.\n<P>\nMoses Hertzig was born on June 9, 1809 to Hirsch and Rifka Hercig. The Hertzigs were a \nlarge family in Krakow: Hirsh's brothers Isaac, Lazar and Abraham all were recorded as \nhaving had children in Krakow between 1805 and 1811. Feivel Orgler's registration (he \nwas born on August 27, 1806) was witnessed by his grandfather, Salomon Orgler, who \nwas born around 1761. On page 78 of the 1812 record of births in Kazimierz, Salomon \nOrgler, owner of building # 128, presented a baby that was born in his building to one  \nWolf Krengel.\n<P>\nJacob Gumplowicz, was described in the classic history of Krakow Jewry by Meyer \nBalaban as a rich man, a supplier of the Krakow mint, co-owner of a firm that went \nbankrupt in 1790. He did not use Gumplowicz as his family name at that point. He was \nrecorded in the Austrian census of 1796 as Jacob Guempel, age 36, i.e. born around 1758, \nfamily # 551, living in building 106, married to Sara of the family of the Abeles, age 30, \ni.e. born around 1766. in other official documents, such as the birth records of his \nchildren he was referred to as Jacob Gimple or Gompl, living in building 205. Only after \n1805, did the name Gumplowicz appear as a surname. In 1793 Jacob received a coveted \nright to sell alcohol in bottles. He was obviously a prominent citizen in spite of his \nbankruptcy. His family remained prominent in Krakow to our times. To marry his \ndaughter in 1802, a young man must also have been either a scion of a wealthy family or \na famous scholar. Jozef later known as Aleksandrowicz did not make a name for himself \nas a scholar, hence, his parents must have been well off.  In most records, Jozef was listed \nas a merchant, however in the bans announcement of his son Menashe to Lea Katzner, \ndated March 3, 1844, he was listed as his deceased father, who had been an owner of a \nbuilding in Kazimierz. The Jewish area of Kazimierz was very crowded. Houses were \nprecious and each house had many tenants. To own a building implied wealth. I believe \nthat the building that Jozef owned was the one he lived in, No. 203. We know from the \nPolish 1790 census that it was a substantial building with at least eight apartments. \nBetween 1804 and 1881 many members of the Aleksandrowicz family lived there.    \n<P>\nI have not been able to find out when Joseph or Dobrysh Aleksandrowicz, nee \nGumplowicz , died. He was shown as deceased in 1827, she was alive in 1847. In a \ncensus she was listed as living with her son, Manasse Alexandrowicz, in Apartment 2 in \nBuilding 203, in District 11 of  Krakow. I found no further documents that mention her. \nInasmuch as most of Krakow Jewish tombstones as well as funeral and cemetery records \nwere destroyed by the Nazis, it is unlikely that any further traces of  Freindel Dobrysh \nAleksandrowicz, daughter of Jacob Gumplowicz, and great-grandmother of the \nAleksandrowicz clan of Krakow, Poland, will be found.\n<P>\nJoseph and Dobrysh had five daughters, Scheindel, Temerl, Rywka, Gele and Hana, and \ntwo sons, Menashe and Israel Elias. In June 13, 1827 Temerl married Moses Hercig. \nRywka married Michael Polner who died young in the plague. In 1831, as a widow, aged \nonly 22, she remarried. Her new husband was Faiywel Orgler, age 25. Menashe \nAleksandrowicz married Lea, daughter of Wolf Katzner, born in 1818. Menashe was a \nmerchant, but he also served as \"pisarz kantoru loteryi\"(exactly translated as \"writer of a \nlottery office\", but which I believe meant that he was the concessionaire of the state \nlottery, for which right he must have paid a large sum). Menashe and Leah had four sons, \nJoseph, born in 1845, who married Rachel Drezner, David, born in 1847, who must have \ndied young, Feivel (Fillip), born in 1849, who married Dorothea Frankel, and Wolf, born \nin 1851, who married Regina Hirsch. Joseph, Fillip and Wolf had a large number of \noffspring living in Krakow. I remember my great-grandfather Joseph as an old man. He \ndied of natural causes in 1940. Joseph's son Jacob (1866-1935) married Hanna Hinda \nBirnbaum (1866-1923). They had seven children. My father, Maxymilian \nAleksandrowicz (1902-1968), was their sixth child. He married my mother, Salomea \nScheindel Rubin (1900-1942), daughter of Isaac Rosenberg, son a rabbi in Klasno by \nWieliczka near Krakow.\n<P>\nAt the end of the eighteenth century exact spelling was not considered important. In \nparticular, transliterations from Hebrew to the Latin alphabet varied considerably. \nInasmuch as Hebrew does not contain vowels, only consonants were fixed, vowels were \ntranslated with considerable latitude. Thus, the family name of the husband of Temerl \nAleksandrowicz, Hercig (pronounced \"Hertzig\" in Polish) could also be legitimately \ntranscribed as Hertzog, which sounds better to us today. The name Dobrysh was spelled \nin various documents Dobosch, Doba, Dobrosz, Dobrysz, Dobress, etc.  Apparently, the \nexact age was also not considered important, and different documents show ages of \nindividuals vary considerably.\n<P>\nI believe that the Austrian census, which Balaban's history lists as of 1796, was actually \nprepared over two or three years after 1795. Similarly, the earlier Polish census of 1790 \nwas actually prepared between 1790 and 1792. In the Austrian census Jacob Guempel \nhad a son named Lebelle (Yiddish form would be Leibl), age 15 (i.e.born around 1781), \nand a daughter, Dobosch, age 9 (i.e. born around 1786). He had another daughter, Feigl, \nbetween 1792 and 1794, but she is not listed in this census. This Feigl married Ruben \nPitzele. Krakow birth records for year 1801 show that on November 11 Jacob Gumple \nand his wife Sara, living in Building 205 had a child named Abele. In 1803, on March 3, \nJacob Gimpl and Sara had a son whom they registered as Juda Leib. By 1805 the family \nname first appears as \"Gumplowicz\". In 1805 Jacob's son, Leibl Gumplowicz and wife \nRoesl, also living in Building 205, had a daughter named Channa.   According to later \nrecords, including the record of birth of Ludwik Gumplowicz of March 22, 1838, \nLudwik's father, Abraham (Abele?), listed as 35 years old, married Henrietta \"Inlainder\", \nage 28, which means that she was born in 1810. Records for 1810 show the birth of a girl \nborn to Simon Englander and his wife Muendel on the last day of the year, December 31, \nwhom they named Malka Izybel. This is likely to be the Henrietta who married Abraham \nGumplowicz. In 1810 Simon Englander, living in large, multi-story building # 69,  was \n48, his wife 40, thus he was born in 1762, she in 1770. Records show that they had earlier \nchildren, Samuel, born in 1806, Zwettel, born December 2, 1807 and Nachum, born \nDecember 27, 1808. Zwettel Englander married at 21, on July 14, 1829, to Hirsh David \nHotschner. Hanna Gumplowicz, daughter of Leibl and Roesl married Moses Fromer on \nMarch 8, 1825.\n<P>\nMeyer Balaban mentions that in 1811 a member of the Gumplowicz family, Joachim, \noffered to pay 35,750 Polish zlotys annually, an enormous sum at that time, for the right \nto collect a tax for consumption of vodka, beer, beef and flour. Balaban also mentions \nthat in 1840 Abraham Gumplowicz, a prominent merchant, liberal in his religious beliefs \nand interested in wordly cultural events, founded a lending library of Polish and German \nnovels and other books, which continued to exist until 1939. As a child, in Krakow in the \n1930's I used to borrow books from the Gumplowicz library on Bracka Street. Abraham \nGumplowicz helped to found the modern reformed synagogue, the Tempel, with a choir \nand an organ. I remember visiting the Tempel in the 1930's with my uncle Jozek. This \nTempel survived the war and is now being renovated as a synagogue and a concert hall \nby the Lauder Foundation. Ludwik Gumplowicz (1838-1909) became a renown scholar, \nthe founder of the modern science of sociology. He became a professor at the University \nof Graz in Austria.\n<P>\nBesides Dobrysh, Jacob and Sara Gimpl/Gumplowicz, living in building 205 in \nKazimierz, had another daughter, Feigl, born around 1792, who married Ruben Pitzele \n(or Picele). Ruben was born in Krakow around 1788. Balaban mentions that during the \nPolish November Uprising against the Russian Tsars in 1831, which caused excitement \nand unrest in the Austrian part of Poland, Ruben, along with Moses Alexander, served in \nKrakow in the town guard, maintaining order and protecting Jewish merchants in town. \nRuben Pitzele and Feigl daughter of Jacob Gumplowicz, living in Building # 134, had a \nson, Aba, on July 14, 1809, another, Joseph, on November 1, 1811 and still another, \nDavid, on January 26 1813. Apparently, they also had a daughter, Dina Rywka, on April \n22, 1832, and a son, Isaac, on October 31, 1833.  Ruben's father was Simon Pitzele. \nSimon had an older son, Israel, born around 1782 and a daughter also named Feigl, born \naround 1783, who married Asher Drezner, a teacher of Jewish children in Krakow. Asher \nwas born in 1777. He was the father of Shaya Jozua Drezner and grandfather of two of \nmy grandmothers, Rachel Drezner Aleksandrowicz and Malka Drezner Birnbaum. Israel \nPicele and his wife Heydl, also living in building 134, had a son Jacob Simon on May 26, \n1809.\n<P>\nAsher Drezner's son, Shaya Jozua Drezner, the father of Rachel and Malka Drezner, as \nwell as of Feigl Golda (Gina) Drezner and of Hana Drezner, was born September 12, \n1813. Both his uncles, Israel and Ruben Pitzele served as witnesses when his birth was \nregistered. Shaya became a tavern keeper and liquor merchant in Krakow. On June 17, \n1832, at the age of 19, he married the youthful, 16-year old, Henna Bader, born June 18, \n1816, daughter of Abraham and Reizl Bader of Krakow. This wedding was witnessed by \nIsrael Pitzele's son, Jacob Simon. Shaya's daughter Rachel (Reisl) married Jozef \nAleksandrowicz, son of Menashe; his daughter Malka married Isaac Mendel Birnbaum, \nson of Saul Zelig Birnbaum. Malka and Isaac Mendel had seven children when Malka \nsuddenly died. After Malka's death Isaac Mendel married her sister, Feigl Golda, with \nwhom he had four  more children. Besides Shaya, Asher and Henna Drezner had two \ndaughters, Schoendel, born May 2, 1806, who on January 8, 1821 married Isaac Ber \nKotzitz, born in 1803, and Reisl, born July 20, 1809, and two sons, Simon, born March \n24, 1812 and Schachna, born 1818. \n<P>\nIsaac Mendel Birnbaum, the man who married two of Asher Drezner's granddaughters, \nwas the son of Saul (Zelig) Birnbaum (1788-1884) and grandson of Berek Birnbaum. \nBerek also had a daughter, Golda, born around 1794, who married Jozef Bader. Saul \nZelig married a Krakow girl named Beyla Gela Tislowitz, born in 1798. In addition to \nIsaac Mendel, Saul Zelig and Beyla Gela had three boys and three girls: Chaya, born \n1814, Leah, born 1818, Ensel born in 1820, Wolf born in 1826, Rachel, born 1828 and \nAbraham Samuel, born 1829. Wolf had two children, Abraham Samuel had a girl, Hanna, \nborn in 1845.\n<P>\nThe period around 1800 was an eventful period. In America a free people elected their \nthird president. In 1794 Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a hero of the American Revolution, led a \nPolish insurrection from Krakow against the Russian invaders of Poland. With his \nAmerican experience Kosciuszko knew that wars can not be won by a few noblemen \nalone. In Poland, he tried to form an army of nobles, as well as peasants and Jews. To the \npeasants he offered freedom from serfdom, to the Jews emancipation and equality. He \nformed a Jewish battalion led by Colonel Berek Joselewicz. After initial successes, the \nKosciuszko armies were defeated by superior forces. By 1796 Poland was eliminated \nfrom the map of Europe. Warsaw fell to the Prussians, Krakow was occupied by the \narmies of Austria. Soon, however, Napoleon Bonaparte crowned himself Emperor of \nFrance and, after defeating Prussia, formed an independent Duchy of Warsaw from \nrecovered Polish lands. In 1809, after defeating the Austrians at Wagram, he added \nKrakow to the Varsovian Duchy. Also in 1809, Colonel Berek Joselewicz died in the \nbattle of Kotzk. After Napoleon's defeat  Poland fell to the Russian Tsar. However, the \nAustrians did not want Russia to have Krakow, so the Congress of Vienna in 1815 \ncreated an autonomous city-state, the \"Free, independent, and strictly neutral Krakow \nrepublic\". This city-state existed until 1846, when it became a part of Austrian Galitzia.\n<P>\nI have indicated a complex web of relationships between Krakow Jewish families around \nthe year 1800. At any given time, at least three generations of any families are likely to \nlive at the same time. The couple married in 1802 had six children. Perhaps they had \nmore, but I found hard evidence for only six. The next generation, if all married and had a \nsimilar number of children, would number thirty six. In one more generation the number \nwould reach two hundred and sixteen. Most, if not all, continued to live in Krakow. The \ntotal for three generations was 254. If the other families behaved similarly, the number of \nthird generation relatives living in the Jewish Town in Kazimierz by Krakow would have \nbeen at least 2,794. In 1804 Krakow had 4,300 Jews, in 1815 4,862. My close relatives \nobviously constituted a significant portion of that total. Not quite keeping up with the \ngeometric progression, the number of Krakow Jews rose by 1835 to 10,952, representing \n30.4% of the total population of 36,027. In 1850 the Jewish population of Krakow, \n13,425, constituted 33.8% of the total number of inhabitants. In 1939, at the outbreak of \nthe Second World war, after three more generations, the number of Jews in Krakow was \napproximately 65,000, in a total population of 240,000. A large number of these \nKrakovian Jews must have been my relatives.\n<P>\nSad to relate, there are hardly any Jews left in Krakow today. The Jewish Community \nCenter has 189 registered members, mostly elderly. There are in Krakow a few Jews who \ndo not readily admit to their Jewish origin and a number who married non-Jews. There \nexists in Krakow a Jewish Historical Institute, hosting cultural events and festivals and a \nJewish branch of the Polish National Museum. The Krakow Jagiellonian University has a \nresearch center devoted to Poland's Jewish history. There are a few pseudo-Jewish \nrestaurants and a small, old functioning synagogue, usually closed and locked. But the \nonce vibrant, exciting Jewish culture in Krakow is no more and I do not see any future for \nJewish life in Krakow. A history of almost a thousand years (coins with Hebrew letters \nexisted in Poland around the year 1000) has come to an abrupt end.\n<P>\n\nBibliography:\n<P>\nPrimary sources:\n<P>\nMostly found in the Polish National Archives in Krakow, ul.
