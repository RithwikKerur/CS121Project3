This small seminar\nintroduced non-major honors students to concepts and current issues of computer\nscience, culminating in a field study project applying computing to an area\nof the student&#39;s interest.  &#160; </FONT></P>\n<BR><BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2><B>Background:  </B>The UCLA Honors Collegium\noffers a series of small seminar classes, designed to provide honors students\nwith the opportunity for close interaction with distinguished faculty on\ninterdisciplinary topics.  Roughly a dozen courses per quarter are offered,\nwith titles ranging from &quot;The Geometry of Relativity&quot; through\n&quot;Mind, Brains, Humans, and Computers&quot; and &quot;Human Dimensions\nof Global Environmental Change&quot; to &quot;Gender and Race:  Construction\nof Greek Political Thought.&quot;  Students with grade-point averages of\nat least 3.0 out of 4.0 who have completed their English Composition requirements\nare eligible.  Faculty from a wide range of disciplines teach in the Honors\nCollegium, their time reimbursed to their home departments.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2><B>Course description:  </B>From 1986 through\n1991, the author taught an Honors Collegium course called &quot;Computers,\nScience, and Computer Science,&quot; which was described in the catalog\nas follows:  &quot;This course will furnish students with an in-depth, fundamental\nunderstanding of computers and the nature of automatic computation, both\nin theory and in current practice:  what information computers can represent\nand how they can process it; the distinctions between human thought and\nthe computer&#39;s processing; the social effects of computerization and\nreliance on computed results; the capabilities and limitations of computer\ntechnology both today and in the future.  Students will develop the foundation\nfor making informed decisions relating to computing and the framework for\ndeveloping further technical expertise.&quot;\n<BR>\nThe rationale behind this grandiose agenda is partly to help students appreciate\nsome of the intellectual issues that underlie computer science.  But there\nis also a more practical purpose:  The students in this course do not plan\nto become computing professionals, but as university students they will\nprobably manage computing professionals, make purchasing and other management\ndecisions about computing, and influence public policy about computing.\n We want them to develop a framework for making these decisions in an informed\nway, given the constraints of a single one-quarter course and their non-technical\nbackgrounds.\n<BR>\nOne approach to courses like this is to cover programming and algorithms\nto some degree of mathematical formality.  Indeed, an Honors Collegium course\ncreated recently does take this approach, using the text by Goldschlager\nand Lister</FONT><A HREF=\"honors_seminar_sigcse_files/endnotes.html#_76\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>.\n We took the approach of de-emphasizing some of the more formal content--algorithm\ndesign and analysis, for example, and actual coding--because we felt there\nwas hardly enough time to do those topics justice and still cover the larger\nissues, especially given that few of the students had the mathematical sophistication\nnecessary to appreciate a formal treatment.  In the most recent offering\nwe used two texts, a general introduction by Biermann</FONT><A HREF=\"honors_seminar_sigcse_files/endnotes.html#_75\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>\nand a biographical supplement by Slater</FONT><A HREF=\"honors_seminar_sigcse_files/endnotes.html#_74\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>.\n We supplement these with various readings, such as the <I>Daedalus</I>\nissue on artificial intelligence (reprinted as </FONT><A HREF=\"honors_seminar_sigcse_files/endnotes.html#_73\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>)\nand the Parnas article on SDI</FONT><A HREF=\"honors_seminar_sigcse_files/endnotes.html#_72\">Endnotes</A><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2>.\n<BR>\nThe course met over a ten-week quarter once a week for three hours, during\nwhich discussion (and some lecture) was led by the instructor, usually accompanied\nby a graduate student TA.  We provided electronic mail and Internet news\naccess to the students and encouraged them to explore; beyond that, we required\nno hands-on computing.  The course was graded on class participation, a\nfield-study term project (described below), and on individual half-hour\noral final exams, whose purpose was to gauge how conversant the student\nwas with the issues more than to test for a specific set of factual knowledge.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2><B>Course outline:</B>  To give each student the\nbasic terminology and concepts of computing--hardware and software, algorithms\nand programs, processor and memory, levels and categories of programming\nlanguages--the students were required to view six 50-minute videotapes on\nthese topics, prior to the start of the class or by the end of the first\nweek.  This provided a common background on which the course itself could\nbuild.  The course followed this rough outline:\n<BR>\nWeek 1:  Computers and their context:  Survey of current major problems\nin computing and discussion of scenarios raising ethical issues.  Every\nstudent could feel comfortable stating an opinion on such issues, even without\ntechnical expertise.\n<BR>\nWeek 2:  Computer misuse and abuse:  Computer hacking, crime, and security.\n Review of technical questions raised by videotapes.\n<BR>\nWeek 3:  Hardware and software:  Storing numeric, textual, and pictorial\ninformation; characteristics and diversity of storage, input, and output\ndevices; interpreting technical specifications.  We use the campus computer\nstore&#39;s price lists, which include detailed system specifications, as\na guide through these issues.\n<BR>\nWeek 4:  Computer systems:  operating systems, computer networks and distributed\ncomputing, electronic mail and bulletin boards.\n<BR>\nWeek 5:  Limits of computation:  intractable and noncomputable problems,\ndealing with problems of software quality (formal verification vs. testing\nvs. software fault-tolerance through multiple design teams).\n<BR>\nWeek 6:  Limits of computation:  representing complex data (such as human\nexperience and knowledge), simulation of human thought processes, the potential\nand limits of artificial intelligence (including the Turing Test).\n<BR>\nWeek 7:  Computerization in the long range:  Reliance on and hiding behind\ncomputer-generated results, increasing reliance on automated processes and\nresulting changes in human skills, responsibility for malfunction of computer\nsystems.\n<BR>\nWeeks 8-10:  Students&#39; term project presentations.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2><B>Field study project:</B>  Most of the students&#39;\nwork in the course is devoted to a &quot;field study&quot; term project,\nfor which they are expected to apply computing to their own area of interest.\n The project was stated as broadly as possible, and students&#39; projects\nranged from the mundane acquisition of small-business computing systems\nthrough the use of graphics to model the results of plastic surgery and\nthe computerized scoring of fencing tournaments to the adoption and implementation\nof touch-tone telephone course enrollment for the campus.  We encouraged\nstudents to use the Internet news system as a source of information.\n<BR>\nThe project description received by the students appears in an appendix.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2><B>Evaluation:  </B>Many of the projects were\nastonishingly thorough and insightful; others consisted primarily of hand-waving,\nwhich occurred in cases where students did not fully appreciate the limits\nof their technical expertise.\n<BR>\nThe holistically-graded oral final exam was a great success, despite the\nstudents&#39; initial trepidation.  It afforded the instructor an opportunity\nto pursue in depth the areas the student knew most about and was most comfortable\nwith, and given the students&#39; high academic standing, embarrassing situations\nwhere the student was unable to make a decent showing were rare.\n<BR>\nStudents&#39; use of electronic mail and network news was less than completely\nsuccessful; the burden of learning the access protocols to an unfamiliar\ntimesharing system and the distance of the available terminals from their\ndaily ambit proved too great to overcome for most students, who used the\nsystem only infrequently.  Friendlier systems and more universal access\nwill remedy this.\n<BR>\nThe course was very well received and was offered even after the instructor\nhad moved his other teaching duties to a different campus of the university.\n The students appreciated the opportunity to explore these issues, particularly\nin the seminar environment, and they indicated that their eyes had been\nopened to the breadth of computer science.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=2><B>Acknowledgements:</B>  The author&#39;s teaching\nassistants contributed immeasurably to the development and success of this\ncourse:  Jody Paul, Scott R.
