First, they\nhave increased his control of his material environment.  They have\nimproved his food, his clothing, his shelter; they have increased his\nsecurity and released him partly from the bondage of bare existence.\nThey have given him increased knowledge of his own biological\nprocesses so that he has had a progressive freedom from disease and an\nincreased span of life.  They are illuminating the interactions of his\nphysiological and psychological functions, giving the promise of an\nimproved mental health.\n\n<p>\n\nScience has provided the swiftest communication between individuals;\nit has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate\nand to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and\nendures throughout the life of a race rather than that of an\nindividual.\n\n<p>\n\nThere is a growing mountain of research.  But there is increased\nevidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization\nextends.  The investigator is staggered by the findings and\nconclusions of thousands of other workers - conclusions which he\ncannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, as they appear.  Yet\nspecialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the\neffort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial.\n\n<p>\n\nProfessionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results\nof research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for\ntheir purpose.  If the aggregate time spent in writing scholarly works\nand in reading them could be evaluated, the ratio between these\namounts of time might well be startling.  Those who conscientiously\nattempt to keep abreast of current thought, even in restricted fields,\nby close and continuous reading might well shy away from an\nexamination calculated to show how much of the previous month's\nefforts could be produced on call.  Mendel's concept of the laws of\ngenetics was lost to the world for a generation because his\npublication did not reach the few who were capable of grasping and\nextending it; and this sort of catastrophe is undoubtedly being\nrepeated all about us, as truly significant attainments become lost in\nthe mass of the inconsequential.\n\n<p>\n\nThe difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish unduly in view\nof the extent and variety of present-day interests, but rather that\npublication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make\nreal use of the record.  The summation of human experience us being\nexpanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading\nthrough the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the\nsame as was used in the days of square-rigged ships.\n\n<p>\n\nBut there are signs of a change as new and powerful instrumentalities\ncome into use.  Photocells capable of seeing things in a physical\nsense, advanced photography which can record what is seen or even what\nis not, thermionic tubes capable of controlling potent forces under\nthe guidance of less power than a mosquito uses to vibrate his wings,\ncathode ray tubes rendering visible an occurrence so brief that by\ncomparison a microsecond is a long time, relay combinations which will\ncarry out involved sequences of movements more reliably than any human\noperator and thousand of times as fast - there are plenty of\nmechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific\nrecords.\n\n<p>\n\nTwo centuries ago Leibnitz invented a calculating machine which\nembodied most of the essential features of recent keyboard devices,\nbut it could not then come into use.  The economics of the situation\nwere against it: the labor involved in constructing it, before the\ndays of mass production, exceeded the labor to be saved by its use,\nsince all it could accomplish could be duplicated by sufficient use of\npencil and paper.  Moreover, it would have been subject to frequent\nbreakdown, so that it could not have been depended upon; for at that\ntime and long after, complexity and unreliability were synonymous.\n\n<p>\n\nBabbage, even with remarkably generous support for his time, could not\nproduce his great arithmetical machine.  His idea was sound enough,\nbut construction and maintenance costs were then too heavy.  Had a\nPharaoh been given detailed and explicit designs of an automobile, and\nhad he understood them completely, it would have taxed the resources\nof his kingdom to have fashioned the thousands of parts for a single\ncar, and that car would have broken down on the first trip to Giza.\n\n<p>\n\nMachines with interchangeable parts can now be constructed with great\neconomy of effort.  In spite of much complexity, they perform reliably.\nWitness the humble typewriter, or the movie camera, or the automobile.\nElectrical contacts have ceased to stick when thoroughly understood.\nNote the automatic telephone exchange, which has hundred of thousands\nof such contacts, and yet is reliable.  A spider web of metal, sealed\nin a thin glass container, a wire heated to brilliant glow, in short,\nthe thermionic tube of radio sets, is made by the hundred million,\ntossed about in packages, plugged into sockets - and it works!  Its\ngossamer parts, the precise location and alignment involved in its\nconstruction, would have occupied a master craftsman of the guild for\nmonths; now it is built for thirty cents.  The world has arrived at an\nage of cheap complex devices of great reliability; and something is\nbound to come of it.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Next:</b> <a href=\"section2.html\">Section 2</a>,\n<b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"intro.html\">Introduction</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
