Your top-level entity should be similar to the following:\n\nentity PRIME is\n  port(clck     : in  STD_LOGIC;\n       rst      : in  STD_LOGIC;\n       N        : in  UNSIGNED(7 downto 0);\n       is_prime : out STD_LOGIC;\n       done     : out STD_LOGIC);\nend PRIME;\n\nOf course, your PRIME entity should in turn be decomposed into a controller\nentity and a datapath entity. You may assume that the input N will not change\nduring the computation.\n\nYou need to also design a testbench and verify your design. There is no\nrequirement for your testbench to be exhaustive. However, for your demo, the\nTA may provide any value for N and you have to be able to demonstrate the\noperation of your div/mod entity.\n\nComplete a report and attach to it all source VHDL files. Your report should\ninclude your name, a description of the VHDL files attached, any special\nnotes or comments, and a description of how you tested your design. Also, your\nreport should contain the datapath drawing and controller FSM.\n\nYour TA will provide you with information on tools, lab setup, and other things\nrelated to this project. Make sure you seek help to get you started.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
