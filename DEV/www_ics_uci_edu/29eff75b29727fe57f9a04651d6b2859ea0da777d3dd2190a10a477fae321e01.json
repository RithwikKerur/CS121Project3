We will be interested in\ncapturing the values of the user time usage only.\n<P>\n<B>A problem</B>:&nbsp;\nOn some systems, the timing function gives times in multiples\nof .01 seconds.&nbsp;\nOn others, the timing coarseness may be\nsignificantly smaller or larger.&nbsp;\n(You should determine the timing coarseness for your machine.)&nbsp;\nThus, for example, on a system with .01 second timing coarseness,\ntiming anything which takes less than\none fiftieth of a second could result in more than a 50% error.&nbsp;\nYour programs, for small values of <I>n</I>,\nshould be easily this fast.\n<P>\n<B>A solution</B>:&nbsp;\nWhen the algorithm to be timed is too fast to obtain an accurate\nmeasurement, the algorithm can be run many times in succession,\nwith the cumulative time being measured.&nbsp;\nThis time can then be divided by the number of runs to obtain a more\naccurate measurement of the time required by an individual run.&nbsp;\n<I>As little as possible</I>, other then the successive calls,\nshould occur while the timing is taking place.&nbsp;\n<!--\nIn fact, for particularly speedy code, the time spent updating\nthe loop variable may be of the same order of magnitude as\nthe time you are attempting to measure.&nbsp;\nTo account for this, you can subsequently time the loop with\na (nearly) empty body and subtract this measure from your first measure,\nthe net result reflecting more accurately the time spent within\nthe code of interest.\nOne should note that some optimizing compilers will\noptimize loops that contain an empty body by discarding them.\n-->\n\n<H3> Timer package </H3>\n\nProgram file <a href=\"timer.c\"><tt>timer.c</tt></a> should be compiled\nand linked with your program system.&nbsp;\nIt defines the following routines:\n<UL>\n<LI> <tt>user_time()</tt>\n  <BR>\nreturns the total amount of user cpu time used by the current process\n  <BR>\n<LI> <tt>start_timer()</tt>\n  <BR>\nstarts the timer\n[actually, it only records the current value of <tt>user_time()</tt>]\n  <BR>\n<LI> <tt>elapsed_time()</tt>\n  <BR>\nreturns the amount of cpu time that has been used since the last call\nto <tt>start_timer()</tt>\n</UL>\n<P>\nHeader file <a href=\"timer.h\"><tt>timer.h</tt></a>\ndeclares the routines that are defined in <tt>timer.c</tt>\nand it should be <tt>include</tt>d in all program files\nthat invoke any of those routines.\n\n<P>\nNote that the MinGW system does not have the proper version of <tt>include</tt> timing files.\nIf you were to try to compile the <tt>timer.c</tt> program file in MinGW,\nyou would get compilation errors.\nAccordingly, for your own personal use (not to be used for course submissions),\nyou may make use of file <a href=\"timerMinGW.c\"><tt>timerMinGW.c</tt></a> instead,\nwhich I believe should work on the MinGW system.\n\n</span>\n<HR>\n\n<small>Last modified: Mar  4, 2018</small>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
