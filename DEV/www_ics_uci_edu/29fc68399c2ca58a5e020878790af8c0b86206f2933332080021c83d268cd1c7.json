class- we will spend some time in class looking\r\n  at and solving these problems.\r\nThey mostly concern the precise use of a natural language: there are many\r\n  parallels to the precise use of a

<b>Background</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI expect students entering ICS-46 to have a good knowledge of programming in\r\n  general and programming in C++ in particular.\r\nI expect that they have used some kind of Integrated Development Environment\r\n  (IDE) to write, run, and debug code.\r\nMost students enrolling in this course are sophomores (or transfer students),\r\n  who have taken a year of programming in Java or Python and a quarter of\r\n  programming in C++ either in ICS-45C (or ICS-65 or equivalent) here at UCI or\r\n  at a Community College.\r\n<p>\r\nC++ is a large programming language and I am not sure what features you were\r\n  taught and more importantly what features you have mastered.\r\nThis quarter, you will likely use most of the C++ features that you have\r\n  learned and more.\r\nIf I use a language feature that you are not familiar with, please bring it to\r\n  my attention so that we can discuss it (whether in class, or even better in\r\n  a Piazza Message Folder; see more about the Message Folders below).\r\n<p>\r\nThe first two programming assignments are foundational; the next four cover\r\n  new material that we will learn this quarter.\r\nProgramming Assignment #0 will quickly bring you up to speed on using\r\n  Eclipse/C++, the course library (containing a similar but simplified version\r\n  of the Standard Template Library: called the ICS-46 Template Library: ITL),\r\n  and the GoogleTest library for unit testing code.\r\nProgramming Assignment #1 will explore how to use the ITL to solve a variety of\r\n  complicated programs elegantly.\r\n<p>\r\nProgramming Assignments #2-#5 augment the ITL with more efficient\r\n  implementations of the templated classes, and extensions to the templated\r\n  classes, based on the data structure material that we will cover this quarter.\r\nCentral to all these assignments will be the use and implementation of\r\n  iterators.\r\nDuring most of these assignments you will use the GoogleTest library to run\r\n  unit tests on your code to help you test and debug it.\r\nGrading will be based on GoogleTests and any other program requirements that we\r\n  will check visually.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- New Material  -->\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"NewMaterial\"></a><b>New Material</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nWe will study three major topics, each of which is multifaceted: students\r\n  should also acquire fluency in thinking about,discussing, and writing\r\n  programs in C++ using appropriate features.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li> Demonstrate skill solving problems/programming with the ITL classes:\r\n       specifically, understand the operations that we can perform\r\n       on the (abstract) data types <i>Stack</i>, <i>Queue</i>,\r\n       <i>PriorityQueue</i>, <i>Set</i>, <i>Map</i>, <i>EquivalenceClass</i>\r\n       and <i>Graph</i> (including using their iterators);\r\n       and use combinations of these data types and their operations to solve\r\n       complicated problems.\r\n<p>\r\n     We call these software components data TYPES or ABSTRACT data TYPES\r\n       because they are characterized completely by their external behavior.\r\n     E.g., in queues we know that if C++ executes <b>q.enqueue(\"a\");</b>\r\n       followed by <b>q.enqueue(\"b\");</b> and <b>q.enqueue(\"c\");</b> then\r\n       calling <b>q.dequeue()</b> will returrn <b>\"a\"</b> and leave only\r\n       <b>\"b\"</b> (first) and <b>\"c\"</b> (second, and last) in the queue, no\r\n       matter how such a queue is actually implemented in C++: e.g., by an\r\n       array or linked list.\r\n<p>\r\n     Likewise, in stacks we know that if C++ executes <b>s.push(\"a\");</b>\r\n       followed by <b>s.push(\"b\");</b> and <b>s.push(\"c\");</b> then calling\r\n       <b>s.pop()</b> will returrn <b>\"c\"</b> and leave only <b>\"b\"</b>\r\n      (at the top) and <b>\"a\"</b> (at the bottom) in the stack,\r\n       no  matter how such a stack is actually implemented in C++.\r\n<p>\r\n     So data types have external behavior that must be captured/exhibited by\r\n       any data structure used to implement a data type.\r\n     For templated classes, we use the declaration part of <b>.hpp</b> files to\r\n       define all the C++ methods and operations available for a data type.\r\n<p>\r\n<li> Demonstrate skill using low-level C++ data structures (primarily\r\n       arrays and self-referential data structures: e.g., lists, trees, and\r\n       hash tables) to implement these data types correctly (how the\r\n       information is represented and what algorithms process the information)\r\n       and ensure that they run efficiently. \r\n<p>\r\n     There are many different data STRUCTURES that we can use to implement\r\n       every data TYPE.\r\n     E.g., there are various implementations of queues that use arrays and\r\n       linked-list data structures that correctly reproduce queue behavior.\r\n     Each has different advantages and disadvantages over the other \r\n     (see 3 below for an important category of differences). \r\n<p>\r\n     I will provide slow implementations for all these data types, which use \r\n       simple array data structures to implement their behavior.\r\n     Using these simple implementations, we can write programs (using these\r\n       data types) that execute correctly, if slowly.\r\n     During the quarter we will discuss more interesting data structures and\r\n       use them to reimplement these data types more efficiently.\r\n     By substituting a faster implementation for a data type (using just a few\r\n       edits in our code), our programs will produce the same results (exhibit\r\n       the same external behavior) but run more quickly.\r\n<p>\r\n     For templated classes, we use the definition  part of <b>.hpp</b> files to\r\n       define concrete classes in C++ to specify how the operations on a data\r\n       type are implemented using the data structure implementing it.\r\n     They also define a nested class definition for iterators.\r\n<p>\r\n<li> Understand O -big oh (and &Omega; -big omega- and &Theta; -big Theta)\r\n       notation, and demonstrate the ability to use these notations to analyze\r\n       the efficiency of implementations of templated classes, and understand\r\n       the appropriate usefulness and limits of these notations (and contrast\r\n       and augment them by collecting empirical data). \r\n<p>\r\n     Since all data structures that implement a data type exhibit the same\r\n     external behavior, their primary difference is how fast their operations\r\n     run (and to a lesser extent, how much memory they occupy). We will use\r\n     mathematical and empirical approaches to study the efficency of the\r\n     algorithms that run on various data structures.\r\n</ol>\r\nIn pursuit of goals 1-2, we will gain experience using\r\n  intermediate-level C++ programming ideas: template classes, recursion,\r\n  hashing, caching, the decorator pattern, etc. \r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Expectations  -->\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"Expectations\"></a><b>Expectations for Learning</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nAs members of a course, working together in teaching and learning, we should\r\n  share the following expectations.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Instructor:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Starts and stops class on time.\r\n  <li>Assigns the minimal amount of homework, but enough so that students learn\r\n        all the required material\r\n        <ul>ICS-46 is a 4 unit course; typically each unit requires 3 hours\r\n              of work each week..\r\n            This means your time working on ICS-46 should occupy about 12\r\n              hours every week.\r\n            Of this 12 hours, about 3 hours will be in-class lecture;\r\n              so the other 9 will correspond to reading course material,\r\n              working on quizzes, and working on programming assignments\r\n              in and outside of lab.\r\n            A full-time student typically takes ~12-16 units/quarter, which\r\n              translates into 36-48 hours of work each week.\r\n        </ul>\r\n  <li>Distributes course materials in a timely manner.\r\n  <li>Returns solutions/graded homework promptly.\r\n  <li>Is available for providing individual help.\r\n</ul>\r\n<b>Student:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Attends class, is punctual, and participates.\r\n  <li>Completes all homework, spending the requisite time to learn all the\r\n         required material.\r\n  <li>Studies course materials (READ!

follow these rules.\r\n</ul>\r\nThe most useful online mechanism for handing questions/discussions is Piazza's\r\n  <a href=\"https://piazza.com/class/jjpy91cugd45bs\" target=\"main\">\r\n    Message Folders</a> (easily reachable from the course web's index).\r\nThese Folders allow students to ask questions (or start discussions) easily, as\r\n  well as supply answers (or participate in the discsussion further).\r\nInitially, I have created six categories of  Message Folders for ICS-33:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Programming Assignments\r\n<li>Quizzes\r\n<li>Exams (In-Lab, Midterm, Final)\r\n<li>C++ and Clion\r\n<li>Lecture Material\r\n<li>Finding Programming Partners\r\n</ol>\r\nIf the need arises for other Folders (tell me if you think another would be\r\n  useful), I will create them.\r\nYou can instruct Piazza to email you links to any active discussions in the\r\n  Folders.\r\nIn past quarters, these Folders have seen a tremendous amount of traffic: course\r\n  material has been clarified, questions have been asked and answered, and many\r\n  interesting side-discussions have ensued.\r\nBut the efficacy depends on your participation.\r\n<p>\r\nI will broadcast information to all the students (and staff) in ICS-46\r\n  using the <a href=\"mailto:ics46a-F19@classes.uci.edu\">ICS-46 Email List</a>\r\n  (ics46a-F19@classes.uci.edu).\r\nAll students and staff in the course will automatically receive emails sent to\r\n  this address and all messages sent via this discussion list will be archived\r\n  on the\r\n    <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/f19/35540/\" target=\"main\">\r\n    Email Archive</a> (easily reachable from the course web's index).\r\nMost student-initiated questions/discussions should use the Piazza Message\r\n  Folders mentioned above, but sometimes students can use this email list to\r\n  inform the instructor, staff, and other students about some timely issue:\r\n  e.g., Checkmate not responding to program submissions.\r\n<p>\r\nLearning when and how to seek help from others is an important skill to acquire\r\n  -one that you will use continually in your professional career.\r\nFor example, if you encounter a programming problem that you cannot solve in 5\r\n  minutes (and see no further steps toward a solution), you should be able to\r\n  explain the problem concisely (using all the programming terminology that you\r\n  have learned) to someone else, and then understand and apply an informed\r\n  answer, possibly collaborating to reach a solution.\r\n<p>\r\nInstructors, TAs, and Lab Tutors all have experience handling such questions,\r\n  and are trained to help students learn to become more self-sufficient\r\n  -while still answering their questions: for example, we might tell you a\r\n  general technique for solving a collection of similar problems instead of \r\n just telling you \"the answer\".\r\nSometimes this process is a bit frustrating for students seeking help\r\n  (especially if they started the assignment late and are caught in a\r\n  time-bind), but ultimately this approach makes them better programmers.\r\nThe appropriate homily is, <i>\"Give a person a fish and you feed them for a\r\n  day; teach a person to fish and you feed them for life.\"</i>\r\n<p>\r\nThink seriously about using the human resources that UCI provides (which\r\n  includes me, our TAs,<!--Grader,--> and Lab Tutors, and your fellow\r\n  students), just as you would think about using computational resources:\r\n  the former resources are even more important than the latter.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Knowing when (and how) to seek help is a strength, not a weakness.</b>\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- A Bit about Me-->\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"Me\"></a><b>A Bit about Me<b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI hope to get to know you all individually during the quarter.\r\nHere is some information about me.\r\n<p>\r\nI grew up on the North Shore of Chicago (in the town of Wilmette) and attended\r\n   New Trier West High School.\r\nI was an undergraduate Mathematics major at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)\r\n  from 1972-1975, after which I taught a introductory programming there for a\r\n  year.\r\nI went to graduate school in Computer Science at Stanford.\r\nWhile there, I wrote a book, <i>Karel the Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the\r\n  Art of Programming</i>, and its associated software (since updated by Mark\r\n  Stehlik and Jim Roberts at CMU).\r\nOver the years, my book has been revised and extended by Joe Bergin to C++,\r\n  C++, and now Python, and it is still used in Colleges and High Schools\r\n  around the world.\r\n<p>\r\nFrom 1985-1995 I taught introductory and intermediate programming at the\r\n  University of Washington in Seattle (sending lots of my students to work\r\n  at Microsoft; the times allowed many of them to become millionaires).\r\nFrom 1996-2007 I returned to teach at CMU; for the last two years there,\r\n  I served as the Freshman Advisor for incomming Freshman in Computer\r\n  Science (about 150/year)\r\nIn 2007, I joined the Bren School of Information and Computer Science (with\r\n  a joint appointment in Computer Science and Informatics), returning to teach\r\n  in a public university (where my wife was the founding director of the\r\n  Nursing program; she now works at USC).\r\n<p>\r\nDuring my Freshman year in high school, I had a Math teacher named Mr. Lill.\r\nOne class, during a test, my mechanical pencil broke.\r\nI asked Mr. Lill to borrow one of his pencils; but he said no.\r\nI asked him whether I could borrow a friend's pencil; but he said no to that\r\n  too.\r\nHe told me to always come prepared to class, and sat me back down at my desk\r\n  (where I failed the test because I was unable to write any answers).\r\nI had a very low opinion of Mr. Lill for a long time -for years, and I thought\r\n  about this incident for many years; but he taught me an important lesson that\r\n  stayed with me much longer than the mathematics he taught.\r\nI hope I don't have to be anyone's \"Mr. Lill\", but I will assume that role if\r\n  necessary: there are lots of lessons to be taught at UCI and not all of them\r\n  concern the content of the course material.\r\n<p>\r\nI have posted this story on my course web pages for many many years.\r\nAmazingly, in 2009, when I was attending a reception for students\r\n  admitted to ICS at UCI, I started talking with a student and his parents.\r\nOffhandedly I asked where the father grew up; it was near me; I asked what\r\n  high school he went to; it was mine; I asked what year he started; it was\r\n  the same year that I started!\r\nAt that point we exchanged names, and recognized each other: we were not\r\n  close friends in High School and had not seen each other since graduation.\r\nThe absolute first comment he made to me was, \"Do you remember the day in Mr.\r\n  Lill's class when he wouldn't let you borrow the pencil.\"\r\nI was totally floored.\r\nObviously the lesson that I learned so painfully that day was also learned by\r\n  many others, but at a lesser cost.\r\n<p>\r\nAs a senior in High School I wanted to take both AP Chemistry and AP Physics,\r\n  but they were scheduled at the same time.\r\nI had great respect for and enjoyed being in the classroom with the Chemistry\r\n  teacher, Mr. Koonz, so I signed up for AP Chemistry.\r\nI asked the AP Physics teacher for a list of all the problems that he assigned\r\n  from the textbook, and spent the year reading the book and working those\r\n  problems (the book had answers -but not worked solutions, so I could see if\r\n  I was right, but not know why not if I was wrong- for many of those problems\r\n  in the back).\r\nThe result was that I discovered that I could learn by myself, from what are now\r\n  considered very rudimentary learning materials (compared to the internet).\r\nA big goal of college is to teach students to be able to learn by themselves.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"FCE\"></a><b>Student Feedback</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThe most interesting short comment that I received on a Faculty/Course\r\n  Evaluation form (FCE) was, \"You teach  a biased class.\"\r\nAfter some reflection, I had to agree with that student 100%.\r\nAlmost everything I do in my class is highly biased: choosing which programming\r\n  topics to teach, how to sequence these topics (which ones to emphasize, which\r\n  ones to relegate to mere details), deciding programming assignments and test\r\n  questions (and how to award (partial) credit for these problems and\r\n  questions), etc.\r\nYou are sitting in my classroom because you have decided to obtain the UCI\r\n  bias on how to learn programming.\r\n<p>\r\nI once read a book written about MIT.\r\nThe author observed that everyone there majored in the same thing: MIT.\r\nYes, they all learned a different vocabulary and facts, and practiced reasoning\r\n   and problem solving in different disciplines, but what everyone really was\r\n   doing there was learning to think like an MIT graduate.\r\nAlong these lines, I want you to eventually acquire a Pattis simulator in\r\n  your head.\r\nBy running it, you can determine how I would approach a problem; how I would\r\n  critique a solution, etc.\r\nYou don't have to agree with the results it produces, but it is there for\r\n  you to consult.\r\n<p>\r\nThe most interesting long comment I received on a course evaluation form was\r\nlabeled <b>A Relevant Allegory</b>:\r\n<p>\r\n<i>\r\n  \"In order to teach someone to boil water, he would first spend a day giving\r\n     the history of pots, including size, shape, and what metals work best.\r\n   The next day he'd lecture on the chemical properties of water.\r\n   On day three, he'd talk about boiled water through the ages.\r\n   That night, he'd tell people to go home and use boiled water to make\r\n     spaghetti carbonera.\r\n   But never once would he tell you to put the water in the pot and heat it.\r\n   That's what his programming classes are like -completely irrelevant to the\r\n     task at hand.\"\r\n</i>\r\n<p>   \r\nI like this comment because it is witty, well-written, and true -although\r\n  maybe not in the extreme that the author states.\r\nTeaching students to boil water is great for a high school class, but\r\n  in college we are trying to achieve something deeper: we might, instead,\r\n  study phase transitions in matter.\r\nThat is, we don't just learn particulars (drill and practice); we learn\r\n  general theories and -in spite of what this student says- how to apply\r\n  them to particular cases.\r\nI want to teach programming in such a way that when students are exposed to\r\n  new and novel situations, they will be able to use their general knowledge\r\n  to fall back and analyze the problem, figure out what they know and what\r\n  they need to learn to solve the problem, and ultimately synthesize a\r\n  solution.\r\nI acknowledge that learning from first principles is tougher than just\r\n  memorization, and that sometimes students feel that the material covered is\r\n  not \"applied\".\r\nBut, I believe that everything that I teach has many concrete applications.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"LearningProgramming\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<h3>Learning a Programming Language</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Learning Programming  -->\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a name=\"Learning\"></a><b>Learning</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nIn this section I'd like to work from the general to the specific,\r\n  from education to programming, illustrated with various\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pattis/quotations.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n    Quotes</a>\r\n  I have collected on my web page.\r\nLet's start with three interesting quotes: the first from a graduate student\r\n  at the University of Washington, and the second from Jacob Bronowski, a\r\n  distinguished philosopher of science, the third from Edward Teller, a\r\n  physicist.\r\n<p>\r\n<table width =\"100%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" rules=all\">\r\n<tr><td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\">\r\nThere is a division in the student population between those who go to college\r\n  to learn and those who go to college to earn a diploma. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>- J.
