In the stable marriage problem with three men and three women,\n   suppose that all the men have the same preferences as each other, and\n   all the women have the same preferences as each other. How many\n   different possible solutions to the stable marriage problem will\n   there be in this case?\n\n2. Suppose that G is a complete binary tree with four levels and fifteen\n   nodes (one root node, two children, four grand-children, and eight\n   great-grand-children).\n(a) Is G a bipartite graph?\n(b) Draw G and show in your drawing a maximum matching (a matching that\n    uses as many edges as possible) in G.\n\n3. Let H be a graph with six vertices connected into a cycle (a hexagon).\n(a) Is H a bipartite graph?\n(b) Draw H and show in your drawing a matching that is maximal (cannot\n    have any edges added to it) but that is not maximum.\n(c) Show an augmenting path for your matching.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
