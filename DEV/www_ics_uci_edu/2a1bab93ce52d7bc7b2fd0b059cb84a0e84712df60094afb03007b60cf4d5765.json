What actually happens is that the part of the rectangle \n&gt; that's not covered by the four pieces forms a very acute (and nearly\n&gt; undetectable) parallelogram of area 1.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I'd like to know is, can anyone think of a good way to dissect\n&gt; a 5-by-5-by-5 cube and a 6-by-6-by-6 cube into pieces that, when\n&gt; rearranged, seem to form a 7-by-7-by-7 cube, thereby \"disproving\"\n&gt; Fermat's Last Theorem?  (5^3 + 6^3 = 341, while 7^3 = 343: that's\n&gt; pretty close!)\n\nI'm sorry not to suggest an answer, but the task reminds me of what is \ncalled the Barnach-Tarski Paradox. Using the process of decomposition \ninto finite sets it is possible to divide the set of points on the \nsurface of a sphere into partitions which can be rearranged into two \nspheres both of which have the same surface area as the original sphere.\nNeedless to say, the nature of the partitioning is such that you \ncouldn't actually cut the sphere and physically rearranging it.\n\nThis is not a trick, but a proven result! The original paper includes \na 16 page proof (in French), but I've lost the reference (Sorry). \nThere is a more recent book devoted to the paradox and its \nimplications but I don't have a reference to it either. Perhaps if one\nfound the original paper, one could partition it and rearrange it to \nform the book :^)\n\nMatt.\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
