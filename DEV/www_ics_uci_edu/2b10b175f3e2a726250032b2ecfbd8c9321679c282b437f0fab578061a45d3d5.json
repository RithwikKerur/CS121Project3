You\nwill also learn a bit about object oriented design and a fair amount about\nobject oriented programming, using Java as the &#147;language of practice.&#148 You also gain experience in working with a partner; working in a team is a common industry practice that, when properly done, produces better programs &#151; and faster than when a person works alone!\n</p>\n<p>This course is also known as CSE 21; that&#146;s its designation for the CSE major. For simplicity, we&#146;ll refer to this class as ICS 21, though it is indeed both ICS 21 and CSE 21. CSE 21 uses different course codes than ICS 21 (and there are two sets of course codes for CSE 21, one for CSE majors within the Samueli School of Engineering and another set for those CSE majors in the Bren School of ICS). You can find these codes at the  <a href=\"http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/perl/WebSoc?YearTerm=2011-92&ShowFinals=1&ShowComments=1&Division=0xx&InstrName=JACOBSON\">ICS 21/CSE21 WebSoc page.</a></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"CourseStructure\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Overview of course structure</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>ICS 21 consists of a lecture, lab exams sections and the ICS 21 Help Center. \n\n<p>Lecture is where we impart course material and where you take the midterm\nand final exams. If you miss lecture, we suggest that you arrange with your classmates to \nborrow their notes: the instructor and TAs will not repeat lecture material you missed, \nthough of course they will answer questions about it.</p>\n\n<p>The ICS 21 Help Center is a computer lab, with TAs and tutors on duty, where you can&#151;and should&#151;work on lab assignments and get help with them and other course material. TAs can answer questions on any aspect of the course, including Java programming, lecture material and grading issues. Tutors can (only) help you with your Java and programming questions. This quarter, the Help Center gets to use two rooms during the afternoon and evening hours, an often particularly busy time (see Important Information, below, for details).\n\n<p>When working on lab assignments, we have you use the &#147;pair programming&#148; approach. In pair programming, two programmers share one computer. One is the &#147;driver,&#148; who controls the keyboard and mouse. The other is the &#147;navigator,&#148; who observes, asks questions, suggests solutions, and thinks about slightly longer-term strategies. The two programmers switch roles about every 20 minutes. A pair of programmers, working as described here, nearly always beats the stereotypical solitary loner, producing more high-quality code in less than half the time (surprising, perhaps, but true). You will work with one partner for the first three labs, and another for the last two labs. Working in pairs should prepare you much more thoroughly for the lab exams than working alone.</p>\n\n<p>The assignments prepare you for the lab exams, five computer-based exams to test your knowledge of programming. You take these tests on lab exam days in the Help Center. </p>\n\n<p>More about the lab assignments, lab exams, the Help Center and pair programming are discussed in the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/00-LabManual.html\">Lab Manual</a>.\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<a name =\"Enrolling\"></a>\n<h3>Enrolling in ICS 21</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>To be enrolled in ICS 21, you must be enrolled in lecture and one (and only one) of its lab sections; the (first hour) of your lab section is when you have a guaranteed seat to take your lab exams.</p>\n\n<p>Procedures for dropping the class, changing your lab section, petitioning to add the class, changing your grade \noption and related matters are discussed in <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/EnrollmentInformation.html\">\nEnrollment Information</a>.\n\n<hr>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Information\"></a>\n<h3>Important information</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Please keep this information at hand;

This book discusses introductory programming and the basics of Java, the programming language we will be using to practice programming concepts. It is available in two forms: 1) as a paperback book, loose leaf or bound, and with or without an access code to the electronic version of the text, available from various bookstores and Websites, 2) as an &#147;electronic book&#148; from the publisher, Wiley Press, accessible via the Web, and 3) as an download file; you copy the text to your hard drive and read it using special software.</p>\n\n<p>The Web-based version of the text has sections that the printed copy does not, in particular, a number of &#147;special topics,&#148; some of which we cover in this course. (And it has a number of additional chapters. The on-line text is actually a copy of the text <i>Big Java</i>, a book that has all that is in <i>Java Concepts</i> and then some. We do not cover the chapters that are in <i>Big Java</i> but not in <i>Java Concepts</i>.) I strongly urge you to obtain access to the electronic copy of the text (whether or not you obtain a hard-copy version) so that you can read the special topics. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><h4>Option1: Getting a print version of the text</h4>\n\n<p>The bookstore has a new print copies of the book, loose leaf, with the code for $94.60, and used copies (which may not have a still-valid code) for $70.95, both plus tax. For comparison,  Amazon.com is selling the text, bound, for $89.33 (with free shipping) and Wiley's main site is selling it for $123.95, plus tax and shipping; you can also rent it from Barnes &amp; Noble for $56.14 for 90 days, or buy it outright for $89.33 (with free shipping).</p>\n\n<p>The best deal I have found for a new book (loose leaf) is being offered by Wiley through a UCI-specific web site; from the page <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-406856.html\">//www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-406856.html</a> you can purchase the book with an access code for $83.95 plus shipping (from $6.00 to $25.00, depending upon how fast you want the book) and tax.</p>\n\n<p> A new printed text with an access code costs more than the on-line text alone, but you get both a printed book and access to the online version of the text. If you buy a used print copy of the book, from any source, it does not matter whether you buy a version with the online access code: the code, even if present, will likely be invalid.</p>\n\n<li><h4>Option 2: Getting access to the electronic version of the text</h4>\n\n<p>To get access to the electronic version of the text, go to <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-404743.html#computerscience\">the Computer Science section of the WileyPlus Courses website</a> and click on <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Horstmann / Big Java Fourth Edition AND Java Concepts Sixth Edition, WileyPLUS Registration Code</font>.

You may also find the tools within Microsoft Office useful. All these packages (and others) are available for your use on the machines in the ICS labs. If you want to obtain any of this software for use on your own machine, please ask the instructor for details. In brief, Office and SecureCRT must be licensed (for a fee), and Eclipse, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Sun&#146;s Java are free.</p>\n\n<p>You will also need a way to back up (make a copy) of your work.  You can use a USB memory stick or portable external hard drive, available in several capacities from many sources, including the UCI Computer store. You can also use diskettes, though they are getting harder to find and not all of our computers accept them. And you can store files to the so-called &#147;H drive&#148; of your ICS account; details of using the H drive are in the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/02-OrientationToLab.html\">Orientation to the Lab</a> \nsection of the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/00-LabManual.html\">ICS 21 Lab Manual</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Grades\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Course assignments, exams, and their grading</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p><i>Lab assignments: </i>The \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/00-LabManual.html\">\nLab Manual</a> contains them (0% of the course grade!)</p>\n\n<p>The lab assignments have you design, implement (in Java) and test computer programs. Perhaps surprisingly, they are not graded&#151;but you are well advised to do them, as each prepares you for a corresponding lab exam.</p>\n\n<p>You will work on the lab assignments uising the pair programming approach discussed above. Pair programming almost always enables you to learn more about programming, and to complete the labs much more quickly, than working alone. You will work with one partner for the first three assignments, and a different partner for the last two. For each of these two pairings, we expect students to choose their partners. One good way to find a partner is to go to the Help Center and ask around;  another is to post a note on the course&#146;s <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/messageboard/m11641/f31850/\">Finding a Pair Programming Partner message board</a> on eee. If you prefer not to choose your own partner, or cannot find a partner, let a TA know; she or he will assist you in finding a partner. You or your partner must email the names of your team members to <font class=\"codeFaceSmall\">21-questions@ics.uci.edu</font> no later than the dates given in the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/CourseSchedule.html\">Course Schedule</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Details about pair programming and choosing a partner are in the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/02A-PairProgramming.html\">\nPair Programming</a> section of the Lab Manual.</p>\n\n<p>Programming assignments always take longer to complete than you think they will. (This phenomenon occurs among professional computer scientists, not just students of computing.) If you start each assignment no later than suggested, spend significant time in the Help Center completing assignments with your partner&#151;working diligently and asking questions while there&#151;and spend time as needed outside the Help Center's hours with your partner thinking through and working on your assignments, you will be ready to take the lab exams. Students who do not follow this advice typically have a much harder time passing the lab exams.</p>\n\n<p><i>Lab exams:</i> Five tests you take in the lab exam section to demonstrate programming competence (a minimum performance requirement)</p>\n\n<p>You take each of the lab exams at the Help Center, on the days indicated in the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/CourseSchedule.html\">Course Schedule</a>. \n\n<p>Each lab exam is scored as &#147;not taken,&#148; &#147;not passing&#148; or &#147;passing&#148;.</p>\n\n<p><i>You must pass every lab exam to obtain a grade of C or better in the course</i>. If you fail to pass a lab exam, you can take that test again (and again and again and...) at a scheduled  &#147;retake session,&#148; until you pass it, up through the last one offered, which will be during Finals Week. The place and times when retake sessions will be offered will be posted on the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/ICS21.html\">ICS 21 Web page</a> by the time the first lab exam is given.</p>\n\n<p>Much more detail about the lab exams and their grading is in the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/LabManual/00-LabManual.html\">Lab Manual</a>.</p>\n\n<p><i>One midterm:</i> (40 points, 40% of the base course grade)</p>\n\n<p><i>One final exam:</i> (60 points, 60% of the base course grade)</p>\n\n<p>To help you study for the miderm and final, we have a sample exam for each; links to them are on the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/ICS21.html\">ICS 21 Web page</a>. TAs and the instructor will happily discuss the questions (and their answers) with you after you have come up with your own answers. Most, but perhaps not all, of the topics covered by the questions in a sample exam will appear in the respective actual exam.</p>\n\n<p>You will need to bring to the midterm and final exams a Scantron answer sheet, Form No. 882-E or 2052 or equivalent (that is, a mark-sense form that is one-half of a regular sheet of paper cut lengthwise that has 50 questions on the front, with five possible responses \nfor each question). Form 882-E is available at the UCI bookstore and the Engineering Copy Center, among other locales.</p>\n\n<p>I keep your midterm and  final exam answer sheets, so that you can review them for any errors you think may be present, for about a year after the course is over, and typically recycle them after that time.</p>\n\n<p>During the quarter, your scores will be posted on UCI's \n<a href=\"http://eee.uci.edu\">Electronic Educational Environment (eee)</a> web site. \n(If you have not previously used eee to look up scores, it&#146;s quite straightforward. Just go to eee, sign in to MyEEE, and follow the instructions for viewing course grades.) </p>\n\n<p>If you think a lab exam was scored incorrectly, contact the staff member who grades your work; email often works best: Who grades your work, and that person's email address, is given in the &#147;Important information&#148; section, above.)  We&#146;ll look into the matter and fix any error we find. If that does not resolve the issue, see the instructor. If you have a question about the grading of your midterm or final, contact the instructor directly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"CourseGrade\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Course grade calculation</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Determining the final course grades requires several steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><i>We  determine your weighted point total for the midterm and final exams</i>. </p>\n\n<li><p><i>We add in your pair programming evaluation scores</i>. For each of the two evaluations of your programming partner (see the Lab Manual for details), we add 0, 1 or 2 points to your total points.  You earn 1 point for a cursory evaluation, 2 for an evaluation that is particularly thoughful or insightful, or 0 points\n if you turn it in late or not at all. So you can earn from 0 to 4 additional points, which are added to your point total, thus perhaps raising your provisional course grade.</p>\n\n<li><p><i>We deduct any pair programming adjustments</i>.  You may lose up to 4 points from your total (up to 2 points for each of the two pairs of which you are a part) if you did not fully participate in pair programming as described in course documents and the relevant documents they reference. If there is not an adjustment, that is a good thing&#151;it means that we were notified, on time,  of your partnerships, that you worked in a pair (or otherwise, with the needed permission) and we have no evidence that you were a bad partner. (In the posted scores on eee, the appearance of \"--\" means there was no adjustment.) </p>\n\n<li><p><i>We assign provisional course grades</i> using the following scale, <i>though the cutoffs may be, \nand often have been, lower</i>: Grades in the A range (A&#150;, A, A+), 80% and above; grades in the B range, 70%&#150;79%; grades in the C range, 60%&#150;69%; grades in the D range, 50%&#150;59%; and F grades below that.  A+ grades are reserved for the top scoring student or two, and are awarded only if those scores are significantly higher than the next highest scores.</p>\n\n<p><i>This is not a curve.</i> If it were, the cut points would be based on the distribution of scores in the class, rather than fixed cut points. Using an established point scale means that you are not graded in direct competition with your classmates.</p>\n\n<li><p><i>We determine how many exams you passed</i>:</p>\n\n<center>\n<table border width=\"175\" >\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\"><font class = \"normalSmall\">If you passed this # of exams</font></td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\"><font class = \"normalSmall\">Your course letter \ngrade is the <i>lower</i> of the provisional letter grade and a grade of</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\">\n<center>5</center></td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\">\nA+\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\">\n<center>4</center>\n</td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\">\nC-\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\">\n<center>3</center>\n</td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\">\nD+\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\">\n<center>2</center>\n</td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\">\nD\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\">\n<center>1</center>\n</td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\">\nD-\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\">\n<center>0</center>\n</td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\">\nF\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table></center>\n\n\n<p>Please note two particularly important consequences of the course grading algorithm:\n\n<ul>\n<li><p> <i>If you fail to pass just one lab exam, your grade in this course will be no higher than a C-</i> &#151;and the more exams you do not pass, the lower your grade in the course.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><i>You can pass all the lab exams and still not get at least a C in the course</i>. Remember, your letter grade is primarily based on your midterm and final exam scores; if those are low, your grade will be low.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We will post scores on the course eee grade sheet as soon as is feasible; it typically takes a few days. <i>Monitor these postings</i>: if you do not see a score for a particular lab exam or  evaluation you turned when scores for the class are posted, <i>promptly</i> contact the person who grades your work&#151;see the Important Information section above; <i>promptly</i> contact the instructor if you do not see your score for the midterm or final. We&#146;ll work with you to determine what has happened. Often, a missing score means you did not turn in your work, or email it to, the right place, or it was lableled improperly to the extent we could not figure out whose work it was. If we can find the item, we&#146;ll grade it; if we cannot, you&#146;ll need to contact the instructor to determine what can be done.\n\n<p>Final course grades, the scores used to compute them, a number of statistics about the class and and discussion of how grades were computed will be available on the course Web page soon after the course is over.\nFollow the links to <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/CourseGradesBefore.html\">Course Grades</a> and \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/NoteOnGrades.html\">A Note on Course Grade Calculation</a> to access that information.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"Cooperation\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>About cooperation</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>As ICS 21 students, you are expected to know and follow UCI and Bren School academic honesty policies; do read them. The ICS policy can be found  (among other\nplaces) on the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php?policy=cheating\">ICS undergraduate web site</a>;  \nthe UCI policy is on the \n<a href=\"http://www.senate.uci.edu/senateweb/default2.asp?active_page_id=754\">UCI Academic Senate site</a>.\n\n<p>In addition to those rules, there are some specific rules regarding student-with-student cooperation in this class:\n\n<p>You may cooperate on the assignments to any degree you wish, including, of course, asking questions of your partner and course staff.\n\n<p>While taking exams, you must do your own work. Among other things, this means <i>you cannot memorize someone else's code &#151;particularly mine or a TA's&#151;and just repeat it on the exam</i>. The tests are closed book (and closed neighbor!), except\nthat for the midterm and final you can use a dictionary and a non-programmable\ncalculator. Lab and retake exams must be taken at the times and in the rooms in which\nthey are scheduled. A violation of these rules will be considered cheating,\nand dealt with accordingly.\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"GettingStarted\"></a>\n<hr>\n\n<p><b>Acknowledgement.</b> Thanks to Prof. David G.
