The key to this assignment is reading\nthe specifications very closely and carefully to extract every bit of necessary\ninformation.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Introduction to spreadsheets:  </B>You\nwill be using the spreadsheet program Excel, part of the Microsoft Office\nsuite of programs.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A spreadsheet program is a visual calculator,\nlaid out in rows and columns like the paper spreadsheets that accountants\nonce used, before they had computers.  The first spreadsheet program, in\n1979, was called VisiCalc.  It ran on the Apple II, and more than any other\nprogram it was responsible for the wide use of personal computers today.\n Before VisiCalc, people used personal computers mainly for word processing\nand for games; VisiCalc opened up a such a wide range of new uses for computers\n(in forecasting, finance, planning, record-keeping, and so on) that sales\nof personal computers soared.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A spreadsheet is a big page filled with boxes.\n The columns are labeled with letters (A, B, C, and so on) and the rows\nwith numbers (1, 2, 3, ...).  The box in the upper left hand corner is called\nA1, since it is on the intersection of column A and row 1.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Each box on the spreadsheet can contain a\nnumber, like 98.7, or a label, like </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Tax\nReturn</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>.  This is called the <I>value</I>\nof the box.  Each box can also contain a <I>formula</I>, such as =A1+B1\n(all formulas in Excel start with an equals sign).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Normally you see the box&#39;s value when\nyou examine the spreadsheet on the computer, whether or not there&#39;s\na formula there too.  But if a box does contain a formula, the value of\nthat box is <I>calculated </I> from the formula.  For instance, if box C3\ncontains the formula =A1*B1, then the spreadsheet looks up the values in\nboxes A1 and B1, multiplies them together, and displays the result as the\nvalue of C3.  If you later change the value of A1 or B1, the spreadsheet\nautomatically figures out (and displays) the new value for C3.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>This automatic updating feature is the key\nto spreadsheets&#39; utility.  For instance, you can set up all the formulas\nfor paying taxes and then play around with various numbers, letting the\nspreadsheet calculate how much tax is due under each scenario.  In a similar\nway, you can set up a spreadsheet to do financial forecasting, keep bowling\naverages, or model the population of goldfish and dragonflies in your ornamental\npond.  In the case of our picture framing service, you can set up an invoice,\nthen change the matting material&#39;s cost and see immediately its effect\non the total amount due.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>In fact, spreadsheets are to numbers what\nword processing programs are to text:  Once the spreadsheet is set up, its\nuser can make whatever changes he or she needs without having to respecify\nthe formulas or calculations, or retype any of the other, unchanged data.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>First spreadsheet (baseball statistics):\n </B>You are the new manager of the California Angels baseball team, and\nyou want to keep a spreadsheet to record a player's batting statistics.\n Completing this assignment shouldn&#39;t require any knowledge about baseball\nbeyond what appears in this document, but feel free to ask your TA or send\nmail to </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"mailto:ics10a@uci.edu\">ics10a@uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\nfor clarification of any details.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part 1:</B>  First, set up a spreadsheet\nthat looks like this (with your own name in the appropriate place, of course):</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"Asst_3A_Spreadsheets_files/Picture_127.gif\" WIDTH=355 HEIGHT=121 ALT=\"\">\n</P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Cell A1 is a label, containing the player&#39;s\nname; Cell A8 is a label containing your name as the manager.  Cells A2\nthrough A7 are also labels; they correspond with the values you will enter\nin B2 through B6.  B2 is the number of times the player came up to bat (i.e.,\ntook a turn to hit the ball) so far this season.  B3 through B6 show how\nmany singles, doubles, triples, and home runs the player made (i.e., how\nfar around the bases the player got each time he hit the ball safely). \nC1, D1, and D3 are also labels.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>B7 and E3 should contain formulas.  B7 is\nthe total of B3 through B6, and E3 is the player's average for the year\n(the total number of hits divided by the number of at-bats).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Now, create a page header to give this spreadsheet\nthe title &quot;Baseball Statistics -- Part 1.&quot;  (Check the on-line\nhelp to find out how to do this.)  Save this spreadsheet (showing the player's\ntotal hits and batting average) in a file called </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">part1.xls</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\nand submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part 2:  </B>Now, you'll modify your spreadsheet\nto keep track of the player's &quot;slugging percentage.&quot;  That's like\nthe batting average, except that a double counts for two hits, a triple\nfor three hits, and a home run for four hits.  Change your spreadsheet to\ninclude the &quot;Total Bases&quot; (that&#39;s the weighted total of the\nhits) and the slugging percentage:</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"Asst_3A_Spreadsheets_files/Picture_112.gif\" WIDTH=356 HEIGHT=122 ALT=\"\">\n</P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>D5 and D6 are labels.  E5 should contain a\nformula that figures out the number of total bases, as described above.\n E6 should calculate the slugging percentage, which is the number of total\nbases (from E5) divided by the at-bats (B2).  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Now change the page header of your spreadsheet\nto read &quot;Baseball Statistics -- Part 2&quot;, save a copy of this spreadsheet\nwith the name </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">part2.xls</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>,\nand submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part 3:  </B>If the player has a hitting\nstreak and hits a lot of triples, the slugging percentage will go up.  Increase\nthe number of triples until the slugging percentage is over 2.00.  How many\ntriples do you have to hit to get to a slugging percentage of 2.00?  Save\nthe spreadsheet that shows this number as a file with the name </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">part3.xls</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\nand submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part 4 (optional):</B>  After you produce\nyour spreadsheets to turn in, you might try to experiment with these items:</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* To make your spreadsheet more readable,\nvary the widths of the columns, move the cells around, change the type styles\nor other formatting (always remembering that the soul of good design is\nrestraint--just because a dozen different type styles are available doesn&#39;t\nmean that the document is improved by using all of them together), or add\ngraphics.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* Try to rearrange all the player's information\nonto one horizontal line; then add further lines for other players, and\nadd statistical totals for each column.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* Modify the page header to include your name,\nthe date, and a page number.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Save the spreadsheet reflecting all these\noptional modifications with the name </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">part4.xls</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\nand submit it via Checkmate.  You&#39;ll get a little extra credit for this,\nthough it won&#39;t substitute for skipping required parts of the assignment.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Second spreadsheet (picture framing):</B>\n The Framous Amos picture framing service has asked you to design a spreadsheet\nto computerize its charging and billing.  Picture framing charges depend\non a number of factors:</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"Asst_3A_Spreadsheets_files/Sidebar_122.gif\" WIDTH=181 HEIGHT=114 HSPACE=6 VSPACE=6 ALIGN=RIGHT>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* The size of the art itself</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* The size of the frame (which may be somewhat\nlarger than the art, to allow for some empty space to set off the art itself)\n</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* The cost of the framing material (plain\nwood is more expensive than plexiglass, for example, and lacquered wood\nis more expensive than plain)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* The cost of the matting material, if any\n(matting, if it&#39;s used, surrounds the art inside the frame, taking up\nthe blank space between the art itself and the frame)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* The cost of the face material, if any (glass,\nplexiglass, or UV-screening plexiglass)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* Any discount given to the customer</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>* Sales tax (which we will assume to be fixed\nat 8.5% for this exercise)</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your spreadsheet will have cells for the user\nto specify each of the following items  (we have also included some example\nvalues the user might enter):</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Client&#39;s name &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>Space\nGallery</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Client&#39;s street address &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>6016\nSanta Monica Blvd.</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Client&#39;s city, state, and Zip code &#160;\n</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>Los Angeles, CA  90038</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Title of the artwork &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>Akira\nKurosaki, Thumbs (1976)</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Height of the artwork in inches &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>7.25</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Width of the artwork in inches &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>9.5</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Height of the frame in inches &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>11.75</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Width of the frame in inches &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>14</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Type of framing material &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>black\nlacquer frame</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Cost per linear inch of framing &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>2.40</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Type of facing material &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>plexiglass\nface</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Cost per square inch of facing &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>0.75</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Type of matting material &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>black\nsilk mat</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Cost per square inch of mat &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>0.12</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Percentage discount (zero if none) &#160;\n</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>15</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Reason for discount &#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><TT>gallery\ndiscount</TT></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The cost of the framing material is given\nper linear inch (an 8-by-10 inch frame is 36 linear inches), the facing\ncost is given per square inch, and the matting cost is given per square\ninch (note that the matting area is the difference between the artwork area\nand the framed area).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>(There really is a print by Akira Kurosaki\ncalled <I>Thumbs</I>.  It&#39;s in David Kay&#39;s office; feel free to\nstop by for a look.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You will use Excel to build a spreadsheet\nthat models the Framous Amos invoice.  It should look essentially like the\nexample shown below: </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"Asst_3A_Spreadsheets_files/Picture_124.gif\" WIDTH=443 HEIGHT=423 ALT=\"\">\n</P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Note particularly how this spreadsheet is\norganized:  The user enters the data in the area above the thick horizontal\nline (we&#39;ve used the data shown in the example above) and the invoice\nitself appears below the line.  The spreadsheet user only needs to type\nabove the line, entering just the bold-faced information.  The spreadsheet\nautomatically calculates everything below the line from the values entered\nabove.  Besides helping to make the data entry task clearer, this organization\nhelps avoid errors; the user is less likely to type over a cell containing\na formula if his or her typing is in a distant part of the spreadsheet.\n (In fact, Excel has a feature that allows the spreadsheet designer to protect\nand lock selected cells, so the user <I>can&#39;t</I> type anything there\nby mistake.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part 1:  </B> Create this spreadsheet as\ndescribed above.  Put your own name into a page header.  Save two copies\nof the spreadsheet, with different data, and submit them via Checkmate.\n</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part 2:</B>  Look closely at the subtotal\nfigure in the example spreadsheet.  It isn&#39;t the correct sum of the\nthree lines above it!  Why not?  Write a two-sentence explanation of what\ncaused the problem, including an example of some <I>other</I> set of three\nnumbers that would cause the same kind of error.  Save your explanation\nand example in a file (either Word or plain text) and submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>(This is not simply some mistake on the part\nof the spreadsheet designer, nor is it a bug in the Excel software.  To\ninvestigate this further, select all the cells in the totals column and\nreformat the numbers (choose Cells from the Format menu, click the Number\ntab, and select the &quot;General&quot; format from the top of the list\nof choices).  Do the numbers you now see add up?  This kind of problem is\ncommon in computing; it&#39;s called &quot;roundoff error,&quot; and it\ncomes from a discrepancy between the data and the way you choose to represent\nit when it&#39;s displayed.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Feel free, within the time available, to make\nthe screen display as clear as possible for the user, taking advantage of\nchanging the column widths, row heights, typefaces, graphics, and so on.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Want to see more?</B>  For a full-blown,\nprofessional web-based framing service, check out the Metropolitan Picture\nFraming site, </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.metroframe.com\">http://www.metroframe.com</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your score will depend on completeness (do\nyour spreadsheets do everything the specification requires; do you answer\nall the questions; and so on), correctness (do they produce the correct\nresults), and quality and clarity of the spreadsheets&#39; format.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT SIZE=1>Written by David G.
