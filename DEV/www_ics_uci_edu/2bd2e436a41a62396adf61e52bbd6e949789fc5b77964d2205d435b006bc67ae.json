Web documents are written in HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).  Web\n documents contains links--that is, if one clicks on the highlighted link--it\n takes one to another document that is identified by a\n <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/urls.html\">URL</A>\n(Uniform Resource Locators).  Many interesting things can be found on the Web\n by <A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html\">\nsubject</A>. \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What is HTML?</H2></A>\nWeb documents are written in HTML(Hypertext Markup Language).  An HTML\n document contains high-lighted links which if one clicks on it--can take them\n to a different document or other resources on the Internet\n(via <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/urls.html\">URL</A>'s within\n the link).  An HTML document is structured so that any Web browser\n(e.g. Mosaic, Netscape, etc...) can read it and display it within the\n capabilities of the computer system that one is working on.  Using HTML,\n one concentrates on the document's structure--<B>NOT</B> on the document's\n appearance--this enables developers of Web documents to express their ideas\n and not have to worry about whether any Web browser will be able to\n interpret and display their pages.  To see what an HTML document looks like,\n if you are using Mosaic, go to the <B>File</B> option and click on\n <B>View Source</B>.  As one can see, &lt; and &gt; \ndominate the document.  These are called tags(sequences of characters \nthat start with &lt; and end with &gt;). \n <A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html\">\nNCSA's Beginner's Guide to HTML</A> has some excellent\n information on how to construct an HTML doucment.  Another good \nreference on HTML documentation is <A \nHREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/htmlindex.html\">Univeristy\n of Toronto's HTML Documentation</A>. \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>What is Mathematics?</H2></A>\nMathematics is the language of science without which we could not possibly\n have our present comfort and progress in civilization.  Just as physics\n describes the the phenomena of nature--mathematics is the language which is\n used to described the phenomena.  What other language in the world is\n understood universally?  It is Mathematics--2 + 2 =4 is understood by\n everybody worldwide. \n <A HREF=\"http://euclid.math.fsu.edu/Science/Specialized.html\">Mathematics</A>\n is a hallowed established science.  Mathematics has been studied\n world-wide since ancient times.  Look at\n <A HREF=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/mathhist/earth.html\">history of\n mathematics by region</A> for interesting contributions in mathematics\n from mathematicians world-wide since the beginning of time.  The\n <A HREF=\"http://www.mathpro.com/math/mathCenter.html\">Internet Guide for\n Mathematics Problems</A> has some Putnam exam questions along with the\n answers. \n \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>Why are math graduate students frustrated?</H2></A>\nIs it because <H3>\n<OL>\n<LI>The program is stressful and difficult?\n<LI>Graduate Advisers give the students the chilly-willys?\n<LI>Reading all those abstract mathematics texts gives them vertigo? \n What actually is a ring?\n<LI>Dealing with undergraduates--i.e. trying to keep your composure when\n you are the teaching assistant for Pre-calculus--a class for those\n undergraduates who haven't taken math since the seventh grade.\n<LI>The job market is lousy for Ph.D mathematicians--especially those seeking\n a tenured-track faculty position at colleges and universities.  One can \nsee this frustration by reading\n <A HREF=\"gopher://e-math.ams.org/11/genInfo/cym\">\nConerns of Young Mathematicians</A>.\n<LI>Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem has some holes in it.\n<LI>They should have been in the <A HREF=\"http://mat.gsia.cmu.edu\">\nOperations Research</A>(mathematical modelling of real-world problems)\n program instead--that's where all the big money is along with\n <A HREF=\"http://src.doc.ic.ac.uk/bySubject/Computing/Overview.html\">Computer\n Science</A>.\n</OL> \n</H3>\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>How does one become a successful graduate student?</H2></A>\nFor any of you who are considering continuing your education with a \ngraduate degree should take a look at\n <A HREF=\"http://www.cs.umbc.edu/cmsc/graduate/info.html\">Information for\n Graduate Students</A>.  This Web page is basically for computer science\n graduate students but it has some relevant and worthwhile topics to\n consider--including Piroz Mohseni's\n <A HREF=\"http://www.cs.umbc.edu/cmsc/graduate/apply-to-gradschool.ps\">A\n Guide for Applying to Graduate Schools</A>. One should also research\n potential graduate schools and their programs--a good place to start is\n <A HREF=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/cdemello/univ.html\">College and\n University Home Pages</A>.  Some quick tips: \n<H3> \n<UL>\n<LI>Start the process early--preferably when you are a sophomore or junior\nin undergraduate study.\n<LI>Investigate some schools that you are interested in applying to--that\nway you can structure your undergraduate course work so as to meet their\nrequirements.\n<LI>Prepare for the GRE(Graduate Record Exam).  Everyone must take the\nGeneral GRE--some schools may require you to take the Subject GRE also--\ncheck the programs that you are interested in applying to.\n<LI>Try to maintain a good GPA.  Most schools require that you have at\nleast a 3.0 to apply.\n<LI>Get to know <B>AT LEAST THREE or FOUR professors reasonably well</B>, i.e.,\nattend lectures regularly, attend their office hours, and do reasonably well\nin their class.  This is important since most graduate programs require three\nletters of recommendations--at least two must be from academia. \n<LI>Write your Statement of Purpose <B>AT LEAST TWO MONTHS IN ADVANCE</B>.\nYou should also have at least two people to proofread and evaluate your\nStatement.\n<LI>When you ask letters of reference from your professors--make sure you\ninclude the necessary forms, a copy of your current transcript, a copy of\nyour Statement of Purpose, and stamped envelopes for the schools that\nyou are applying to.  <B>MOST IMPORTANTLY, WRITE A THANK-YOU LETTER TO THE\nPROFESSOR--HEY, THEY'RE DOING YOU A FAVOR!!</B>\n<LI>Be aware of deadlines for the schools that you are applying to!!\n</UL>\n</H3>  \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted January 30, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
