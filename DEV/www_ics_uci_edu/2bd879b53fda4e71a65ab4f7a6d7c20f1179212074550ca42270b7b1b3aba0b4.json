In addition to\n  scheduled lab time for this class, you can drop in on any of the\n  following labs to have access to a computer with Matlab. If the room\n  is being used by an instructor as part of their schedule lab time,\n  you can ask them if you can use one of the computers during their\n  class.\n<ul>\n<li>ICS 365.

For private questions, send email with your\n  questions to all the teaching staff for quicker response. Subject\n  line should start with the string `ICS 6N`. The message should\n  contain your name and student number.</li>\n<li>You are responsible for anything communicated in class by the\n  instructor, including class announcements. If you have to miss\n  lecture for any reason, please ask one of your classmates to fill\n  you in on what you missed. You can use the message board to ask\n  general questions that your classmates can answer.</li>\n<li>Lab time is an important time to get questions answered about\n  homework problems and labs. Some lab time will be spent walking you\n  through features of Matlab that you will need for your lab\n  assignments. Lab time is the best time for troubleshooting issues\n  that come up with Matlab or lab assignments.</li>\n<li>Questions about grading should be asked to the person who graded\n  your paper during his/her office hours or by appointment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<dt>Academic\n    Honesty </dt>\n<p>The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established\n  an academic honesty policy. Read it.</p>\n<p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties\n  described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to\n  an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop\n  the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single\n  documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from\n  switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors,\n  joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing\n  major with honors.</p>\n\n<dt>Guidelines to avoid plagiarism</dt>\n<p>Do not look at another person's homework. Instead you should prefer\n  to discuss the problem in plain English. This helps you to\n  communicate clearly, practice technical jargon as it applies to your\n  problem, and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior\n  different from what you expect.</p>\n<p>Do not write down the solution in your notes. It is perfectly fine\n  (and encouraged) to collaborate on work. Working in a group is a\n  rewarding experience, and definitely a necessary skill in any\n  professional career. The collaboration can include drawing diagrams\n  and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard. However, you should\n  avoid writing the solution in your notes. It is very useful to\n  rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you\n  solve it again on your own.</p>\n\n<dt>We expect\n    that </dt>\n<p>You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among\n  yourselves. Making sure that others follow these guidelines will\n  help to ensure that they don't pass off your work as their own.</p>\n<p>Your work honestly represents your efforts. The entire purpose of\n  obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of\n  skills and experience that will help you later on. If you do not\n  perform the work yourself, then you have cheated yourself out of the\n  education. Employers in our field can (and do) screen applicants for\n  skills and knowledge. You will perform poorly (and discredit UCI) if\n  you do not practice now by doing your own work.</p>\n\n\n\n</dl>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
