Try to work with people you haven&#39;t\nworked with before.  (There&#39;s a separate page of guidelines for the\nr&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter; consult that one if you&#39;re doing\nthat alternative.) <BR>\nHere are two excerpts from the assignment:\n<BR>\nAny change in an existing system is likely to disrupt the system&#39;s current\nusers.  If your change were implemented, you would want to reassure the\ncurrent users that the new system will be better for them&mdash;to &quot;sell\nthem,&quot; in other words, on your changes. <BR>\nFinally, you will prepare a one-page flyer, brochure, memo, or web page\nannouncing, describing, and promoting your change to the current users of\nthe system.  This &quot;promotion piece&quot; may be one- or two-sided and\nmay be relatively informal in tone&mdash;just so that it gets the message across\nwithout its readers dismissing it as a joke. <BR>\nGreat flexibility is possible in the form and content of these pieces, but\n(a) they must do the job (in this case, make the users of the current system\nwant to use the changed system), (b) use clear, correct, grammatical English,\nand (c) follow the principles of good design and typography.</FONT><BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"I\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Talk to the author. Does the author expect\nthe users to be eager to use the changes, or resistant to change, or hard\nto convince in some other way?  What problems of persuasion does the author\nanticipate?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Read your classmate&#39;s paper once through\nwithout making any comments.  Then, write down briefly your first impressions:</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"A\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Do mechanical errors get in the way of reading\nit?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Is it well organized and easy to follow?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does it do the job?  If you were a user of\nthe current system, would this piece make you more likely to try out the\nchanged system?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n</OL>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Read it again, more carefully, making specific\ncomments in the margins.  Focus your comments on the organization and content;\ndon&#39;t spend much time proofreading for spelling or grammatical errors.\n (But mention it to the author if you do find many mechanical errors.) \nWhat changes would help the author get the message across?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Can you list three ways in which the typography\nand design actually <I>help</I> the piece to do its job?  Can you list ways\nin which they interfere, and suggest improvements?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Review your comments with the author (and\nvice versa).  Be sure to include your name as editor with your written comments\nand return those comments to the author, who must include them with the\nturned-in version.  Likewise, be sure to get the written comments of your\neditor(s).</FONT></LI>\n</OL>\n<BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
