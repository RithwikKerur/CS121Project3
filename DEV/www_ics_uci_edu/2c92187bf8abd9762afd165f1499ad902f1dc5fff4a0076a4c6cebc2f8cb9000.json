The other teams they are competing against are the Astros, Athletics, Mariners, and Rangers. If the Angels win all their remaining games, they can afford to let the Astros and Mariners win two games each, and the Athletics and Rangers win one game each. Each pair of the four competing teams will play one more game against each other (six games total), not counting their games against the Angels. Draw a flow network that models the baseball elimination problem for these teams.</p></li>\n<li><p>Draw or describe a maximum flow for the network you set up in the previous question. You do not have to show your steps. Does this flow show that the Angels are eliminated, or do they still have a scenario for winning? Explain your answer.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
