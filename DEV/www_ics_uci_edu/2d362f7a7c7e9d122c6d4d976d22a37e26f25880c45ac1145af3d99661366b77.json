Suppose we are given a sequence of n numbers as input, within which\nwe wish to find range minima for contiguous subsequences. We form a\nCartesian tree from the numbers, converting the range minimum problem\ninto an LCA problem, and then form an Euler tour of the Cartesian tree,\nconverting the LCA problem back into a range minimum problem again.\nWhat is the length of the sequence for this transformed problem?\n\n2. Suppose we are given a computer communications network in the form of\na tree, and wish to determine the bandwidth between any pair of nodes in\nthe tree. Each link of the tree has a bandwidth, and the bandwidth\nbetween nodes is the minimum bandwidth of any link on the path\nconnecting them. Describe how to generalize the Cartesian tree idea so\nthat this minimum bandwidth problem can be transformed into an LCA\nproblem on a related tree.\n\n3. Let T be an alpha-balanced binary tree, for some constant\n0 < alpha < 1/2. Suppose we wish to use the jump table method to compute\nlevel ancestors in T, rather than the more complex method described in\nlecture with linear space and constant query time. What would be the\nspace and query time bounds for jump tables on T?\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
