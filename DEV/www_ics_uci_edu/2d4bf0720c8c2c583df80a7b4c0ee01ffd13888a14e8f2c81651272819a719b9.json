As an Armenian,\nI am well aware of the Armenian Genocide of 1915, during whcih 1.5\nmillion Armenians were slaughtered in Turkey. In the\nbeginnings of World War II, Hitler gave a speech to a group of military\nmen describing his plan for the \"Final Solution\" for the Jewish Question.\nIn that speech he said that the Nazi plan for the Jews would go\nrelatively unnoticed by the international community: Hitler asked\nrhetorically, \"Who remembers the Armenians?\" Growing up in Skokie, Illinois,\na predominantly Jewish suburb, I came to understand how the Holocaust left an\nindellible mark on the collective Jewish psyche, much like the Genocide\nfor the Armenians and slavery for African Americans. I would like to educate\nmyself on the historical facts surrounding the Holocaust by defining the\nkey terminology associated with the Holocaust and providing a \nhistorical overview of this period. Amidst revisionist writers who claim that the Holocaust never happened,\nthe need to learn the historical truth and pass it down is ever more\nimportant. Thus, this paper will provide a historical road map of the\nHolocaust and the experiences of those who endured and surived.\n<hr><P>\n<h2> Why Study the Holocaust?</h2>\nThe Holocaust was a <A HREF=\"http://www.ushmm.org/education/guidelines.html\">\nwatershed event</A> which was historically unprecedented in scope. It reveals \nthe disastrous consequences of prejudice, racism, and social and political scapegoating that\nare endemic in any society. The German example also shows that <A HREF= \"\nhttp://www.ushmm.org/education/guidelines.html\">democratic institutions</A> are not\npermanent political fixtures. Rather, they can be overturned, as did occur in Germany,  if \ncitizens are not politically aware. By studying the Holocaust and the horrific effects this\nhistorical event had on a certain contingent of society, we can  gain understanding\nof past history in hopes of preventing the repetition of it.\n<h1>Terms Used in this Paper</h1>\n<h2>What is the Holocaust? </h2><p>\nAlthough volumes of academic literature has been written on the Jewish Holocaust, \na brief summary and definition of the <A HREF=\"http://www.ushmm.org/education/5quest.html>\nHolocaust</A> is in order. The Holocaust was the destruction of some six million Jews\nby the Nazis and their followers in Europe between the years 1933-1945. Other individuals\nand groups suffered grievously such as homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses, and political dissidents\nduring this period. But only the Jews were marked\nfor complete and utter annihalation. The term Holocaust means literally <A \nHREF= \"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?holocaust\">a completely\nburned sacrifice</A>. It tends to suggest a sacrificial connotation to what occurred. \nThe word Shoah, originally a Biblical term meaning widespread disaster, is the modern\nHebrew equivalent. The Holocaust was a state-sponsored, bureaucratized, and sytematic\nextermination of European Jewry. The events surrounding the Holocaust occurred in two \nmain historical phases: <A HREF=\"#history\">1933-1939 and\n1939-1945</A>.  \n\n<h2> Who were the Nazis?</h2>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ushmm.org/education/5quest.html\"> \n<p>\"Nazi\" </A> is a short term for the National Socialist German Workers Party. This was a \nright-wing political party originally established in  1919 primarily by unemployed German \nveterans of World War I. In January 1933, Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor of a coalition\ncabinet. Hitler, who took office on January 30, 1933, immediately set up a dictatorship.\n In 1934, the chancellorship and presidency were united in the person of the \nFuhrer.  The Nazi party ideology was strongly anti-Communist, antisemitic, racist,\nnationalistic, imperialistic and militaristic. During this totalitarian period, all other\nparties were outlawed and opposition was brutally suppressed. He ended German democracy \nand severely restricted basic rights such as freedom of personal and marital relations, \nfreedom of speech, press and assembly. The Nazis even intervened in the bedroom and \nprohibited inter-racial marriage and sexual relations! Hitler and the Nazis succeeded in  \nestablishing  a brutal dictatorship that defined people by race and punished \ndissidents through a vicious reign of terror. This created an atmosphere of fear,\ndistrust and suspicion in which people betrayed their neighbors. This all helped the Nazis\nto obtain control over social institutions such as the civil service, the \neducational system, churches, the judiciary, industry, business and other professions. </p>\nAccording to Holocaust file, \"The Nazi legacy was a vast empire of murder, pillage, and exploitation that had\naffected every country of occupied Europe. The toll in lives was enormous. The full\nmagnitude, and the moral and ethical implications, of this tragic era are only now\nbeginning to be understood more fully\" (click here for reference A <HREF=\n\"http://www.ushmm.org/education/history.html\">Holocaust</A>\n\n\n<h2>What were the concentration camps?</h2>\nImmediately upon their assumption of power on January 30, 1933, the Nazis established \nconcentration campus for the imprisonment of all \"enemies\" of their regime: actual and\npotential political opponents including communists, socialists, bolsheviks, gypsies, \nhomosexuals, and other asocials. Beginning in 1938, Jews were targeted for internment solely\nbecause they were Jews. Before then, only Jews that fit one of the earlier categories\nwere interned in campus. The first three concentration campus established were Dachau \n(near Munich), Buchenwald (near Weimar) and Sachsenhausen (near Berlin).\n<A HREF= \"http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/archive/holocaust.auschwitz.part01.html\">\nAuschwitz </A> became\nthe most notorious of concentration camps. It was both a labor and extermination camp in\nupper Silesia, Poland, 37 miles west of Krakow. Established in 1940 as a concentration camp, it became \nan extermination center in 1942.  Forced labor,\nmedical experimentation, along with extermination were the goals of the camps.\nThe Auschwitz extermination procedure evolved in stages. \"In April 1942,\n      Slovak Jews were gassed in Crematorium I, apparently with their\n      clothes on.  Later, deportees from nearby Sosnowiec were told\n      to undress in the yard.  The victims, faced by the peremptory\n      order to remove their clothes, men in front of women and women\n      in front of men, became apprehensive.  The SS men, shouting at\n      them, then drove the naked men, women and children into the gas\n      chamber\"(click here for reference <A HREF= \"http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/archive/holocaust.auschwitz.part01.html\"\n>Auschwitz</A>). \n<A NAME=\"history\"><h1> Historical Overview</h1></A>\nThe first measures taken by the Nazis against the Jews began in 1933. On April 1 of this year, the \nNazis organized a boycott of Jewish shops and businesses by the Nazis. Later that week, the law for\nthe Re-establishment of the Civil Service expelled all non-Aryans (defined as anyone with a Jewish\nparent or grandparent) from the civil service. Initially, exceptions were made for those working\nsince August 1914, German veterans of WWI, and those who had lost a father or son fighting for Germany\nor her allies in WWI. Later on in the same year, Jews were prohibited from becoming practicing\nlawyers, physicians, civil servants, and academics. Jewish enrollment in German high schools also\nwas limited to 1.5% of the student body. Jews were forced into creating their own schools and \nsubculture away from mainstream Germany in order to survive. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, the events of the Holocaust can be categorized historically in <A HREF=\n\"http://www.ushmm.org/education/history.html\"> two main phases</A>.\n<OL>\n<LI> From <B>1933-1939</B>, the politics\nof daily German life took a distinctly anti-Jewish slant. During this time period, intermittent\nattacks on invidual Jewish businesses and people, as well as the institutionalization of \nracism took place. Beginning in 1933, laws were put into place that essentially excluded Jews\nfrom the economy. They could no longer work in a vast array of professions and could not own\ntheir own businesses in many districts. Thus, the Nazis succeeded their legal channels of slowly\nmarginalizing the Jewish community and disarming them of their property, money, and influence in\nsociety. \n<LI> From <B>1939-1945</B> instituted the second phase of the Holocaust. On September 1, 1939, Germany\n invaded Poland and World War II began. Within\ndays, the Polish army was defeated and the Nazis began their campaign to destroy\nthose non-Aryans whom they viewed as \"subhuman.\" This second phase was characterized by the\nsame racist ideology as the earlier period with one main difference. After 1939, the racism and\nintermittent harassment of Jews became more serious and bureaucratized. No longer were just\na few Jews that the SS found displeasing harassed, but the whole Jewish population in Germany.\nGhettos were set up in order that Germans could \"relocate\" Jews in their own quarters within\nGermany. During this period, camps were set up and 6 million Jews ultimately killed. The war ended\nin 1945 and brought some, but not all, Nazi war criminals to justice through the Nuremberg Trials.\n</P>\n\n<A HREF= \"#intro\">Return to Introduction</A>\n<OL>\n<h2>References Used in this Work</h2>\n<LI><A HREF=\"gopher://israel.nysernet.org/11/holocaust\">gopher://israel.nysernet.org/11/holocaust</A><BR>\nThis is a general information site on the Holocaust.\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.ushmm.org/\">http://www.ushmm.org/</A><BR>\nThis directory gives an overview of the events surrounding\nthe Holocaust including testimonies and chronology\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://shamash.nysernet.org/trb/judaism.html\">http://shamash.nysernet.org/trb/judaism.html</A><BR>\nThis is the Directory of Judaism and Jewish resources.\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/by_category.holocaust.html\"\n>http://www.lib.ox.ac.uk/internet/news/faq/by_category.holocaust.html</A><BR>\nThis directory provides facts on the Holocaust survivors,\nthe death camps and conditions, as well as historical events.\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/tdnguyen/Holocaust.html\n\">http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/tdnguyen/Holocaust.html\n</A><BR>\nThis gives information on testimonies and Nazi history.\n</OL>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<!-----===\n---->\nCurrent as of March 16, 1995\nfor <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
