As undirected\nst-connectivity is complete for the class of problems solvable by\nsymmetric, non-deterministic, log-space computations (the class SL),\nthis algorithm implies that SL&nbsp;=&nbsp;L (where L is the class of problems\nsolvable by deterministic log-space computations).</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
