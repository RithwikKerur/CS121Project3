He married Jenny, of Tarnow, Poland, born about 1888. They had three children. His wife predeceased him and he married a woman named Golda.

In 1916 they were living in Brooklyn at 162 Harrison Avenue with their two oldest children. The FHC's Krakow birth index lists an Izak Langsam, born in 1888, Akt 401, film 1895667. An Abraham Aba is listed next, born 1889, Akt 260, film 1895667. The father of the H19 Leon Langsam is known to have been Avrohm Aba. This seems to be another indication that H59 and H19 are connected.
