Avrunin Ugo Buy and James Corbett in Technical Report 90-032,\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1990.\n\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nThis report describes a prototype tool for automating the generation of \nsystems of inequalities, and for aiding in the interpretation of the \nsolutions of such systems, in the analysis of constrained expressions. \nThe constrained expression approach to the analysis of concurrent and \ndistributed software systems is described in [4,5]; more detailed \ndescriptions of the use of inequalities in such analysis are given in \n[2,5,6]. This prototype implements a piece of a toolset supporting automated \nanalysis of distributed system designs written in the CEDL design language \n[11], which is based on Ada. The structure of the toolset and its \napplication are described briefly in the next section and in more detail \nin [4]. Detailed discussions of the other components of the toolset are \ngiven in [1,7,9,12].  This document describes version 2.0 of the prototype, \nwhose implementation has been completed recently.\n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 26 13:36:30 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
