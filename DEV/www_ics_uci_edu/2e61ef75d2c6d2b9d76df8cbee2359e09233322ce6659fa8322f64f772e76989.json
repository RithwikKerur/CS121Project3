Jim W: right.\n\nRoy doesn't define representation, but it's something like the entity that gets included\nin a GET response.\n\nIn the weather example, there are supposed to be two resources associated with\nthe same representation.\n\nGeoff: We want clients to be able to control sharing.  A change in the state should be\nvisible through all the bindings.\n\nJudy: Jason proposed collapsing resource and state.  Won't that get us what we need?\nJim W: No, it won't handle dynamic content.  There we need to distinguish between state\nand resource.  The resource is the output of the cgi script.  [Judy: why isn't that the\nrepresentation? What actually is the resource in this case?]\n\nGeoff: We want PUT at URL 1 to be reflected at URL 2.  For static resources, the state\nand representation are both the contents of some file, say, and PUT changes the content of\nthe file.  For dynamic resources, PUT changes the state (the cgi script), and so changes the\nrepresentations it generates. \n\nBIND may fail in some situations (cgi script) or into tar file.  Not everything is\nsharable. \n\nWe wouldn't need DELETE if we could get a list of all the bindings to a given resource\nand UNBIND each.\n\nGeoff: The HTTP spec is loose in its definitions of delete and resource.  As long as we are\ncareful to understand DELETE to have the least harmful results (delete less rather than\nmore) we should be all right.\n\nJudy:  We could just define UNBIND, and let versioning define DELETE to make it precise\nin whatever way it needs for versioning servers.  Since HTTP's definition is so vague, \nprobably specifying more precisely what versioning servers will do in response to DELETE\nwill be ok. \n\nVersioning servers want to interoperate with DELETE requests from Office 2000 applications.\nSo they do want to go back and clean up DELETE.\n\nChuck: Is there any practice (as opposed to the HTTP spec) that we can appeal to in\nchoosing a semantics for DELETE? We might end up fighting about which platform is more \nimportant, and actual practice might not be good semantic basis anyhow.\n\nExperience so far: mod_put deletes individual resources, responds with an error for \ncollections; netscape and aol allow delete on collections.\n\nJim W: Don't put existing practice into the spec.\nChuck: If things were ill-defined in the past, and we define something clear, we won't\nget interoperability with down-level clients. \nGeoff: Define DELETE to be the least damaging possible: delete the least possible thing\n(a single binding).\nChuck: Intuitively, delete means that stuff is gone.  That is, it's not accessible any more.\nGeoff: Separate intuitiveness from the principle of least harm.  Least harm is more\nimportant.\nJim W: Redefine DELETE so that 200 response means that GET wont work in the future.  \nMake it optional whether to destroy state or not.\nGeoff: When an Office 2000 client issues delete, we don't want the server to fail.\nChuck: The issue he wanted to raise is not about whether the server has to destroy the\nstate or not, but about whether only one binding is removed while others remain.\n\nJim W: Let's leave DELETE vague.  At a minimum, it just removes one binding, but it may do\nanything up to destroying the state.  We'll define UNBIND and DESTROY precisely, and if\nyou (the client) care about a precise result, you will use UNBIND or DESTROY.\nJudy: good\nGeoff: good\n\nChuck: What is the versioning scenario that needs DELETE to do only an unbind?\n\nGeoff:  If you bind URL to versioned resource or to a revision, if you interpret DELETE as\nremoving all bindings to the revision or versioned resource would have bad consequences on \nthe history and on any other client in a different view seeing the revision. Delete just \nmeans I don't want to see it in my workspace any more. Once people are used to living with \nothers working with the same resources, they will get used to thinking of DELETE as just \n\"remove from my view\".\n\nGeoff: A workspace maps URLs to specific revisions of things.  You commit when you are\nfinished working.  If you do a delete in that context, it means in your workspace only.\nOthers accept your changes when they are ready.  And aside from issues of sharing, you\nwant the revision to continue to exist for the history anyway.\n\nIs it important for down-level clients to be able to manipulate workspaces? Geoff thinks\nyes.\n\nChuck: If we keep fuzzy delete semantics, the user may not get what he wants.\n\nChuck: Thought Geoff would not want to leave delete ill-defined.  Geoff is unsure right now,\nbut thinks it's ok. The versioning server can do what it likes, and down-level clients\nknow they can't count on any particular DELETE behavior.\n\nJim W: A successful DELETE means future GET requests will get 404 responses.  That's all \nthat is needed.\n\nJim W: Thinks the consistency maintenance language in rfc 2518 (where it says that all\nbindings for a resource get removed on DELETE) may need to be removed, and\nis willing to promote this change.  This change would be ok because it's on the edge and \nclients are not being written to it.  Geoff: good. Judy: good.\n\nJudy: That language in 2518 was making it difficult to claim that the two definitions of\nMOVE are logically equivalent. (BIND / DELETE = COPY / fixup / DELETE) \n\nJim W: Would like to define PUT and DELETE better, as Larry suggested.  Don't let PUT create\nattributed collections.  In a separate proposal.\n\nChuck: Relate what we are proposing to DMA in the areas of containment and deletion.  \nDMA is more explicit, and has fewer side effects.  In DMA, there is an explicit binding \nobject.  A container has links to binding objects, and objects contained in\ncontainers have links to binding objects.  So you can easily delete exactly what you want.  \nThere is also a distinction between direct vs referential containment.  An object is directly\ncontained in exactly one container, and that is where it \"really\" lives.\n\nGeoff: Our redirect referece is more that style.  We got rid of it for direct references\nbecause it was causing us difficulties in figuring out appropriate semantics for COPY and\nLOCK.\n\nChuck: There is no object model here.  An object model does make things simpler.  Making the\nbindings into objects does make things simpler.\n\nRoy's message does propose an object model with 3 levels.\n\nChuck: A more explicit object model, with fewer side effects, would be better.  He is\nconcerned about leaving ambiguities in DELETE.  To the extent that client can't predict \nwhat the server will do, we lose interoperability.\n\nGeoff: That's true for down-level servers anyway.  But we will introduce something we'll\ndefine more precisely: UNBIND and DESTROY.\n\nChuck: We can't fix what's been done, but we can make new capabilities precisely defined.  \nBe careful to be precise when defining UNBIND and DESTROY.  An object model may be needed\nto get it right.\n\nSERVER-MAINTAINED ORDERINGS\n\nMax seemed content with what is in the spec at 3.2.  He did suggest adding a human-readable \ndescription for each advertised server-maintained ordering. \nJim W: Let's not do that.  It would raise internationalization issues, and possibly also\nrequire content-negotiation.\n\nWhere would a developer go for a canonical list of orderings?  IANA?  Add something to IANA \nconsiderations -- a form for registration, specifying what information to include when\nregistering an ordering: English-language description or reference to an  informational rfc,\ncanonical identifier, contact, security considerations.  Judy and Jim: ok.\n\nSince Max will use this feature in his server, let's leave it in and see how it goes.\n\nCOMMENTS ON SPECIFICATION 03.2\n\nNo one is ready to comment.  Be ready for next week.\n\nJim W now has the spec and will revise it this week.  Judy will work on a new UNBIND\nsection while Jim edits.", "encoding": "ascii"}
