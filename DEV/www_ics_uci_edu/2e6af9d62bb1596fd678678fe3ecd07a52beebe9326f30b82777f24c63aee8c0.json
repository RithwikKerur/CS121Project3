When large groups of people are using a widely distributed\nsystem, old notions of \"one person, one terminal\" as the basis for design\nare inadequate. Bannon (1990) makes a similar point in discussing his \u2018pilgrim\u2019s\nprogress\u2019 away from the individualized, cognitivist notions of HCI. Kling\nand Scacchi\u2019s classic notion, the \"web of computing,\" seeks to expand beyond\nthe single user terminal and formal program stereotype to locate design\nin a larger context of usability, the workplace and its social networks\n(1982). King and Star (1990) apply the scale-up problem to decision support\nsystems, noting that the scale-up from decision support (DSS) to group\ndecision support (GDSS) to organizational decision support (ODSS) is a\ncomplex one, involving issues of social justice, multiple interpretations,\nand adjudication of conflict across social boundaries. Within the field\nof computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and the design of large-scale\ninformation systems such as digital libraries, scale questions are at the\nheart of design. What is the proper unit of analysis for design -- group,\norganization, community, network? What does a community interface, or system,\neven look like?\n\n<P><I>&nbsp;</I>\n\n<P>In this paper, we parallel these and other lines of scale inquiry about\ninformation systems to ask similar questions about the concept of transparency.\nA system is transparent if the user does not have to be bothered with the\nunderlying \"stuff\" driving it, just as an automobile is transparent when\none sits down, turns the key, and drives off without the foggiest notion\nof how internal combustion works. Total transparency, like the ultimate\n\"killer app\", is of course an ideal type, nowhere to be found in the real\nworld (everyone\u2019s car stalls now and then, or has its little idiosyncrasies\nrequiring a deeper involvement with the tool). We define transparency here\nto include the idea of relative usability, and computer tools and interfaces\nwhich are basically ready to hand for some group of users.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>Scaling of transparency means that we must have an idea about:\n\n<P><I>&nbsp;</I>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Symbol\">&middot; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">for\nwhom (and when and where) is a particular tool transparent;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Symbol\">&middot; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">what\nhappens when levels of transparency differ across involved groups;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Symbol\">&middot; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">how\ndoes something become invisibly usable at the individual, community, and\nlarger levels of scale, and with what differences in process and design\ncontent?;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Symbol\">&middot; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">how\nare newcomers to a community taught how to make a tool, interface, or retrieval\nsystem transparent?</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">We seek in this paper to provide\na description of information interaction with which to understand the <I>continuum\nof usefulness</I> of information organization and access. Transparency\nand ease of use are products of an alignment of facets of information resources\nand social practices; each of these facets are interrelated and in motion.\nIn scaling up transparency, we wish to avoid fallacies of universalism;\nof an idealist concept of pure information devoid of locale or of the politics\nof knowledge; or a scenario which begs questions of material resources\nand infrastructure. Our research has been geared toward the real world\nuse and design of information systems. It is always embodied, always historical,\nand always embedded in infrastructure.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">One impetus for clarifying a scaled-up\nidea of transparency comes from changes in the information landscape itself.\nIn the current wave of building and research on digital libraries and information\ninfrastructure, we find places and possibilities where new kinds of arrangements\nare being forged for information organization and access. Pockets that\nhave been semi-autonomous until now are getting interconnected, including\nwidespread federations of information repositories. One such example is\nthe Illinois Digital Library Initiative. One of the goals of this project\nis to create seamless interconnection of federated repositories.<B> </B>Also,\ntraditional models of information retrieval are being turned completely\nupside down; they can no longer presume an individual user, an information\nintermediary such as a librarian, and a repository with discrete documents\nwhich are then returned to the workplace or home. Information (documents\nand multimedia) is being fractured and distributed in different ways across\nthe work-/play- scape. Thus a fuller understanding of people, their activities,\nand the scaling of transparency is especially crucial for a social informatics\nof digital libraries, but applies as well to other complex and large scale\ninformation systems (Bishop and Star, 1996).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n<OL>\n<LI>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Helvetica,Arial\">Transparency Results from the Convergence\nof Social Worlds and Information Artifacts</FONT></B></LI>\n</OL>\n<FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">We will explore in this paper\nthe use of the concept of convergence for understanding scaled up transparency.\nIt is a concept designed to bridge between social worlds (including membership\nand practices) and information artifacts \"Social world\" is a term in sociology\nfirst coined by Anselm Strauss (1978b). It refers to a group of people\njoined by conventions, language, practices and technologies. It may or\nmay not be contained in a single spatial territory; in the modern world,\nit typically is not. It is cognate with the notion of community of practice\n(Lave and Wenger, 1992), and with reference groups. It was coined for social\nanalysis in order to speak to strong ties which are neither family nor\nformal organization, nor voluntary association, and which may be highly\ngeographically dispersed. Examples of social worlds are stamp collectors,\nrock climbers, activity theorists, and socialist feminists. Social worlds\nmay segment (divide into subgroups) or intersect (have partial overlapping\nconcerns); the degree to which they engage members or are voluntary is\nvariable (Star, 1994). We use the term information artifact to mean a wide\narray of tools, systems, interfaces and devices for storing, tracking,\ndisplaying and retrieving information, whether they be paper or electronic\nor other materials.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\"><I>Convergence</I> as defined\nin this paper is the double process by which information artifacts and\nsocial worlds are fitted to each other and come together. On the one hand,\na given information artifact (a classification system, a database, an interface,\nand so forth) is partially constitutive of some social world. That is to\nsay, the sharing of information resources and tools is a dimension of any\ncoherent social world - be it the world of homeless people in Los Angeles\nsharing survival knowledge via street gossip, or the world of high energy\nphysicists sharing electronic preprints via the Los Alamos archive. On\nthe other hand, any given social world itself generates many interlinked\ninformation artifacts. The social world creates through bricolage, a (loosely\ncoupled but relatively coherent) set of information resources and tools.\nPeople without houses also log into the Internet, and physicists indulge\nin street gossip at conferences - as well as engage in a whole set of other\ninformation practices (Palmer, 1996). Put briefly, information artifacts\nundergird social worlds, and social worlds undergird these same information\nresources. We will use the concept of convergence to describe this process\nof mutual constitution.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">In order to recognize this mutual\nstructuration, we employ a term used by Elfreda Chatman (1985, 1991, 1992)\n- \"information world.\" This term refers to all spheres of information resources\nemployed by an individual, organization, institution, or other group in\norder to solve problems, learn, play, and work. They may be formal as in\nlibraries and databases, but they are also informal, as in asking one's\nfamily and friends for opinions on health matters, or how to evaluate a\nparticular book or film. Such resources are also material, in the sense\nthat they are enabled and constrained by time, transportation, and material\ncultural practices. Information artifacts and social worlds <I>converge</I>\nto form information worlds in Chatman\u2019s sense.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">We will through three examples\nexplore how convergence occurs. First, we discuss how convergence is experienced\nby individuals as academic researchers. Second, we examine a study of nursing\nclassification wherein nursing researchers are seeking to make their classification\nof nursing activities part of the social worlds of professional medical\npractice. Finally, we describe the convergence that subtends a global,\nwell established information collection and analysis system administered\nby the World Health Organization- the International Classification of Disease.\nThis is convergence that goes beyond a single occupation, nationality,\nor locale; in fact, it consists in the end of a number of intersecting\ninformation worlds. It speaks to the ways in which multiple overlapping\nsystems support each other (that is, in the case of convergence; it could\nof course go the other way with divergence and incompatible structures),\nacross significant space and time.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Through each case, we will examine\nthe operation of key feedback processes which underwrite the (ever partial)\nfitting-together of social worlds and information artifacts. We will then\ndiscuss how the concept of convergence can be of use in developing the\nintegration of sociological and informational analysis towards which much\nrecent work in library and information science has pointed.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n<LI>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Helvetica,Arial\"><FONT SIZE=+1>Convergence and the Individual:\nMembership and Transparent Information Retrieval Go Hand in Hand</FONT></FONT></B></LI>\n\n\n<P><I><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT></I>\n\n<P><I><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">I: How do you find information\nor references?</FONT></I>\n\n<P><I><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">R: Often a paper comes across\nmy desk, it is an archaeological dig here. . . simply because I will review\narticles or journal submissions and something seems interesting and I will\nfile it.

This is the person who can put\ntheir fingers on things, who sits at the metaphorical center of the social\nweb, who can tweak a vast complex and mature system of social networks\nto \"get stuff.\" This is a person for whom the system is quite transparent.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>At the other end of the spectrum is the person who sees the information\nsystem as confusing, chaotic, insurmountable, unusable; who tries to follow\ngiven directions and misses by a mile and a half. Much professional socialization\nconcerns moving from this lost state into the state of obviousness or naturalness.\nAnalysis at this individual level asks how people adapt to, and work around,\nformal structures when they don't fit; how they put together and maintain\nnetworks which \"feed\" their work; and how to understand the interaction\nbetween vernacular and formal systems of information and classification.\nFor example, professors will point to articles they review or items colleagues\nsend them as more important information resources than the library.\n\n<P><B>&nbsp;</B>\n\n<P>Convergence for the apprentice professional is a trajectory: the shaping\nof the individual so that they see themselves as having the set of information\nneeds that can be met by their new social world's information resources.\nAs the individual moves along this trajectory, they both learn a field\nthat they can \"put their mark\" on and are changed by their socialization\nso that their original \"information needs\" are not the same as their final\nones. For the individual, this feedback process, especially the ways in\nwhich their own information needs change, is frequently invisible. People\noften see themselves at the end of an academic question as asking the same\n\"big dumb question\" (Linde, 1997) that they asked going in, without recognizing\nthat the constitution of the question has thoroughly changed through its\nadaptation to their relevant information and social worlds.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>Thirty-eight research scientists and students were interviewed for a\nlarge information infrastructure building project over a three year period.\nThe goal of these individual interviews and focus groups was to learn more\nabout information finding behaviors of research scientists and students\nas well as exploring their use of information systems. In line with established\nresearch findings in user studies of information retrieval, most of the\nsenior-level respondents did not often use formalized information systems\n(Taylor, 1991; Garvey and Griffith, 1980, Pinelli, 1991). These researchers\ngot the information they needed through an entire suite of other information\nseeking activities, such that they rarely found themselves going out and\nsearching for anything. It was often difficult for these people to describe\nhow they had access to items that they needed, these were simply ready\nto hand and a part of their immediate environment- transparent.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>The means for making this information readily available is the stuff\nof one's location at a particular point in the academic trajectory. It\ninvolves insider, membership status in an academic community- the fact\nof having been through the apprenticeship process. In this process, one\nbecomes attached to the installed base or the extant infrastructure of\nacademia. For example, membership in academia requires conference attendance,\nan amount of discussion with colleagues, membership in various professional\norganizations. One publishes in certain key journals and tracks career\npaths through key institutions. In the digital library interviews, those\nwho had become professors had had to fulfill the taken for granted criteria\n(a specified number of classes, exams passed, thesis completed). This necessitated\nlearning the map of the field, including salient research areas, acceptable\nmethods and methodologies, and proper vocabulary. They had to identify\na research area of interest and learn what in the field was relevant and\nimportant, and so on. Collaborations, friendships, peers and colleagues\nall add to the size and strength of the student's growing social network.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>With full membership, the professors information world takes shape through\nthe convergence of information artifacts and social world membership and\npractices. Library services copy and send on needed articles; on-line archives\nsend automatic reminders of new work in the field. In our study, the professors\nreviewed articles as well wrote them; often they had become journal editors.\nFurther along the career trajectory, they had participated in professional\ngoverning bodies or perhaps served in a funding agency to shape future\nresearch trends.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>Through all of these levels of involvement, channels were established\nalong which information flowed. All of these processes of professionalization\nand socialization into a social world enabled the convergence with information\nartifacts. The workings of the profession into which academics enter solidly\nembeds them in a community of exchange of information which happens (and\nis expected to happen) on both formal and informal levels. In most ways,\nknowing many members of one's research community and talking to them frequently\nis more important than reading professional journals (Garvey and Griffith,\n1971; Crane, 1972; Wolek and Griffith, 1980). Many respondents emphasized\nthat the idea is to know what will be in the journals before they are released.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>Throughout their careers as students and in the process of becoming\nprofessional, researchers focus their interests, which are represented\nin collegial networks, in the piles and files of papers kept, in research\ngroups, and in journal publications. Thus people set up the means, artifacts,\nand processes that were necessary for social world/information convergence.\nThe further one travels in the career line and into the more specialized\nreaches of an academic specialty, the more intense the convergence becomes.\nAs Latour (1987) notes:\n\n<P>There is a direct relationship between the size of the outside recruitment\nof resources and the amount of work that can be done on the inside....an\nisolated specialist is a contradiction in terms. Either you are isolated\nand very quickly stop being a specialist, or you remain a specialist but\nthis means you are not isolated. (p. 152)\n\n<P>This mutual reinforcement and the seeming seamlessness of the webs of\nattachments of many researchers can also be their \"Achilles' Heel.\" One\nresearcher pointed out that she did indeed rely almost entirely on her\nnetwork of contacts and subscriptions, and if those resources had holes\nin than she would probably never know it. Reliance can become total (Swanson,\n1986). In this way, too tight a convergence becomes over-determination;\nit becomes a rut that cannot be broken free of. Overly tight coupling between\na social world and its information artifacts can be seen as a powerful\nroutine that closes off other possibilities of finding information or using\nthe imagination because they are not part of the routine. Bates (1979)\ndescribes how these over-trodden paths of thinking can be broken specifically\nfor finding information. Campbell\u2019s essay on the \"fish-scale\" approach\nto interdisciplinary knowledge also intuits the value of partial overlaps\nand a looser coupling between social worlds and information (Campbell,\n1969).\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>For the individual, while convergence can produce transparency and ease\nof use, the opposite often occurs. This frequently is the experience of\nnewcomers to a social world, or those for whom the formal information systems\nfail to convergence with the criteria of membership. This results in fracture\nand frustration- a plight often felt by undergraduates. This person often\nhas no clear academic home, she may not even have a \"major\" field of study.\nShe does not know which the pertinent journals are, who the main people\nare, nor even the language to use to learn these things. As we were told\nin focus groups about what undergraduate's information needs are, \"I just\nneed five references. Any five references. I want to get those as quickly\nand as painlessly as possible.\" It does not matter who wrote the article,\nwhen, or why. This situation is less one of apathy than one that is typical\nof many undergraduates' relationship to the field of study. Those markers\nand the community gestalt which define quality, relevance, and usefulness\nare absent and thus irrelevant. If the new scholar learns and becomes a\nmember of a particular community through participation, as described above,\nthese community standards and needs become their own and at the same time\nbecome attainable and sensible and eventually, transparent.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>As Lave and Wenger (1992) describe, \"learning the ropes\" of a new community\nrequires what they call legitimate peripheral participation. This is not\nonly, or even primarily obtained through watching, but through gradually\nbeing made a fully participating member of a community through experience.\nIn this way a new member comes to know what being an insider in that community\nis all about. The academic system is structured ideally to provide that\nspace to participate and learn for incoming students: to cause a convergence\nbetween the student's developing academic, social, and artifactual worlds\nand available information worlds. In practice, of course, as Lave and Wenger\n(1992) and Eckert (1989) point out, the ideal is often not realized. Learning,\nor information acquisition, are treated as if membership were not an important\nfactor, or as if students were not juggling multiple complex memberships.\nThe trajectory to convergence, when traveled, is rarely smooth.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>We will now turn to a second example of convergence, from the point\nof view of a community of nurses. In this example, we will see the same\nfeedback process occurring through which the nursing profession, by attempting\nto integrate into the professional world of medicine is shaping and being\nshaped by the information world it is becoming part of.\n\n<P><I>&nbsp;</I>\n<LI>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Helvetica,Arial\"><FONT SIZE=+1>Community and Convergence:\nCrafting and Aligning Information Systems with Community Practices</FONT></FONT></B></LI>\n\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\"><I>I attended the American Nursing\nAssociation Database Steering Committee in June and a recommendation coming\nout of that meeting and I'm assuming making its way through the ANA channels\nis that ANA needs to put forth a major lobbying effort towards nursing\nrepresentation at the National Committee on Health and Vital Statistics.\nThe ANA has spent too many efforts on CPT </I>[Current Procedural Terminology,\nused for encoding billable procedures]<FONT COLOR=\"#0000FF\"> </FONT><I>when\nit is clear (at least to me) that NCHVS is where the lobbying efforts should\nbe focused so that nursing procedures can eventually be included in the\nprocedures section.

NIC's developers argue that nursing\nhas traditionally been literally `anomic' (without laws): in the sense\nthat no body of knowledge has been built up which can be moved from place\nto place (cf. Turnbull, 1997 and Latour, 1987 on transporting local knowledge).\nJulius Roth (1963) makes this point with respect to tuberculosis classification:\nuntil a common classification of patient status had been introduced, no\npatient could carry a single description of their condition with themselves;\nand it was almost impossible to share information between institutions\n- to build a community or shared language for comparison purposes.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>The central argument the nursing researchers make is that they should\nbe represented in integrated hospital information systems, from which they\nare currently absent. They need this for two reasons: first to act as a\nbasis for scientifically demonstrating the value of nursing within hospitals\n(so that it can be properly `accounted for' and therefore receive proper\nfunding and recognition) and, second, to act as a basis for the development\nof nursing knowledge: \"Documentation of care with standardized classifications\nallows for the integration of research and practice\" (McCloskey, 1996:\n14). Each of these goals - institutional and scientific - aims to describe\nthe way things are; each in practice also involves the operation of a principle\nof convergence - which involves fundamental changes in nursing practice\nand accounting. Looking at this example, we will see how the information\nneeds of the nurses are fitted to the professional worlds they are trying\nto integrate with, at the same time as these worlds are themselves modifying\ninformation systems so as to represent nursing. What is at stake is the\ncreation of an information world, where the practices of nurses can be\ntransparently represented in both hospital accounting schemes and in comparative\nnursing research.\n\n<P>NIC brings many threads of nursing practice together, into one, legitimated\nform of representation. The creators of the classification have attempted\nto include the many various practitioners and specialists in nursing, as\nwell as nursing educators and students. It will no longer be enough, argue\nnursing informaticians, for nurses to act locally within the context of\ntheir home institutions. In order for a body of nursing knowledge to be\nbuilt up, they will have to act the same as other nurses in other institutions.\nWhen NIC wins the day, then they will have to perform sets of NIC interventions\nspecifically. This is further supported by the inclusion of NIC in nursing\nclassroom curricula. Thus the information tool (the classification system)\nwill change both nursing practice in the field and nursing training - the\nusers will be disciplined to both act and represent their actions in NIC\nform.\n\n<P>Further, the language of NIC will have to fit with the language of other\nsciences:\n\n<P>The most frequently focused upon language is that developed by medicine\nand the numerous natural or physical sciences that contribute to medicine's\nscientific knowledge base. This language is focused upon most frequently\nby nurses, because of medicine's long history of dominance in nursing,\nits relative specificity about physiological phenomena, its apparent measurability,\nand its familiarity. It is also valued for its social status as a scientific\nlanguage, used by a politically powerful professional group, physicians.\n(Kritek in Werely and Lang, 1988]<B>: </B>25).\n\n<P>What this has meant is that nurses have, in building their information\ninfrastructure, emulated the successful research apparatus of other disciplines.\nNursing work is deliberately made, through the classification, to be subject\nto scientific testing. The goal is on the one hand an informational one\n- to create manipulatable data by ensuring comparability between nursing\ninterventions carried out at different local sites. But on the other hand,\nand crucially for our analysis, it is at the same time an institutional\none - to make nursing 'look and feel' like other sciences (and in particular\nmedicine) so as to be able to tap the same set of accountability and accounting\ninformation practices that the other sciences have so successfully developed\nto justify their funding. They are working to make their classification\nalign with medical informatics and medical standardized languages by making\nalliances and integrating themselves in other formal medical language systems.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>The nurses promoting NIC clearly see that their classification must\nbecome integrated with the rest of medical informatics at this higher level.\nThey argue that NIC must also become a part of not only the daily practice\nof nurses, as well as nursing education, but it must also be accepted by\ndoctors and other health care professionals. They have in front of them\nthe specter of a failed classification system - one which developed without\nthe feedback from the wider setting which characterizes convergence. In\nthe case of a classification of nursing diagnoses (North American Nursing\nDiagnosis Association), \"When other professionals hear us use NANDA terms,\nthey about laugh us out of the hall because some of them [NANDA terms]\ndon't seem to be directly related to what we are talking about at all!\"\n(Interview with NIC developer, 1993).\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>Nursing interventions need to be countable in the same accounts package\nas medical interventions or pharmaceutical interventions. Nursing must\nbe described in the same ways as other activities in the medical setting:\n\n<P>Without a unified language system that is integrated into other health\ncare standard initiatives, the nursing profession will not be able to use\nthe standard language developed in collaborative health care initiatives.\nNor will the unified language be capable of being integrated with other\ndevelopments in clinical practice, reimbursement formulae, or case simulation\nmodels without a collaborative health care initiative (McCormick, 1988:\n176).\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>In general:\n\n<P>It is not enough for nurses to accurately record what they do- they\nmust record it in a language acceptable to physicians and administrators,\nand productive of a new, higher status. (Berg and Bowker, 1996).\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>The feedback process between information needs, classification schemes,\nand the wider professional communities with which nursing seeks to align,\nproduces a trajectory whose end result is both a nursing informatics that\ncan integrate with wider medical informatics and a nursing practice that\nwill be sensibly altered to permit this integration. The convergence here\nis between information tracking systems and the social worlds of practicing\nnurses -- a new kind of nursing information world, more broadly defined\nand strategically situated.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>As in the case of the individual academic discussed above, then, professional\ncommunities too find themselves struggling with transparency. Here the\nissue is not so much one of membership, but of aligning information systems\nand practice in such a way that the emerging information world is strategically\nsituated amongst other information worlds.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>The fledgling academic must achieve transparency through learning and\nprofessional socialization; the social world here achieves its transparency\nthrough a series of translations and negotiations with its neighbors. In\nneither case is the picture entirely deterministic - both the individual\nand the social world have the ability to reconfigure the world(s) that\nthey are adjusting to: particularly as they become more mature. Howard\nBecker\u2019s analysis in <U>Art Worlds</U> (1982) notes the difference between\na naive and a maverick artist as precisely constituting this relationship\nto the social world. Naive artists are not in dialogue with the reigning\nartistic conventions; mavericks play with them and subvert them. Thus we\nsaw the academic becoming a reviewer or journal editor; we can see nursing\ninformaticians developing positions of influence within the wider informatics\nfield.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>A curious erasure of the learning and negotiating process often happens\nover time. In both the individual and the community case there is frequently\na belief that all that is really happening is that the original questions\nand goals are now being served by the information worlds that they are\nnow linked with. The achievement of transparency becomes naturalized --\nthis is just how the world is. For the mature researcher, it is easy to\nforget barriers and blockages facing the newcomer; as social worlds converge\nwith wider-scale information systems, the categories come to seem entirely\nnatural, rather than negotiated (Bowker and Star, 1994; Becker, 1994).\nIn each case the operation of the feedback process of convergence has underwritten\nthe mutual fitting of a changed individual/community and a new information\nworld.\n\n<P>&nbsp;\n\n<P>In the following section, we will examine what convergence looks like\nwhen social worlds are stitched together and overlap in yet larger information\nsystems. The International Classification of Disease (ICD) was first developed\nover one hundred years ago, and today is used by such various groups as\nepidemiologists in national health institutions and individual health practitioners\nin small villages around the world.\n\n<P><I>&nbsp;</I>\n<LI>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Helvetica,Arial\"><FONT SIZE=+1>Convergence and Infrastructure:\nLinking Multiple Social Worlds with Wider Scale Information Systems</FONT></FONT></B></LI>\n\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><I><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Alain Desrosi&eacute;res (1988)\nhas shown beautifully how census breakdowns of the populations of German,\nFrance and England have remained closely tied to the history of work, trade\nunions and government intervention in those countries. We suggest that\nas the ICD \"naturally\" becomes more universally applicable, this is partly\nthe result of the hidden spread of western values through the application\nof our own bureaucratic techniques. These techniques appear rational and\ngeneral to us, but when looked at in detail prove highly contingent.</FONT></I>\n\n<P><I><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">(Bowker and Star, 1994: 202)</FONT></I>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">We will now move further out from\na focused social world, nursing, and sketch how multiple overlapping information\nworlds are generated and supported through wider scale convergence. At\nthis overview level, we are concerned with the development of very large\nscale information systems which are shared by many professions - for example\ncensus data shared by economists, policy analysts, government agencies;\nor biodiversity databases shared by environmentalists, biologists, community\ngroups and so forth. What emerges is that the same principle of mutual\nfeedback between the information artifacts and the social worlds occurs:\nthe wider collection of social worlds gets changed in just the same way\nas the individual research or the professional community did in the process\nof the development of a new information world. Transparency at this level\nbegins to merge with the very notion of infrastructure -- that which is\nready-to-hand across a wide scale of operation. Of course, it is a problematic\nnotion, given the complexity of transparencies in such heterogeneous mergers\n(Star and Ruhleder, 1996, discuss this at some length).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Convergence here fits together\nthe representation of knowledge and the phenomena which are being represented,\nthrough highly distributed knowledge systems. Consider for example job\nclassifications in Europe: there are large differences, as Desrosi&eacute;res\n(1988) points out, between \"professional\" in England, and \"cadre\" in France.\nEach classification system has been incorporated into a number of instruments\nof government (such as the census) and into a series of organizational\ndecisions (for example the organization of trade unions). Each has spawned\nits own particular varieties of statistical knowledge: epidemiologists\ntrack stress, say, by socio-professional category; sociologists structure\ntheir surveys using those same categories; government policy makers then\nadopt the findings to target specific groups. While there is no \"in principle'\"difference\nin social and political organization in England and France, two different\ninformation worlds have historically reified two incommensurable subsets\nof the population: and these subsets have <I>become</I> ever more real\nand identifiable subsets as a result of this convergence. Is stress differently\ndistributed in England and France? The question becomes virtually inseparable\nfrom the structuring of the information artifacts as well as from the practices\nof the different social worlds employing them. When they converge within\nnations, two different transparencies may emerge between countries. If\nthey are standardized across national boundaries, the transparency will\nextend further.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">To explore this relationship between\nknowledge and infrastructure further, we will turn our attention briefly\nto the International Classification of Disease, tenth edition. The ICD\nis one of a series of international classification systems that were developed\nin the late nineteenth century - these ranged from classifications of labor\nto freight packages to ears. (The shape of ears, originally thought to\nbe linked to types and degrees of criminality, became enshrined in the\nclassification of people in the collection of vital statistics and immigration.)\nEach scheme involved the creation of a new international governing bodies\ntogether with the development of an information world in which those bodies\ncould work. And many of the new classifications became strongly entrenched\nin information gathering practices - for example, Bertillon's classification\nof ears is still today the basis for the 'three quarter' photograph displayed\non US green cards.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">In the case of the ICD, the series\nof overlapping communities that needed access to the same information world\n(in order to co-ordinate their own professional activities) included -\nbut was by no means restricted to - the following:</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\"><I>Epidemiologists</I> -- who\nneeded comparable data on diseases in different countries in order to discern\npatterns in outbreaks and thence deduce causes;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\"><I>Public health officials --\n</I>who needed to be able to patrol the boundaries of the nation and keep\nout infectious immigrants; as well as monitor health conditions at home;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\"><I>Health insurance companies\n--</I> who needed to be able to file data on diseases using doctors for\ninformation collection purposes (and so needing to use a classification\nsystem that doctors would understand)</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\"><I>Census officials </I>-- who\nneeded to create comparable international data sets in order to serve the\nneeds of the multiple professions that drew on the census.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">No one of these communities had\npriority in the development of the ICD.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">To the contrary, the final classification\nas it has developed has entrenched flaws from every perspective. Let us\nconsider two examples. First is the number of diseases that are coded for.\nIn order to get doctors (or, in outlying areas, lay personnel) to fill\nin death certificates using the code, there must be a restricted number\nof disease categories. This feature of medical practice is a blight for\nepidemiologists, for whom a nuance in a particular classification might\nwell make a large difference in the context of a specific inquiry. Through\nthis case, however, we can see the operation of the same principle of convergence\nthat we have observed above. Over the past 100 years, doctors have been\ntrained in medical school into use of the ICD throughout their practice\n- they use it in accounting forms, personal histories and death certificates.\nThey have fitted their practice so that they can support the use of a developing\nICD (which has grown consistently in scope and size and so become more\nepidemiologically useful). Our second example is the use of the ICD in\nthe Third World. There is frequently a complaint in developing countries\nthat the ICD is not relevant to their interests - when people are dying\nbefore they can be `accurately' diagnosed, what purpose is there in propagating\nthe system, they ask. They argue that the ICD does not represent their\nown diseases. Against this view runs the Foucaldian (1991) observation\nthat it is precisely the ability of governments to count people, things,\ndiseases which is a feature of recent \"development.\"</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">The key point for us is that as\nthe ICD gains a representational foothold in developing countries so at\nthe same time (and in pace) does Western medical practice, which itself\nis tied to the ICD; and so ultimately does the ICD become the most apt\ndescriptor of disease. The disciplining of representational practice onto\na single classification scheme is tied directly to the spread of allopathic\nmedicine - and where allopathic medicine is fully practiced, the ICD provides\nthe best description of diseases. A continuing problem for the WHO comes\nin trying to integrate traditional systems of medicine -- for example,\nacupuncture has no category of disease per se, but a model of imbalances\nof forces in the body. It is extremely difficult to map the one onto the\nother in any simple sense without violating someone\u2019s ontology. The ICD\ncomes as a package. It would be a mistake to see it as 'just' a classification\nsystem that can be applied to as is to the Third World: it marks the convergence\nof a social world and an extended system of information artifacts, including\ndeath certificates, software, and the epidemiological record keeping of\nthe WHO.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Thus the development of the ICD\ncan be seen as the mutual inter-adjustment of multiple information worlds\nin tune with the mutual inter-adjustment of multiple social worlds. Given\nthe complexity of the processes involved, the resultant large scale information\ninfrastructure is of course not seamless. However, it operates as efficiently\nand reliably as it doubtless does precisely because of the continual feedback\nprocess of convergence. In the case of large scale infrastructure, attachment\nto the installed base, affiliation with multiple communities, and compatibility\nwith other systems of knowledge is necessary for success (Star and Ruhleder,\n1996). As Bowker and Star (1994) have pointed out, the ICD's success, as\nseen by its almost universal adaptation and use, is based as much on the\ngeneral westernization, industrialization, and bureaucratization of the\nworld as the classification itself. The ICD is a central point in an international\nsystem of interlocking classifications and standardized medical languages\nas well as a key structuring agent in medical linguistics generally.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n<LI>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Helvetica,Arial\"><FONT SIZE=+1>The Ontological Status of\nConvergence</FONT></FONT></B></LI>\n\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">We have looked briefly at three\nexamples of convergence, from the perspective of the individual and information\nretrieval, a professional social world and its codification practices,\nand large scale information infrastructure involving multiple social worlds.\nWe have witnessed some similar processes in each case, mediated by developing\ninformation infrastructure: the world comes to look as if the convergent\ndescription of it is accurate, and \"natural.\" The degree of transparency\nachieved in each case depends on location, strategy and politics. As one\nscales up, transparency becomes more subject to contention arising from\nthe heterogeneity of the participating social worlds; once achieved, it\nacquires considerable inertia and even coercive power. This finding is\nakin to Star's handling of anomalies in <U>Regions of the Mind</U> (1989)\nand Latour's analysis of scientific networks in <U>Science in Action</U>\n(1987), and at the level of large scale control, with Foucault\u2019s original\nsense of discipline.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">At the same time, the co-creation\naspect of convergence is central to our argument here -- while transparency\nmay seem wholly natural, it is never inevitable or universal. In this we\nfollow Yates and Orlikowski\u2019s use of Giddens\u2019 structuration model: structure\nand agency are dialectical co-creations (Yates, 1989; Orlikowski, 1991;\nOrlikowski and Yates, 1994; Davies and Mitchell 1994 use a similar approach).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">There is another powerful sociological\ntradition that has looked at similar processes as a fundamental to social\nstability: the functionalist tradition. For the purposes of dealing with\nthe intertwining of information and social worlds, we can trace this tradition\nback to the path-breaking essay by Durkheim and Mauss (1963) through Evans-Pritchard\nto Mary Douglas' own innovative (1986) work on `how institutions think'.\nDurkheim and Mauss argued that at the root of primitive classifications\nis a classification of social relationships: these are then projected onto\nthe world at large and read back into social discourse through the intermediary\nof myth. Thus for Durkheim and Mauss it is not surprising that stories\nabout stars, the coyote, the origin of fire, and so on `converge' on the\nsame moral: since they are in fact the same social story told in different\n`registers' (to borrow Levi-Strauss' (1973) phrase).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Mary Douglas (1986) felt no qualms\nabout bringing the lessons of Durkheim and Mauss right into the center\nof our own social organization of information. Her position is simply that:\n\"How a system of knowledge gets off the ground is the same as the problem\nof how any collective good is created\" (45). Social institutions, she explains,\nare about reducing entropy, and:</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">the incipient institution needs\nsome stabilizing principle to stop its premature demise. That stabilizing\nprinciple is the naturalization of social classifications. There needs\nto be an analogy by which the formal structure of a crucial set of social\nrelations is found in the physical world, or in the supernatural world,\nor in eternity, anywhere, so long as it is not seen as a socially contrived\narrangement. When the analogy is applied back and forth from one set of\nsocial relations to another, and from these back to nature, its recurring\nformal structure becomes easily recognized and endowed with self-validating\ntruth. (48).5</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Douglas is at her strongest when\nshe unflinchingly argues that basic classificatory judgments are social\nin the sense that they are created, maintained and policed by institutions:\n\"Nothing else but institutions can define sameness. Similarity is an institution\"\n(55). The relevance of her position in our discussion of convergence is\nclear: she is adopting the position - close to our own - that the development\nof a single information world in any particular setting is not about the\nenlightened discovery of the truth about the world but is rather a statement\nabout the consolidation of social institutions and information systems.\nFor us, it is this consolidation which explains some people's transparent\nuse of information infrastructure, and others' inability or lack of desire\nto do so.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Where Douglas, like Durkheim and\nMauss, is weak is that she reifies `the social\u2019 and sets it apart from\ntechnology (or information systems). She falls prey to Latour's (1993)\narguments against all great divides which engender determinism. On the\none hand, she defines society as apart from the existence of things-in-the-world;\nbut then for a causal argument, she has trouble setting `society' as determinant\non the one side of an equation and `the world' or `knowledge\u2019 on the other.\nThere has never been room for co-construction in this form of functionalist\nargument. A related weakness is that, as with many functionalist positions,\nshe makes stability too much the norm. What needs explaining is not only\ninformation convergence within a pocket of stability but also the lack\nof convergence (and the preservation of an outsider status) within multiple\noverlapping institutions. As sociologist Everett Hughes<B> </B>reminds\nus, we need always to keep in mind that \"it might have been otherwise.\"\nBehind functionalism is the position that we all belong to one professional\nworld, one social class, one ethnicity and so forth - and that the alignment\nof these memberships into a coherent social institution acts as unproblematic\nguarantor for information convergence and thus transparency. Those for\nwhom this knowledge is not transparent are deviants. (Illustrative of this\npoint is functionalist sociologist Robert Merton\u2019s categorization of scientific\ndiscovery (novelty) <I>as </I>a form of deviance! (1973))</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">For all these criticisms, our\nunderstanding of convergence is enhanced by Durkheim, Mauss, and Douglas'\nwork. It reminds us that convergence is a result of the consolidation of\nsocial institutions. The information science literature also lends studies\nof the multiple paths and means that information converges along- such\nas colleague networks, personal collections, community practices (cf. Lancaster,\n1995; Bishop and Star, 1996; Pinelli, 1991; Aloni, 1985; Garvey and Griffith,\n1980). Network analyses have shown the importance of interconnections (Haythornthwaite,\n1996; Wasserman, 1994; Scott, 1992), and the actor network perspective\n(Latour, 1993; Callon, 1989; Latour, 1987; Callon, Law, Rip, 1986) has\ndemonstrated the importance of linking the non-humans to the previously\nhuman centered networks. To these, we are adding that convergence is a\nprocess in which status, cultural and community practices, resources, experience,\nand information infrastructure work together to produce transparency within\nan information world. Convergence is fully situated and is not universal,\nnor is it exclusive. In times of change, it also has a certain fragility.\nIt is a situation, for the most part, of privilege.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">From a conservative point of view,\nsuch \"obviousness\" or naturalness would mean successful integration with\nthe normative structure of social life. We do not wish to recapitulate\nthe recent history of American sociology -- people belong to many communities\nof practice, and participate in many information worlds. Success is relative\nand partial. For any given information world, the degree of convergence\nis not a matter of \"proper\" socialization or internalization of the correct\nnorms. Rather, people balance conflicting requirements from different information\nworlds; they may have good reasons (such as more important memberships)\nfor NOT undertaking pathways to membership or convergence (Becker, 1967);\nor they may be excluded on other grounds such as gender, age or race. So\nthe situation of transparent, obvious, easy information retrieval on a\nroutine basis for work and play is in some ways a special case, and in\nany event, in pure form is an analytic exercise.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n<OL>\n<LI>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Helvetica,Arial\">Conceptualizing Lack of Convergence</FONT></B></LI>\n</OL>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\"><FONT SIZE=+1>&nbsp;</FONT></FONT></B>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Because social worlds and information\nartifacts often do <I>not </I>converge, it is important to conceptualize\nfailures of transparency as well as the successful formation of information\nworlds. Again, turning to the foundational work of Durkheim in sociology,\nthe term \"anomie\" seems suggestive of those situations where there is a\nfailure to converge.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Anomie in common parlance is thought\nto mean something like \"at loose ends.\" The Oxford English Dictionary lists\na range of definitions, beginning with a disregard of divine law, through\nthe 19th and 20th century sociological terms meaning an absence of accepted\nsocial standards or values. Most sociologists associate the term with Durkheim,\nwho used the concept to speak of the ways in which an individual's actions\nare matched, or integrated, with a system of social norms and practices.\nIn his famous <U>Suicide</U> (1897), Durkheim accounts for the lower suicide\nrate among Catholics by noting the stricter, more binding and more clearly\nspecified sets of norms and practices affecting individuals, by contrast\nwith Protestants. When such a map for behavior is present, he argued, the\nperson is less likely to experience the angst of normlessness, less likely\nto internalize a situation with no structure, and therefore less likely\nto kill themselves. Durkheim\u2019s work has been widely criticized on empirical\nand methodological grounds. As well, we have the same criticisms of the\nfunctionalist notion of mismatch as of convergence.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">At the same time, the word does\ncapture the sense of what happens with a profound mismatch between social\nworld and information artifacts. Certainly the dispirited undergraduates\nwe interviewed about library usage were experiencing anomie in the commonsense\nmeaning -- at loose ends.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Durkheim also formally posited\nanomie as a mismatch, not simply as the absence of norms. Thus, a society\nwith too <U>much</U> rigidity and little individual discretion could also\nproduce a kind of anomie, a mismatch between individual circumstances and\nlarger social mores. Thus, fatalistic suicide arises when a person is too\nrule-governed, when there is, in the words of Ricoeur (1988), no free horizon\nof expectation.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Information anomie may arise when\nthere is an absence of social standards, guidance or values -- accepted\nas useful by those successfully working with the system. It may also arise\nwhen the system is <I>overly</I> rigid, allowing for no tailoring or customizing\nto individual needs in a place of practice.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">The term anomie can carry a lot\nof undesirable historical freight, such as the notion that there is one\nright system and anomie is a deviant falling away from that perfect recipe;\nsimilarly, the notion that there are \"good users\" and \"bad users,\" the\nlatter of which are anomic (or deviant). Again, we do not wish to over\nemphasize any centralized, too- rational or functional a priori visions\nof any given system. Rather, the emphasis here is on the notion of mismatch,\na lack of convergence and on the senses of frustration, being lost, even\ndesperation which may result when there are mismatches between a system\nand those who work with it. At higher levels of scale, it may mean the\nexclusion or invisibility of whole social worlds or classes of people --\ninstitutionalized opacity, rather than transparency (Star and Strauss,\nin press).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n<LI>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Helvetica,Arial\"><FONT SIZE=+1>Related Work in Library and\nInformation Science</FONT></FONT></B></LI>\n\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Library and information science\nresearch has dealt with most of the components or itemized examinations\nof the contents of the information worlds to which we are referring. Descriptions\nof how these components work together, and analysis of longer term interaction\nof information resources and social worlds is becoming more important in\nthe field, as social informatics emerges as an increasingly important area.\nIn this section, we will describe how our model of convergence can be used\nto situate the social informatics dimension of LIS research.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Many important studies in this\nfield are centered on items such as libraries, journals, and other formal\ninformation systems. They are grounded in a model of a \"user\" first conceiving\nof an information need, then going out and getting that information (Lancaster,\n1995; Bates, 1989). The role of the information scientist (or intermediary)\nis in between those two points, interpreting the information need, creating\nand utilizing document surrogates, using or building a system to go and\nretrieve an item that will satisfy the user's need for information. While\nbringing attention to the often overlooked role of the user, research usually\nquestions the circumstances influencing the utility and effectiveness of\ndifferent forms of document and system use, representation, and retrieval\nunder different circumstances (Covi, 1996, Bates, 1989).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">The view these studies take is\noften segmented along different axes, such as exploring the use of specific\ndocument forms, or the use of single systems among particular communities\n(Lancaster, 1995; Baym, 1995; Pinelli, 1991; Bizot, Smith, and Hill, 1991;\nAloni, 1985; Warden, 1981; Crane, 1972; and others.) Covi (1996, in press)\ncritiques the more segmented view as a \"closed rational, or bounded database\nperspective.\" Specifically, she defines this as a perspective that reviews\nthe use of a system as if that system were not situated in other resources\non and off- line as well as community norms and other social practices.\nShe calls for more use of the open and naturalistic inquiry which has recently\nbegun to appear. This integrated, naturalistic view as a departure for\nLIS research is less common, although growing in interest and importance\nin the LIS community (Bishop and Star, 1996).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">We seek in the model presented\nin this paper to include and add to the scope and perspective of current\nunderstanding of information use. Indeed, they are complementary and supportive\nto what we are saying; for example, the many studies that have demonstrated\nthe importance of colleague interaction for information exchange (Lancaster,\n1995; Garvey and Griffith, 1980; Crane, 1972; Wolek and Griffith, 1980).\nOthers point to the significance of personal collections and resources\n(Soper, 1976, Chatman, 1991, 1992). Also, the importance of physical proximity\nin use of resources has been well documented for some time (Waples, 1932,\nHertz and Rubenstein, 1954; Rosenberg, 1966; Palmer, 1981; Pinelli, 1991;\nGould and Pearce, 1991). All of these point to the importance of and describe\nthe significance of various elements in information worlds, which we are\nthen drawing together.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Further complementary research\nis found in the strong tradition of studies of communication patterns examining\nthe social networks of individuals. This particular thread of social network\nanalysis \"is an approach and set of techniques used to study the exchange\nof resources among actors\" (Haythornthwaite, 1996: 1). It traces exchanges\nbetween actors and finds patterns of relationships of exchange. These relationships\nare synthesized into networks. These networks can be examined for patterns\nof exchange of information. Relationships between \"nodes\" are measured\nand evaluated for several properties, including strength, intensity, direction,\nand content (Wasserman, 1994; Scott, 1992). Hesse, Sproull, Kiesler and\nWellman have all indicated how computer and social networks interpenetrate\nin creating these relationships (Hesse, et al., 1993; Finholt and Sproull,\n1990; Sproull and Kiesler, 1991). The development of the strength of these\nties points to the communicative processes associated with convergence;\nfurther research into the similarities and differences between social networks\nand social worlds would further specify these links.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">The advent of very wide scale\nnetworked information systems has opened many new discussions about communities\nand information. The possibility of information acquisition, retrieval,\nand tailoring at the community level (including finding communities on\nthe Internet, designing for support for communities rather than individuals)\nis an exciting one. Its success depends in part on the ability to design\nto, and account for, the multiple levels discussed here. Not surprisingly,\nwe know the most about the individual level of information retrieval, access,\nand use; some about the community or occupational level, particularly in\nthe areas of scientific communication; and we are just beginning to learn\nabout infrastructural convergence as a problem in design. Hanseth and Monteiro\n(1996; Hanseth, 1996; Hanseth, Monteiro and Hatling, 1996) have begun a\nseries of investigations into information infrastructure and standardization\nthat addresses many of these issues. They argue in particular that the\ntensions between standardization and flexibility in the creation of information\ninfrastructure is a key design factor, and that analysis of institutions\nsupporting the creations of standards and standardized classifications\nis key to successful design in the networked computing environment. This\npoint receives support in Bowker and Star (1994; <B>1997</B>) and Star\nand Ruhleder (1996).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Our goal is to tie these many\nfactors together into a holistic and dynamic model. As other researchers\n(Bates, 1989; Covi, 1996, Covi and Kling, in press) have pointed out, search\nand retrieval as a model is too simplistic, rational, and mechanical to\ndescribe the dynamics of how people, groups, infrastructure come together\nas resources. They are calling for study of the use of digital libraries\nin terms of open natural systems and a social world perspective; looking\nnot only at the use of the system in terms of a bounded world and rational\nactors, but rather at the physical and temporal workplace, the professional\nfield, and the occupational niche of the user (Covi, 1996; Covi and Kling,\nin press). To this we are adding the idea that not only are these variables\ncrucial in understanding the use and usability of digital library systems\nor other information systems, but also the amount of convergence or the\nlack of convergence a person, community, or multiple communities are experiencing.\nWe are concerned not with cataloging the contents of information worlds\nor with describing use of individual units therein, but rather how all\nof these interact dynamically.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">But in addition, we are also sketching\nout a larger framework. Search and retrieval are not compartmentalized\ntasks, but rather, are products of social processes and relationships.\nHow an individual or a community or multiple communities are linked is\nthe result of the situatedness of each. Information is not a static product\nthat is \"out there\" waiting to be found, but is rather a construct of particular\nsituations at specific points in time. Convergence is a process by which\nthings come together through social process such as socialization into\na profession or the formation of a community with the co-construction of\ninformation artifacts at different levels of scale.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n<LI>\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Helvetica,Arial\"><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion</FONT></FONT></B></LI>\n</OL>\n<FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">We know that there is no universal\nscheme by which information may be made easily available to everyone. Some\nsystems of information organization are widely adopted, such as that of\nthe Library of Congress or the telephone book. However, as Berman (1981)\nillustrates for the Library of Congress Subject Headings, these same headings\nmay carry with them systematic exclusions of points of view of ethnic minorities;\nthey overemphasize Western religions and do not well represent common names\nfor everyday objects. Similar points hold for other attempts to organize\nand classify the world of knowledge. Current attempts to catalogue and\nclassify the chaos of the internet come nowhere near a universal organizational\nscheme; if anything, they are proliferating towards \"islands of indexing,\"\ndespite powerful search engines and limitless hypertext.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Rather than perceive this state\nof affairs nihilistically, we have in this paper seen it as an opportunity\nto understand something about the relationship between people, history,\ninformation, and material and social order. While it is true that no one\nscheme has yet worked for everyone, some schemes work reasonably well for\nmany people at particular times. If not absolute, there is sometimes relative\ntransparency at all levels of scale. In our work, studying designers and\nusers of information, we see \"clear and present differences\" between people\nwho are very comfortable within some world of information, who are \"plugged\nin\" to a range of sources and are able to find all the information they\nneed easily; and those who are intimidated, confused, and limited by their\nrelationships to that same information. The differences are subtle, and\nto some degree are hidden by models of individual user needs and concepts\nsuch as levels of expertise (as transparency unmodified by time or place).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">This has given us some insight\ninto the locale of those on the outside, those experiencing a gap between\ntheir social world\u2019s practices and formal information systems. These differences\nbetween insiders and outsiders are neither trivial nor easily understood.\nSometimes there are differences in career stage which explain relative\nease and familiarity - an old hand will more likely move easily through\na world of information than a novice, as we have noted. But not always,\nif that world itself is shifting and changing rapidly, and training situations\nfavor students over professors. Sometimes there are insider/outsider differences\nof the sort noted by Berman - systematic exclusions of members of a certain\ngroup, or such differences in access to materials and infrastructure that\nsomething like a digital library is a current impossibility. Sometimes\nother memberships are more salient (Eckert, 1989).</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">The greatest issue for the creation\nof information systems is that these processes are invisible to traditional\nrequirements analysis; they can only be seen through the developmental\nanalysis of information worlds. Convergence often masquerades as naturalness.\nIt is not, but is rather the result of a particular configuration of relationships\nbetween information and social order. Convergence is not interoperability,\nbut rather a layering up of solutions and conventions, and standards. Usability\nis an emergent property which is not currently addressed in this fashion.\nThe reason why some things are obvious to some people and not to others\nhas to do with the connectedness that some people and not others experience\nand the memberships that some have and not others.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">The challenge in understanding\nand recognizing these differences is to design to them. This does not mean\ncreating \"simple\" versus \"complex\" interfaces to systems, but rather recognizing\nthe fundamentally different processes of searching and use germane to different\ninformation worlds. Recognizing differences in needs implies building systems\nthat actually do different things. Unfortunately, many systems today do\nnot and often cannot take these different needs into account. The new relationships\nand points of access being built and developed now benefit only a small\ngroup of people at a particular place in their careers. Systems are now\nbeing linked with hopes of interoperability without taking into account\nthe trajectories of information on a systemic or infrastructural level.\nMore than ever, the need for interdisciplinary teams for design and use\nare called for to addressed the multifaceted nature of information -- a\nsocial informatics.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">&nbsp;</FONT>\n\n<P><B><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">References:</FONT></B>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Allison, Paul D. and Scott Long.\n1990. \"Departmental effects on scientific productivity.\" <I>American Sociological\nReview </I>55: 469-479.</FONT>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"New York,Times New Roman\">Aloni, Michaela.
