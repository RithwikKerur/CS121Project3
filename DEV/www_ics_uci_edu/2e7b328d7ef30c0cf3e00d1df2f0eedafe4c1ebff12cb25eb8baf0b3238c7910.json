The following list gives some\ntransitional phrases and their typical uses.\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b> and, or, nor, also, moreover, furthermore, indeed, in fact,\nfirst, second, third, in addition.</b>\n<ul>\nUse to add another thought.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nfor instance, for example, for one thing, similarly, likewise.</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for adding, illustrating, or expanding a point.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\ntherefore, thus, so, and so, hence, consequently, finally, on the\nwhole, all in all, in other words, in short.</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for adding up consequences, summarizing minor points to emphasize\na major point.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nfrequently, occasionally, in particular, in general, specifically,\nespecially, usually, often.\n</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for adding a qualifying point or illustration.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nof course, no doubt, doubtless, to be sure, granted, certainly.\n</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for conceding a point to the opposition, or recognizing a point\njust off the main line.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nbut, however, yet, on the contrary, not at all, surely, no, until.\n</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for reversing or deflecting the line of thought, usually back to your\nown side.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nstill, nevertheless, notwithstanding.\n</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for returning the thought to your side after a concession.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nalthough, though, whereas.\n</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for attaching a concession.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nbecause, since, for.\n</b>\n<ul>\nUsed to connect a reason to an assertion.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nif, provided, in case, unless, lest, when.\n</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for qualifying and restricting a more general idea.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nas if, as though, even if.\n</b>\n<ul>\nUsed for glancing at tentative or hypothetical conditions that\nstrengthen and clarify your point.\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>\nthis, that, these, those, who, whom, he, she, it, they, all of them,\nfew, many, most, several.\n</b>\n<ul>\nRelative and demonstrative words, like adjectives and pronouns, tie\nthings together, pointing back as they carry the reference ahead.\nBut be sure there is no mistaking the specific word to which each\nrefers.\n</ul>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n<h2>Gaining Coherence</h2>\n<p>\nOne can gain coherence in writing by using the following:\n<ol>\n<li>\nfilling in with thought,\n<li>\nfilling in with specific illustrative detail,\n<li>\nusing transitional tags (see above) that tie sentences together,\n<li>\nrepeating words or syntactical patterns.\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n<h2>Sentence Starts</h2>\n<p>\nAs a rule of thumb, 60% of all sentences should start with the subject\nof that sentence.\nTo avoid monotony the other 40% should start with one of the\nfollowing:\n<ol>\n<li>\nprepositional phrase,\n<li>\nparenthetical element,\n<li>\nan infinitive (e.g., To begin with, ...),\n<li>\nadverbs, which modify a sentence (but don't use \"hopefully\" in this\nway),\n<li>\na subordinating conjunction,\n<li>\nparticipial phrase (but make sure it modifies the right word),\n</ol>\n\n<P>\n<hr>\n<p>\nThe above\nwords are my recording of some of the advise from the late Dr. Tiemersma,\nCalvin College,\nwho taught me how to write.\n\n<P>\n<b> \nCopyright &#169 1997, by \n<a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/goodrich/\">\nGoodrich</a>.\n</b>\n\n</body>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
