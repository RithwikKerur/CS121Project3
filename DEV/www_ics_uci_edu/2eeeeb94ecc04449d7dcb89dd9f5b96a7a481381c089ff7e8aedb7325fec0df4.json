Version: 1.7 or greater is required.\"</b>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Workaround</b>: Go the the following \r\n<a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html\">Java Website</a> and download an install the <b>Mac OS X x64</b>\r\nsofware: the download is named <b>jdk-6u67-macosx-x64.dmg</b> which shows as\r\nabout 186 MB.\r\nAfter doing this, if you still get the same error message when starting Eclipse,\r\n  delete Eclipse, redownload it, and reinstall it.\r\n<p>\r\n<li><b>Problem</b>: Eclipse cannot locate the JRE.\r\nThe following error message will appear when Eclipse starts.\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"images/troubleshooting/nojre.jpg\">\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Workaround</b>: You need to manually set the <b>PATH</b> system variable\r\n      to include the location of your JRE.\r\n    Normally Eclipse does this automatically.\r\n    Before following the instructions below, find the directory that contains\r\n      <b>Java</b>.\r\n<p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Click the <b>Start</b> button\r\n<li>Click <b>Control Panel</b> entry (on the upper right)\r\n<li>Click the <b>System</b> text/icon (near the end: they are alphabetical)\r\n<li>Click the <b>Advance System Settings</b> shield (upper left)\r\n<li>On the <b>System Properties</b> pop-up window select the <b>Advanced</b> tab\r\n      (it is probably already selected) and click the\r\n      <b>Environmental Variables...</b> button.\r\n<li>In the <b>Environmental Variables</b> pop-up window select <b>PATH</b>\r\n      under <b>Variable</b> in the top pane (it is probably already selected)\r\n      and click the <b>Edit</b> for that pane.\r\n<li>In the <b>Edit User Variable</b> pop-up window, the <b>Variable name:</b>\r\n      text box should show <b>PATH</b> and the <b>Variable value:</b> text\r\n      box should show the current value of <b>PATH</b>, which may be too big\r\n      to fit on the screen.\r\n<li>Put the cursor at the end of the  <b>Variable value:</b> text box and\r\n      type a semicolon and the path to the <b>bin</b> folder in the <b>jre7</b>\r\n      folder in the <b>Java</b> folder you found.\r\n<li>Click the various <b>OK</b> buttons in the 3 pop-up windows.\r\n</ol>\r\nIn the picture below, my <b>PATH</b> variables started with\r\n  <b>C:\\Program files</b> so I added at the end\r\n  <b>;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7\\bin</b> which is where I installed Java.\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"images/troubleshooting/path.jpg\">\r\n<p>\r\nTry running Eclipse again and see if you get the same error message; if you do,\r\n   try rebooting and running Eclipse again.\r\n<p>\r\n<li><b>Problem</b>: Eclipse cannot locate the JNI shared library.\r\nThe following error message will appear when Eclipse starts.\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"images/troubleshooting/failedjni.jpg\">\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Workaround</b>: I've been told this is often caused by installing\r\n   incompatible version of Java and Eclipse: specifically a 32-bit version\r\n   of one and a 64-bit version of the other.\r\nGo back and follow the instructions for downloading and installing Java and\r\n  Eclispe (heck, do it for Python too), ensuring you are using the 32-bit\r\n  versions of both.\r\n</ol>\r\n<!---\r\n2) right click on the eclipse shortcut and selected properties.\r\n   Change target to\r\n   C:\\Users\\Vicky\\Downloads\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe -vmargs -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true\r\n   It sets eclipse to try IP v4 protocol first, if a machine is set to use\r\n   IP v6 as default (the future protocol) there are some applications/protocol\r\n   that cannot us it.\r\n--->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
