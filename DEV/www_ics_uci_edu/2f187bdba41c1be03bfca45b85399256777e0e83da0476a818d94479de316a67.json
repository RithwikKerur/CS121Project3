But it's a good idea \nto read it again once or twice.</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>-->\n<P>\nYou may do this assignment alone, or with one partner.</P>\n<p>\n<b>The Task:</b><br />\nSimilar to the activity we did on the first day of class, write two statements that express \nlarge quantities of storage in everyday terms:</p>\n<uL>\n  \n  <LI>One statement should be of the form, \"One petabyte is the aggregate amount of disk storage on the \n  laptops of all the students who use our classroom in a quarter.&quot; [You may use petabyte, exabyte, zettabyte, or yottabyte.]</LI>\n  <LI>One statement should be of the form, &quot;The UCI registrar's photos of every UCI student in the next 50 years will take up 1.1 terabytes.&quot; [Try, unlike this example, to get a quantity that's at least half a petabyte.]</LI>\n</uL>\n<p>Both statements express equalities, so in some sense they're equivalent in form. But the first one expresses the peta-exa-zetta-yotta term in a round quantity (one exabyte; 10 zettabytes); the second expresses the real-world quantity as a round number (all the images saved in one month; the audio generated by 1000 DJs).</p>\n<p>Give a short synopsis of how you reached your figure. (For example: A typical student laptop holds 500 GB or half a terabyte. Our classroom seats about 130. There are 10 &quot;periods&quot; on MWF (starting hourly 8:00 to 5:00) and 7 on TuTh for a total of 17, assuming that the classes are full each period. That comes out to 1105 terabytes or about one Petabyte.)</p>\n<p>Try to be accurate, and cite where you got quantities that aren't obvous. But this isn't a research project; just find a plausible figure on the web and go with it.</p>\n<p><b>Reference:</b><br />\n  \u00b7 1 Bit = Binary Digit<br>\n  \u00b7 8 Bits = 1 Byte<br>\n  \u00b7 1000 Bytes = 1 Kilobyte <br>\n  \u00b7 1000 Kilobytes = 1 Megabyte <br>\n  \u00b7 1000 Megabytes = 1 Gigabyte <br>\n  \u00b7 1000 Gigabytes = 1 Terabyte <br>\n  \u00b7 1000 Terabytes = 1 Petabyte <br>\n  \u00b7 1000 Petabytes = 1 Exabyte<br>\n  \u00b7 1000 Exabytes = 1 Zettabyte <br>\n\u00b7 1000 Zettabytes = 1 Yottabyte \n<p>Why not 1024 instead of 1000? Probably the best answer is that 2% difference isn't significant for this purpose.  But while processor and memory designers work in units of 1024, the secondary storage (hard disk and solid-state disk) industry has long used 1000.\n<p>\n<b>Submitting Your Assignment</b><br />\nSubmit your assignment via Checkmate (<code>checkmate.ics.uci.edu</code>).\n\nIf you worked with a partner, only one of you should submit, and the document must have both partners' names and student ID numbers at the top. The non-submitting partner should probably be present when the work is submitted, just to verify that both names are present and the submission was successful.<HR />\n<FONT  ><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/\">David G.
