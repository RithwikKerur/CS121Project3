Goldberg, Microsoft Research</h2>\n\n<p>Computing driving directions has motivated many shortest path\nheuristics that answer queries on continental-scale networks, with tens\nof millions of intersections, in real time. The underlying algorithms\nare intuitive, but until recently there was no theoretical explanation\nof their performance. We review some of these algorithms and give the\nfirst theoretical analysis for them on a non-trivial class of\nnetworks.</p>\n\n<p>For our analysis, we introduce the notion of highway dimension.  The\nanalysis works for networks with low highway dimension and gives a\nunified explanation of algorithms' good performance. Our analysis\nexplores an unexpected relationship to VC-dimension and learning theory\nand applies the latter to graph algorithm design.</p>\n\n<p>We also propose a new algorithm that achieves a better theoretical\ntime bound and is in the spirit of labeling algorithms for approximate\nshortest paths from the distributed computing literature. Our\nexperiments show that an implementation of this algorithm is extremely\nfast in practice, validating the theoretical prediction.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Ittai Abraham, Amos Fiat, and Renato Werneck.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
