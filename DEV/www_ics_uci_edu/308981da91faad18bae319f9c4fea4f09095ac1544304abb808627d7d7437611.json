Comput.</i>, vol. 22, 1993, pp. 527-551]. The second\nresult is an improved beta for the beta-skeleton subgraph of the\nminimum weight triangulation. This result appeared in the paper \"A\nbetter subgraph of the minimum weight triangulation\" by Yang\n[<i>IPL</i>, vol. 56, 1995, pp. 255-258]. \n\n<p>During his talk, Brad will be using his new graph algorithm\nvisualization application to compute and display results from these\npapers on random graphs.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
