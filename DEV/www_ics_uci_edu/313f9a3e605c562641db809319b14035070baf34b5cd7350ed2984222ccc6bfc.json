Rosen (McGraw-Hill 1995).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <div class=section>Course Grades</div>\r\n<div class=justify>\r\nThere will be 7-8 homeworks and 7-8 quizzes.\r\nHomeworks will be given each Tuesday and scheduled the following week.\r\nQuizzes will be given every Thursday at the beginning of class.\r\nThere will be one midterm and a final.\r\nThe grading criteria for the course is:<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Homework assignments 10%<br>\r\n<li>Quizzes 40%<br>\r\n<li>Midterm 20%<br>\r\n<li>Final 30%<br>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe will drop the two lowest quiz\r\nscores and the two lowest homework scores in determining your\r\nfinal grade.\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=section>Obtaining Assistance</div>\r\nThe best way to get your questions answered is by coming\r\nto lecture, section or office hours and asking them there.\r\nIn addition, you can send email to <a href=\"mailto:6a-questions@ics.uci.edu\"><tt>6a-questions@ics.uci.edu</tt></a>\r\nwhich will automatically\r\nforward the mail to the TAs and myself.\r\nIt is generally preferable to use this email address instead of our\r\npersonal addresses because you are likely to get an answer to\r\nyour question faster if it is sent to the three of us.\r\nIf you ask a question by email which requires a lengthy response,\r\nwe are likely to ask you to come in to discuss the answer in person.\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=section>Announcements</div>\r\nClass announcements will be made in lecture and in section.\r\nImportant announcements will also be posted on the class web page.\r\nThe web page will contain the most up-to-date\r\ncourse information. Any corrections or additional explanations  for\r\nthe homework\r\nassignments will also be posted there, so please check the web page\r\noccasionally to stay up to date.\r\n<p>\r\n<a name=handouts><div class=section>Handouts</div></a>\r\nThe homework solutions  and other handouts\r\nwill be made available at the lecture or on the\r\n<a href=\"ics-6a-f2000.html\">course webpage.</a>\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=section>Homework And Quizes</div>\r\nOn each Tuesday, a new homework assignment and the solution for\r\nthe previous homework will be available after lecture.\r\nThe new homework which is distributed in a given week\r\nwill cover material covered in lecture that week and will be\r\ndue the following Tuesday.\r\nThis means that when you receive a new homework assignment,\r\nwe will not have covered all of the material in lecture\r\nnecessary to do the assignment, but will have covered\r\neverything by the end of Thursday's lecture.\r\nA quiz covering the same material will be given in\r\nclass the following Thursday (two days, after handing out the solutions).\r\n<p>\r\nYou should hand your homework in to class by 11:00 AM on Tuesday.\r\n<strong> Absolutely no homework assignments will be accepted after\r\n11:00AM </strong>.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can pick up your graded homeworks and quizes from\r\nthe distribution center which is located in the\r\nICS Trailers. The office hours for the distribution center are:<br><br>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Monday and Wednesday 1:00 - 4:00, Tuesday and Thursday, 10:00 - 10:50, 12:00 - 4:00<br>\r\n</ul>\r\nEach homework assignment and quiz will be available\r\nby the second Tuesday after it was handed in.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=section>Questions On Grading</div>\r\nIf you have a question on how any of your quizzes or homeworks were\r\ngraded, talk to the TAs, grader, or me during office hours or after section.\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=section>Collaboration</div>\r\nYou are allowed, and even encouraged, to discuss the solutions to\r\nthe homework with your fellow classmates.  However, you are required to\r\nsit down and write up your own solutions independently.\r\nIn addition, you need to write down the names of any classmates with\r\nwhom you have collaborated on a given assignment, clearly indicating\r\nthat they are your collaborators.  Copying the homework assignment of\r\nanother student is considered cheating.  Keep in mind that the homework\r\ncontributes little to your final grade in comparison to the quizzes.\r\nThus, it is very much in your own best interest to have a thorough\r\nunderstanding of the homework assignments before the quiz.\r\n<p>\r\n<div class=section>Academic Honesty</div>\r\nAll work done on quizzes, midterms and finals should be your own work.\r\nCheating on any kind of in class examination will be taken very seriously.\r\nAny such incident will result in a letter describing the incident\r\nwhich is placed in your file on campus. Depending on the severity of the\r\nincident, the resulting grade can range from an F on the particular\r\nexamination to an automatic F in the course.\r\nVery severe incidents of academic dishonesty can result in suspension or\r\nexpulsion from the university.</div><br><br></font>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n</center>\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <div id=\"footer\"><centeR>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu\">School of Information and Computer Science</A>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu\">University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3435</a>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter\">Dr. Rina Dechter</A>\n\r\n<A HREF=\"mailto:dechter_at_ics.uci.edu\">dechter at ics.uci.edu</A>\r\n\n</center></div>\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
