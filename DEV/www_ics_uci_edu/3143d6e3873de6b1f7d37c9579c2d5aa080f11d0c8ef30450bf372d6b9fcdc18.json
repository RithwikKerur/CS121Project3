Would you please elaborate, giving the argument\n&gt;behind it? What about that scenario could Derived-From and\n&gt;Content-Versio not handle/express?\n\n  I don't really think that we should be trying to standardize a policy for\nthis, as it seems a higher-level issue than basic versioning support, but\nthe idea is that I might check the same file out 3 times from the same\nserver, creating 3 virtual sessions. When I later check the file back in, I\nmay need to attach a particular update to a particular checkout operation.\nThe cookie enables this (did I get it right, Chris?).\n\n  The kind of solution that youare thinking of does not allow that kind of\ncontrol: a server could let me check out v 2.1 of /docs/misc more than\nonce, and on check in the \"Derived-from:\" header does not uniquely identify\nwhich of the 3 checkouts is being affected. This is because they would all\nshare the same \"Derived-from:\" header.\n\n   My proposal tries to make locking, version-id assignment, authorization,\nand update as orthogonal as possible. A \"LOCK\" operation declares an\nintention to write. A system like Chris's would be able to assign a final\nversion number at \"LOCK\" (check-out) time, so that the version identifier\nthat my final \"PUT\" would specify would also serve the function of a\ncookie. Access control can then determine whether I am authorized to make\nthat PUT request based on my identity, as determined by existing HTTP\nmechanisms. I want to make the detailed semantics of LOCK server-dependent,\nso that many server policies can be provided. This does have the drawback\nof introducing confusion, since LOCK is a bit of  misnomer. (would\nRESERVE/RELEASE be better?)\n\n    Having 3 operations involved for an updating operation\n(LOCK/PUT/UNLOCK) also lets client and server negotiate version identifier\nat 3 separate points in time, so that a version identifier can be assigned\nby server or client, either at the request for the resource, the update\noperation itself, or the relase of the resource. A server is always free to\nassign a version identifier to a client on any of these operations, and the\nclient is free to suggest a new version identifier, at each point,\ndependent on server approval.\n\n   Does this make Chris's point, and my proposal both a bit clearer?\n\n  -- David\n\nPS. Note that I am sending only to the two lists; this replying is getting\nme 3-5 copies of each note.\n\n--------------------------------------------+--------------------------\nDavid Durand                  <a href=\"mailto:dgd@cs.bu.edu\">dgd@cs.bu.edu</a> | david@dynamicDiagrams.com\nBoston University Computer Science          | Dynamic Diagrams\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/\">http://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/</a>    | http://dynamicDiagrams.com/\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0135.html\">Dave Long: \"An attempt at taxonomy\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0133.html\">Daniel W.
