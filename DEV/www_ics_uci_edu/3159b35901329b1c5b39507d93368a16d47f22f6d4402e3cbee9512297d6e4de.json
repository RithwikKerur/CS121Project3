Currently he has three diverse, active projects. (1) Using machine learning to analyze images of millions of galaxies and providing new insight into galactic and cosmological evolution, in collaboration with several astronomers. (2) Leading a world-class group analyzing biological networks.  We use sophisticated graph theoretic algorithms which have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of biology and disease just like the Human Genome project did 15 years ago. (3) In collaboration with NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, we are helping predict future sea level rise due to global warming, by conducting large-scale simulations of the melting of the polar ice caps.\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
