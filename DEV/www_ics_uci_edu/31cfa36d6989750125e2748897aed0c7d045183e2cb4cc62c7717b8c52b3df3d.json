Comp. and Inf. Sci., Univ. of Pennsylvania</h2>\n\n<p>The construction of evolutionary trees is a fundamental problem\nin biology. All current polynomial time methods (to our knowledge)\nare unlikely to recover the topology of the true tree from\nsequences of realistic lengths (bounded, perhaps, by 10,000\nnucleotides) for large sets of widely divergent sequences, even if\nsuch methods are known to be able to reconstruct the correct\ntopology given long enough sequences. Therefore, all current\npolynomial time methods may be incapable of addressing difficult\nand important data sets such as the Tree of Life. We address this\nproblem and present a new polynomial time algorithm for\nreconstructing evolutionary trees called the Short Quartets Method.\nOur method computes topologies of subtrees induced by \"short\"\nquartets, which avoid the problematic influence of pairs of widely\ndivergent sequences. We reconstruct a tree on the entire set of\nsequences from these inferred subtrees when they are compatible. We\ndescribe a simple implementation and study its convergence rate for\nthe Cavender-Farris model of evolution. Our analytical results and\nexperimental study indicates that this method has significantly\ngreater statistical power on large divergent trees than other\ndistance methods methods, such as Neighbor Joining and the recent\nwork of Agarwala et al, Farach &amp; Kannan, and Cohen &amp;\nFarach, on approximating the L<sub>inf</sub>-nearest tree.</p>\n\n<p>Joint work with <a href=\"mailto:elp@math-inst.hu\">P&eacute;ter\nL.
