Typically the location of an object is known with certainty  \r\nonly at the time of the update. The uncertainty in its location increases until the next update. In this  \r\nenvironment, it is possible for queries to produce incorrect results based upon old data. However, if the  \r\ndegree of uncertainty is controlled, then the error of the answers to certain queries can be reduced. More  \r\ngenerally, query answers can be augmented with probabilistic estimates of the validity of the answer.  \r\nIn this paper we study the execution of such probabilistic, or imprecise, range and nearest-neighbor  \r\nqueries. The imprecision in queries is an inherent property of these applications due to uncertainty  \r\nin the data, unlike the techniques for approximate nearest-neighbor processing that trade-off accuracy  \r\nfor performance. Algorithms for computing these queries are presented for a generic object movement  \r\nmodel, and detailed solutions are discussed for two common models of uncertainty in moving object  \r\ndatabases. Furthermore, we study approximate evaluation of these queries that allow a trade-off between  \r\nexecution time and accuracy. The use of indexes for efficient execution of approximate queries over large  \r\ncollections of moving objects is also presented.  \r\n</p>  \r\n<BR>\r\n \r\n<p> <H3>Keywords:</H3> \r\n\t\t\tMoving objects, \r\n\t\t\tquerying imprecise data, \r\n            uncertainty, \r\n            uncertainty region, \r\n            models of uncertainty, \r\n            nearest neighbor query, NN query,   \r\n            probabilistic answer, \r\n            handling uncertainty, \r\n            location-aware computing \r\n</p>  \r\n<BR>\r\n  \r\n<p>  \r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3>\r\nExtended version: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/ICDE03_dvk.ext.pdf\">ICDE03_dvk.ext.pdf</A><BR>\r\nSee also our <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/SIGMOD03_dvk.html\">sensor environment solution</A> to a similar problem.  \r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?ICDE03_dvk\" width=1 height=1>  \r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3>\r\n<pre>@inproceedings{ICDE03::dvk,\r\n   author    = {Reynold Cheng and Sunil Prabhakar and Dmitri V.
