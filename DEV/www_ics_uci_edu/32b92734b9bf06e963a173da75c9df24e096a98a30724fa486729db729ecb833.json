The traditional approach to analyzing such\nbig datasets is to use powerful supercomputers (clusters), ideally large enough to store the data in main memory.  The downsides to\nthis approach are that many potential users of big data lack such powerful computational resources (e.g. point-of-sale Bitcoin\nblockchain analysis), and it can be difficult to solve unexpected problems within such a large infrastructure (e.g. image analysis\nafter the Boston Marathon Bombing).  Our main goal here is to enable the processing of huge datasets on computational devices with a\nlimited amount of fast memory, connected to a relatively slow external data source. In particular in this talk, we introduce two\nnew approaches of parameterized and promised  streaming  for optimization (often for NP-hard) problems over  dynamic graph\nstreams in which edges can be both inserted and deleted. We emphasize that indeed the approaches that we introduce in this talk\nhave relevance in Mapreduce and other distributed models and can be easily implemented in a variety of popular traditional models as well.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
