Berger, C. Borgs, J. T. Chayes, R. M. D.Souza, and R. D. Kleinberg\n</h2>\n<h2>\nPresented by: Jenny Lam \n</h2>\n\n<p>\nAbstract:\nModels based on preferential attachment have had much success\nin reproducing the power law degree distributions which seem ubiquitous\nin both natural and engineered systems. Here, rather than assuming\npreferential attachment, we give an explanation of how it can arise from\na more basic underlying mechanism of competition between opposing\nforces.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe introduce a family of one-dimensional geometric growth models,\nconstructed iteratively by locally optimizing the tradeoffs between two\ncompeting metrics. This family admits an equivalent description as a\ngraph process with no reference to the underlying geometry. Moreover,\nthe resulting graph process is shown to be preferential attachment with\nan upper cutoff. We rigorously determine the degree distribution for the\nfamily of random graph models, showing that it obeys a power law up to a\nfinite threshold and decays exponentially above this threshold.\nWe also introduce and rigorously analyze a generalized version of our\ngraph process, with two natural parameters, one corresponding to the\ncutoff and the other a .fertility. parameter. Limiting cases of this\nprocess include the standard preferential attachment model (introduced\nby Price and by Barabasi-Albert) and the uniform attachment model. In\nthe general case, we prove that the process has a power law degree\ndistribution up to a cutoff, and establish monotonicity of the power as\na function of the two parameters.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
