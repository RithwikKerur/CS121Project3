Computing tasks\nalways take longer than you think they will because unexpected problems\nand misunderstandings inevitably come up.  Even if you have experience with\nthe tools already, you won&#39;t be able to leave this until the day before\nit&#39;s due.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B>  For this assignment, you\nwill use the Web to gather information about a person (chosen from our list);\nusing this information you will create a Web page that gives a biographical\nsketch of the person.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B><U>Part I</U></B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Choosing your subject:</B>  First, you\nmust choose your subject--the person about whom you will gather information\nand create a web page.  You can&#39;t choose just anyone; you must select\na name from the list we will distribute in class.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your task will be to produce a web page containing\na short biographical sketch of this person.  Your sketch should contain\nthe basic details of the person&#39;s life--e.g., birthdate, birthplace,\nfamily, background--together with some description of the person&#39;s major\naccomplishments.  This does not have to be lengthy; a single page of text\nwill be plenty, not counting lists or quotations or illustrations.  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You may never have heard of the person you\npick; that&#39;s fine.  There is information on the Web for each of them,\nso this is an opportunity to learn something (and someone) new (which is\nwhat research is all about in the first place).  In your lab section on\nWednesday, October 8, your TA will have a sign-up sheet for selecting your\nperson.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Gathering information:  </B>Next, you must\ngather information about your person.  If possible, gather all of your information\nfrom the Web.  You&#39;re not prohibited from using other sources, but using\nthe Web is the point of the assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As you gather your information, keep a search\nlog describing which index and search services you visited, what search\nqueries you used, and what results they produced.  (Of course this should\nbe a computer-based document, Word or plain text.  You will copy and paste\nURLs and queries from your web browser into this document to save yourself\nfrom unpleasant transcribing.)  For each different search (and you should\ndo at least four), your search log should answer these questions:\n<BR>\n-- Which search service are you using?  (Give its URL.)\n<BR>\n-- Which options of the service have you selected?  (In Altavista, for example,\nyou may choose simple or advanced search; other services have other choices.)\n<BR>\n-- What was your query?\n<BR>\n-- How many &quot;hits&quot; did your query generate (i.e., how many matching\ndocuments were retrieved)?\n<BR>\n-- Does the service attempt to list the best hits first?  (There should\nbe a &quot;Help&quot; or &quot;Tips&quot; link that answers this.)  How\ndoes the service define &quot;best&quot;?\n<BR>\n-- How many of the &quot;hits&quot; looked promising enough to check out?\n Were there any humorously or outrageously inappropriate hits appearing\nearly in the list?\n<BR>\n-- What did you find at the sites you checked out?  (Give the URL and a\nfew words describing each useful site and the information you found there\nthat you plan to use on your web page.)\n<BR>\n-- How might you change your query (or selected options) next time to produce\nbetter results?</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>After you have found enough information, conclude\nyour search log with a paragraph giving your evaluation of which search\nservice was the most helpful and effective.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>For each major fact on your web page that\nisn&#39;t common knowledge, you will need to specify where you found it.\n Your search log will contain this information.  Provide those sources as\nlinks in the text of your web page; it is your choice whether you interleave\nyour sources in your text or gather them into an annotated source list at\nthe end.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As you do your research, note that your web\npage must include at least two images, one of which is a picture of the\nperson.  You must also include at least four hyperlinks to other information\nabout the person.  (For example, a page about Bill Clinton might include\nlinks to the White House, a list of Rhodes Scholars, a list of governors\nof Arkansas, and a page describing impeachment.)  Add this list of links\nto the end of your search log.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Also consider these hints and tips:\n<BR>\n-- To copy an image from the Web, just right-click on it and choose &quot;Save\nImage As&quot;.\n<BR>\n-- Try to avoid copying text or images that are copyrighted.\n<BR>\n-- Choose images that have high contrast, or they won&#39;t show up when\nyou print them on the grey-scale printers in the lab.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>In lab on Friday, October 10, show your TA\nyour search log, the list of links you will use on your web page, and the\nimage(s) you will use.  You will also submit these items through Checkmate.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B><U>Part II</U></B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Creating your web page:  </B>The first\nstep in any kind of writing, for the Web or not, is to decide what you want\nto say.  Write your text, using paper or some word processor, and decide\nhow and where you want to include your images, your sources, and any lists,\nquotations, or other features.  Take the time to produce clear and correct\nacademic prose.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You will turn this text into a web page in\ntwo steps, using two different tools:  You will start by using a plain text\neditor (called Notepad) to write HTML manually; you will finish with a WYSIWYG\n(what you see is what you get) editor, Netscape Composer.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Editing HTML manually:</B>  For a web browser\nlike Navigator or Explorer to display a web page, that page must be described\nin a language called HTML (Hypertext Markup Language).  HTML includes the\nplain text that appears on the page, along with &quot;tags&quot; or commands\nthat specify how to display the text, where to put images, and where links\nlink to.  An appendix to our text gives a reference to some common HTML\ntags.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>To start your page, open Notepad (from the\nStart menu, choose Programs, then Accessories).  Then type in the basic\nHTML template shown on the next page, along with one test sentence you can\nremove later:</FONT></P>\n<HR>\n<A NAME=\"_14_6059\"></A>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&lt;HTML&gt;     </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&lt;!-- </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">This\nis a comment, readable in the source but ignored by the browser <FONT SIZE=4>&gt;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; &lt;HEAD&gt;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160;  &#160; &lt;TITLE&gt;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160;  &#160;  &#160; David G. Kay&#39;s\nPage on Charles and Ray Eames</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160;  &#160; &lt;/TITLE&gt;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; &lt;/HEAD&gt;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; &lt;BODY&gt;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160;  &#160; This is a test sentence.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; &lt;/BODY&gt;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=4>&lt;/HTML&gt;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Now save the file, naming it <I>yourname</I></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">.html</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>--substitute\nyour own name, of course, and don&#39;t forget the </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">.html</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\nsuffix.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Next, open Netscape Communicator (Navigator),\nclick File, then Open Page, and choose your file.  Does it look the way\nyou expected it to?</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You will repeat this cycle, a very common\none in all kinds of software development:  Add some more text and tags to\nyour file using Notepad, then Save.  Switch to Navigator, click Reload/Refresh\n(because Navigator doesn&#39;t automatically know about your saved changes),\nand verify that your page looks as you intend.  Keep making small changes,\nthen checking your work; if you make too many changes before checking and\nthe check reveals something wrong, finding the problem becomes much harder.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>When you have finished entering about half\nof your page, save your work and submit it via Checkmate.  Print out the\nHTML source from Notepad; save a separate copy of that file for backup purposes;\nthen load your half-done page into Navigator and print the interpreted version\nof the page from there.  Now you are ready to go on to the second tool.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Using Netscape Composer as a WYSIWYG editor:</B>\n Open Netscape Composer, and then open the HTML file you have been working\non.  Composer will display the file in (almost) the same way a browser will,\nbut it will let you edit the file directly in this view!</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Continue editing your page until it is done,\nsaving and checking periodically in Navigator (which should not look much\ndifferent).  Make sure you have all the required elements:  images, references,\nhyperlinks.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>When you are done, print two versions of the\npage from Navigator:  the HTML source (using the View Source menu item)\nand the interpreted (finished) page.  Save the final HTML source and submit\nit via Checkmate.  Also submit the final set of images your page uses.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>With WYSIWYG tools available, why would anyone\nbother writing raw HTML?  There might be two reasons:  The WYSIWYG tools\ndon&#39;t always provide all the features of HTML, and hand-coding the HTML\nallows the designer more precise control over the page&#39;s ultimate appearance.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Also consider these hints and tips for building\nyour web page:\n<BR>\n-- Keep all your files, including images, in the same folder; otherwise\nthey may not show up when viewed with a browser.\n<BR>\n-- You can see the HTML source of any web page by using the &quot;View Source&quot;\nmenu item.  Often the source is impenetrably complex, but not always; see,\nfor example, the instructor&#39;s home page (</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>).\n<BR>\n-- The more elaborate your web page, the likelier there are to be differences\nin how it appears in different browsers.  Even though the Web is supposed\nto be a standard, universal medium, you will find that Navigator and Explorer\ndon&#39;t show the same HTML precisely the same way, nor do browsers on\nMacintosh or Unix systems.  You need not achieve a uniform look for this\nassignment, but trying to achieve uniformity gives real headaches to professional\nweb designers.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Open your web page using Explorer, print the\npage, and circle on the printout any differences between that version and\nthe Navigator version.  Show these differences to your TA in lab on the\ndue date.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your grade will depend on how thoroughly you\nprovide all the information we specify (including sources for that information),\nvarious lab activities (signing up, showing your TA your search log, and\nshowing your TA the differences between Navigator and Explorer), and the\ncorrectness and clarity of your web page&#39;s presentation (including clear\nand correct English prose). </FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Written by David G.
