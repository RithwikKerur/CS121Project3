We assume that you would like to learn what sort of\nresearch is going on, which people do what, and how to get connected\nwith a research project.  The major purpose of this course is to help you\nanswer those questions.\n\n<ul>\n  <li> Course time and location\n\t<ul>\n\t<li>Wednesdays 10:00-10:50&nbsp;am in ICS 243\n\t<li>Fridays 9:00-10:50&nbsp;am in SSL 248\n\t</ul>\n  <li> Instructor:\n\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~rickl\">Rick Lathrop</A>\n  <li> Office: Bren Hall 4224\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nTwo types of students take this course:\nstudents in the ICS Honors Program (ICSHP), and students in the Campuswide\nHonors Program (CHP).  In many ways the requirements are the same for\nboth types of students: you are to select a faculty advisor,\ndo two or more quarters of research with that advisor,\nand produce a report which is considered to be of honors quality.\nHowever, students in the Campuswide Honors Program should discuss their plans\nwith counselors in the CHP, in order to make sure that they are\nmeeting the requirements of that program.\n\n<p>\nOn most Fridays we will meet jointly with the ICS 200\ncourse, Seminar in Research in ICS, in which faculty give talks about\ntheir research; the students enrolled in ICS 200 are typically new\ngraduate students.  On Wednesdays we will have various discussions\nspecifically for undergraduate honors students.\n\n<p>\nTwo people primarily oversee the ICS Honors Program: the <i>honors\nprogram advisor</i> (or more briefly just the <i>program\nadvisor</i>) is the faculty member in charge of the program, currently\nRick Lathrop.  The counselor for the program, currently Neha Rawal,\nwill help orient students and track their progress.  Feel\nfree to ask us any questions about the Program.\n\n<p>\nThe most important person for you is your <i>faculty advisor</i> (note\nthat this is different from the program advisor). This is the faculty member\nwith whom you will do your project, and varies from student to\nstudent.\n\n<p>\n\nSeveral types of meetings are planned for this seminar, including the\nfollowing.\n\n<ul>\n<li> We will meet with you \nto give you an overview of the program.\n\n<li> Many of the faculty will give a presentation\nabout their research interests.\n\n<li> We may have other visitors, such as a panel of current ICS Honors Program\nstudents, a panel of graduate students, etc.\n\n<li> We will ask students in the class to talk about research projects\nthey are investigating.\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nOne of your major goals in this course is to gain an understanding of\nwhat research is being pursued in the School and what areas might\nbe of interest to you for your project.  This is crucial, since it\nshould help you complete your second goal, selection of your faculty\nadvisor.  Remember that the arrangement must be mutually acceptable,\nso there is no guarantee that the first faculty member you talk to\nwill say yes; it may be, for example, that they have no suitable\nproject in mind at the time you ask.\n\n<p>\n\nIt is not imperative that you begin your research\nimmediately next quarter if your schedule for graduation allows you\nenough time.  However, there are some important advantages to starting\nfairly soon, and we encourage you to begin by spring quarter.\nStarting early gives you more flexibility with regard to finishing the\nrest of your degree requirements, especially if you want to continue\nthe research for more than two quarters.  Also, students often find\nthat faculty who have supervised their honors research project are\ngood sources for letters of recommendation; they will be in the best position\nto comment on your ability if you are well into your research project.\n\n<p>\n\n<h2>\nCourse requirements\n</h2>\n\nThis course is graded Pass/Not Pass, and the principal formal\nrequirement is that you attend and participate.  Some of the class\nexercises may involve students giving feedback to fellow students, and\nyour active participation is necessary for everyone to get the most\nbenefit from this.  Occasional absences are inevitable given busy\nschedules, and will be excused on a case-by-case basis; \nmake sure you sign the attendance sheet each class period you\nattend.  \n\n<p>\nStudents who are in the ICSHP are required to take ICS H197 in the\nfall of their first quarter of the ICSHP.  If they have time conflicts\nwith part of the course, they should talk to the ICS H197 instructor\n(currently George Lueker); he may approve their enrollment in the\ncourse even if they have to miss some sessions.  If they have\nconflicts with too many of the sessions he may not approve this.  In\nextreme cases students may be allowed to attend a specified number of\nICS research colloquia, and write a specified number of one-page\nreports on some of these colloquia, instead of taking the ICS H197.\nSuch students should first see Josh Cimenski in the ICS SAO to explore\nwhether some of the conflicts can be avoided; if they can't be, they\nshould ask the ICS H197 instructor to approve the alternate plans.\n\n<p>\n\n<!--Additionally, we will require a series of mini-assignments to help get\nyou started on doing research.  These will be intended to introduce\nyou to some of the basic steps in research: making collaborative\ncontacts, reviewing the literature, speaking, and writing, as well as\nto make you aware of scholarship and graduate school opportunities.\nSome of the possibilities we are considering include (a)&nbsp;research\nscholarship opportunities; (b)&nbsp;attend the Grad School workshop, go to\nthe grad school fair, research one grad school, write up a brief\nreport; (c)&nbsp;literature search and write-up; (d)&nbsp;attend one colloquium\nor seminar during the quarter, write up a brief report; (e)&nbsp;read one\nresearch paper from the literature, criticize it; (f)&nbsp;make contact\nwith potential faculty members; (g)&nbsp;prepare short scientific or\ntechnical abstracts and talks.  We would like your feedback as to\nwhich of these would be most useful.\n-->\n\n<p>\n\n<h2>\nICS H198: Honors Research\n</h2>\n\nTo complete the honors program you must do two quarters of\nindependent, supervised work (ICS 198) with your faculty advisor.  (In\nsome cases, your advisor might ask you to take a graduate course to\nsubstitute for the first quarter.)  Passing the 198s does not\nnecessarily guarantee successful completion of the honors program,\nhowever.  For the ICSHP, the results of your honors work must be\ncertified by your faculty advisor and by the program advisor to be of\nhonors quality.  (Again, students in the CHP should keep in touch with\ncounselors in that program about the requirements.)\n\n<ul>\n<li> students majoring in ICS or CS can count completion of two ICS H198s as\none project course.\n\n<li> students majoring in CSE can count CSE 181ABC as one of the ICS\nH198s required for the Honors Program.\n\n<li> students majoring in CSE can count Engr H199 as one of the ICS\nH198s required for the Honors Program.\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>\n<h2>\nFinding a faculty advisor\n</h2>\n\nYou are responsible for making contact with faculty members to discuss\ntheir research and find a faculty advisor.  We require you to make at least\nthree contacts every quarter until you have found an advisor and\nsubmitted the \"Initial Plan\" described next.  Until the \"Initial\nPlan\" has been submitted, you must submit a \"Faculty Contact\nReport\" to the Counseling Office shortly after the end of each quarter.\nThis gives a brief\none-paragraph summary of the faculty contacts you have made in the\nprevious quarter (at least three).  This requirement begins the\nquarter you take ICS H197.\n\n<p>\n\nTo make a faculty contact, (a)&nbsp;review the department Computing\nResearch Review to determine research interests; (b)&nbsp;call or email\nin advance, ask for any background reading material, and schedule an\nappointment; (c)&nbsp;read the background material, if any, and possibly\nmake a trip to the library to find out more about the general area;\n(d)&nbsp;show up for the interview prepared with a list of points about the\nresearch area that you find interesting, and a list of questions about\nthe area that you would like to know more about; (e)&nbsp;after the\ninterview, send a thank-you note thanking the faculty member for their\ntime.\n\n<p>\n\nIt is important not to be discouraged if your first few contacts don't\nresult in finding an appropriate faculty advisor.  Keep trying.  You\ncan improve your chances by first doing even more background reading\nin the area before you talk to a faculty member, so that you appear to\nbe interested and informed.  You can also improve your chances by\ntalking to a wider variety of faculty members, which will expose you\nto a wider range of research possibilities.  Do be sensitive to their\ntime constraints; don't be a bother, but do be persistent.\n\n<p>\n\n<h2>\nGetting started on your research\n</h2>\n\nWhen you have found a faculty advisor, work out a plan for how you\nwill begin to tackle the research.  Then fill out the \"Initial Plan\"\nform at the end of this document.  (In some cases your plan might be a\nprogram of study at first, rather than a description of your specific\nproject.  In any case, though, a brief description of your plans and\ngoals should be included.)  This should be approved by both you and\nyou faculty advisor, and submitted to the program advisor.  \nYou are encouraged to discuss\nyour plans with the program advisor as they are forming.\n\nIt is important for you to maintain contact with your faculty advisor, and\nto make sure you know whether s/he feels that your work is progressing\nadequately.  As an extreme example, you want to avoid a situation in\nwhich you don't talk to your advisor after your first meeting, turn in\na paper after two quarters of 198, and then find that the advisor\nconsiders it to be inadequate.  To help avoid this sort of thing,\nschedule regular meetings with your advisor to discuss your progress.\n\n<p>\n\nIf you are in the CHP you should finish your research in accordance\nwith the requirements of the CHP.  The remainder of this document\nformally applies only to ICSHP students.  However, we encourage\nICS students in the CHP also to follow these procedures so that we can keep\ntrack of your progress.\n\n<h2>\nCompleting the program\n</h2>\n\n\nAt the end of your second quarter\nof independent study with your faculty advisor, you should prepare a paper\ndescribing the project and the results.  Again, the format may vary\nconsiderably from one project to another.  For example, one student\nmight produce a well-documented program to be used in a lab in one of\nour courses, and also provide a paper describing the design choices,\nrationale, and experience with the use of the program.  Another\nstudent might not do any programming, but rather do a statistical\nstudy of the use of computers in some organization, and write a\ncareful scholarly interpretation of the results (perhaps 20 pages)\nwith appropriate references to the literature.\n\n<p>\n\nAfter the paper is complete, first have your faculty advisor sign the \"Final\nReport on the Honors Project\" form, then bring the signed form and\nthe paper to the program advisor to sign, and finally bring the form\nwith both signatures and the paper to the Counseling Office.  The\nnormal deadline is June 1; if you will be late, please make\narrangements with the Counseling Office well in advance.  Once the\npaper is approved by your advisor and the form is signed by both\nadvisors, you are considered to have successfully completed the ICSHP.\n\n<p>\n\nIf at any point in this process you have any questions, don't hesitate\nto discuss them with the program advisor or Counseling Office.\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center>\n<H2>Faculty Contact Report for the Honors Project</H2>\n<h3> (To be submitted by the student to the Counseling Office) </h3>\n</center>\n\n<p>\n\nThis form must be filed shortly after the end of each quarter until a faculty\nadvisor has been found and the \"Initial Plan\" has been filed.\n\n<p>\n\nStudent name and ID#:\n\n<p>\n\nFor which quarter and year:\n\n<p>\n\nPlease describe (by name, date, and result) the faculty contacts\nyou have made this quarter (three per quarter are required).
