One distinguishing\nfeature about the Web is that it uses the <A HREF=\"http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/wic/html.03.html\">HTML</A> markup\nlanguage.  This allows information from a variety of documents to be linked together in a continuous format. This ease\nof use is what makes the Web so popular, and the amount of information it is able to provide is growing at an\nastonishing rate everyday. Despite the vast amount of computer systems,\n<A HREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html\">Universal Resource Identifiers</A>, or URLs, \nallow users to link up to the various servers.  URIs are addresses of servers that provide specific information.  \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>With the vast amount of information available on the Web, how does one find a desired piece of\ndocument?</H2></A>\nMy answer is... Like a library catalog, one can use different techniques to search for a piece of information.  The\nfirst way is to search for a particular subject.  A comprehensive center is the\n<A HREF=\"http.info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html\">CERN Virtual Library</A>.  Here one can\nbegin to search for subject-oriented information.  Another great center for subject-oriented search is the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.einet.net/galaxy.html\">Galaxy</A> developed by EINet.  As with any searches, having more resources\nincreases the chances of a successful find.  Another way to search for information on the Web is by using keywords.\nTo use this in the Web, one can access the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html\">World Wide Web Worm</A>.  To use the Worm, one has to type\nan exact keyword pattern; the pattern, however, is case insensitive.  These two types of searches should allow the\nuser to find the desired piece of document.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>What is QQ3?</H2></A>\nMy answer is... Tobacco smoke induces changes in the respiratory cell layers.  It has been found that tobacco smoke\ncontains a variety of tumorigenic agents, including several that can act as complete carcinogens by themselves.  In\naddition, tumor initiators, promoters, and cocarcinogens have also been identified in smoke.  This leads to a broad\ndisease subject called <A HREF=\"http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/0/topics/smoking_1\">Lung Cancer</A>.  One of the more\nrecent topics that have been identified with smoking in addition to promoting cancer is the topic of risks in\n<A HREF=\"http://cancer.med.upenn.edu/0h/buhle/cancer_news/smoke_child.html\">pregnant mothers smoking</A>.  Infants of\nsmoking mothers are small for their gestational age in weight, length, and head circumference, and they experience a\nhigher perinatal mortality.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>What is Gopher and how does it differ from the Web and FTP?</H2></A>\nMy answer is... The Gopher system is like the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html\">World Wide Web</A> in that it can access the same\ninformation using various servers such as FTP, telnet, or WAIS.  However, the method of display in Gopher is very \ndifferent from the World Wide Web.  Although the Gopher also uses\n<A HREF=\"http://cuiwww.unige.ch/w3catalog/nsp.html\">hyperlink</A> documents, it does not utilize the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html\">hypertext</A> enviroment.  For example, if one connects \nto the <A HREF=\"http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/wic/netinfo.44.html\">Gopher Jewels Server</A>, one would find a set of \nmenus with links to other documents.  FTP, on the other hand, does not utilize any form of hyperlink technology.  \nRather, it is a protocol for directly transferring files.  A list of\n<A HREF=\"http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/wic/netinfo.24.html\">Anonymous FTP sites</A> contains sites for a broad range of\ninformation.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>How are pain and touch signals transmitted to the brain for processing?</H2></A>\nMy answer is... The most simple model of sensory information transmission can be found in the <A \nHREF=\"http://george.lbl.gov/ITG.hm.pg.docs/Whole.Frog/Whole.Frog.html\">anatomy of a frog</A>.  The Free Nerve \nEndings and Meissner's Corpuscles detect pain, temperature, and light touch.  Each touch receptor is specialized \nfor specific types of signals.  The touch receptors transform the signals into electrical neural signals which \ntravel to special parts of the brain for processing.  This transformation of enviromental energy into electrical \nenergy is called transduction, and this electrical energy travel through <A \nHREF=\"http://george.lbl.gov/ITG/Whole.Frog/frog/label4.jpg\">cutnaeous nerves</A>, which line the deepest \nskin layers.  Thus, sensory information is transduced into electrical signals, which travel through nerves to the \nbrain.  \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted January 30, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
