In general if you have a fraction\nN/D you can generate an expansion\n\n       N         1         1          1          1\n      ---  =   ----  +   ----   +   ----   +   ----   +  ...\n       D       d[0]      d[1]       d[2]       d[3]\n\nthat is quadratically convergent (i.e., the number of correct digits \nroughly doubles with each term) using the recurrence\n\n    (N+k) d[k+1]    =    (N+k-1) d[k]^2  -  (N+k) d[k]  +  (N+k+1)\n\nwith the initial value d[0] = 1 + (D+1)/N.  We can re-write this\nrecurrence in the form\n\n                                            d[k]^2 - 1\n      d[k+1]  =  d[k]^2  -  d[k]  +  1  -   ----------              (1)\n                                               N+k\n\nOf course this doesn't guarantee that the values of d[j] are necessarily\nintegers.  To make d[0] an integer we must have D=-1 (mod N).  Thereafter\non the kth step we must have d[k]^2 - 1 divisible by (N+k), which implies\nthat d[k] = +1 or -1 (mod N+k).\n\nTaking the fraction 5/179 as an example, we have N=5 and D=179, which\ngives \n          d[0] = 37\n          d[1] = 1105\n          d[2] = 1045489\n          d[3] = 956415297493\n          d[4] = 813093530024486866555885\n          d[5] = 2975044898554565064901765456700565614513893820093/5\n\nThis gives a unit fraction expansion up until the denominator d[5], \nwhich is not an integer because d[4] = 4 (mod 9), so it's not congruent \nto +1 or -1 (mod N+k).  As a result, the sequence of remainders is\n\n            6, 7, 8, 9, 2,...\n\nThe numerator of \n\n             N/D - 1/d[0] - 1/d[1] - 1/d[2] - 1/d[3] - 1/d[4]\n\nshould be 10, but d[4] happens to be divisible by 5, so the reduced \nnumerator is 2.  As a result the recurrence stops giving integers, because\nit's based on the assumption that the remainders increase by 1 at each\nstep.  Of course, we can start the recurrence over again with this new\nvalue of N/D.\n\nFor another example, consider the fraction found by Stan Wagon, 3/179.\nIn this case the recurrence formula (1) gives\n\n     d[0] = 61\n     d[1] = 2731\n     d[2] = 5963959\n     d[3] = 29640666497443\n     d[4] = 753059237496518829212535343\n     d[5] = 496210938281483556785833636950652507016084391058576351\n\n                  and so on\n\nAs Stan discovered, recurrence (1) with the initial value d[0]=61 gives\ninteger values for a long time, up to 19 terms.  The factorizations of \nd[k]-1 are somewhat cumulative, as shown below\n\n   d[0]-1 = (2)(2)(3)   (5)\n   d[1]-1 = (2)   (3)   (5)(7)    (13)\n   d[2]-1 = (2)   (3)(3)   (7)(11)(13)(331)\n   d[3]-1 = (2)   (3)      (7)    (13)(331)                     (14909897)\n   d[4]-1 = (2)   (3)         (11)(13)(331)(7505)(77839)(323759)(14909897)\n   d[5]-1 = (d[4]-1)(3)(3)(5)(5)(big composite)\n\nIf we let f_N(n) denote one less than the index of the first non-integer \nvalue given by the recurrence formula (1) with the initial value d[0]=n, \nthen we saw previously that f_5(37) = 4.  I've also found that f_3(51)=2.  \nJudging from the remainders quoted by Stan in his email I'd guess that \nf_3(61)=13.  It would be interesting to tabulate f(n) for each value of n \nup to, say 1000.  Of course, this doesn't completly describe an expansion,\nbecause once the integers break down you can start over again with the \nnew N/D, as illustrated by the remainders in Stan's example\n\n  3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,    2, 3, 4,    1\n |---------------------------------------------------|   |--------|  |-|\n\nNevertheless, it would be interesting to know the lengths of just the\nfirst unbroken sequence for each initial value, to see if 61 is the\noptimum.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are arbitrarily large values\nof f_3(n).  To put it another way, it would be surprising if there was\nsome finite upper limit to f_3(n).  A similar survey could be done for\nf_N(n) for other values of N.\n\nThis all must be closely related to Sylvester's sequence, defined in\nSloane's Handbook of Integer Sequences (M0865) as \n\n                  a(n+1) = a(n)^2 - a(n) + 1\n\nThis is the same as formula (1) except it doesn't have the last term\ninvolving N.\n\nAnyway, I suppose you could estimate the expected value of f_N(n) for\nany given N and n, because it seems to just be a matter of whether each\nd[k] is or is not congruent to +-1 (mod N+k).  Assuming d[k] is equally\nlikely to be in any of the N+k equivalence classes mod N+k, this gives\na probability of 2/(N+k) that the kth step will give an integer.  This\ncertainly suggests that small numerators N will give the best chance\nfor long strings.  I suppose the probability of j consecutive integers\nis something like\n                           N!\n                         ------ 2^j\n                         (N+j)!\n\nHmmm...this suggests that Stan's example has a probability of about\n1 in 425,675,250.  Maybe the assumption of equi-probable equivalence\nclasses is wrong?\n\nRegards,\nKevin Brown\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>Date:</b>           Sun, 20 Oct 1996 12:35:54 -0700 (PDT)\n<b>From:</b>           Milo Gardner &lt;<a href= \n\"mailto:gardnerm@gaia.ecs.csus.edu\">gardnerm@gaia.ecs.csus.edu</a>&gt;\n<b>To:</b>             David Eppstein &lt;<a href= \n\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</a>&gt;\n<b>Subject:</b>        Re: Is this view interesting?\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nHi David ad Stan:\n\nIt appears that Kevin's approach would benefit by appying Mathematica\nto Stan's 3/179 discussion.

Stan's example is the first with numerator \n3, followed by 3/197, 3/377, and so on.  Each of these gives integer values \nfor AT LEAST the initial 9 steps of the recurrence.  That's as far as \nUBASIC will go before overflowing.  I may try to get access to a program\nlike Maple or Mathematica that (I think) can handle larger numbers.  Failing\nthat, I may try to write a program that evaluates the recurrence (mod p)\nfor various primes p, which should enable me to determine how long the\nsequence goes on giving integers (although it won't tell me what those\nintegers are).\n\nksb wrote:\n&gt;&gt; This all must be closely related to Sylvester's sequence, defined in\n&gt;&gt; Sloane's Handbook of Integer Sequences (M0865) as \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;                   a(n+1) = a(n)^2 - a(n) + 1\n\nAt 09:04 AM 10/20/96 -0700, Milo Gardner wrote:\n&gt; That is to say, in what context did Sylvster define the above\n&gt; relationship?\n\nI don't really know.

You asked to be sent any solutions.\n\nAs I believe you know, I have a large collection of algorithms for\nconstructing Egyptian fractions, published in Mathematica in Educ. &amp;\nRes., and online at <a href= \n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/numth/egypt/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/numth/egypt/</a>\nMost of these methods produce some even denominators, but a few do not.\n(Beware, I probably introduced some typos transferring these from my Mac\nto my Sun.)\n\nEgyptOddGreedy[3/179] didn't terminate in a reasonable amount of time.\nI assume this is why you chose this particular fraction to ask about...\n\nThe proofs I know of that odd representations exist are I think pretty\nsimilar to the method I implemented as EgyptRemainder, which takes as a\nsecond argument a \"powerful\" number (with lots of divisors so that there\nare lots of ways to form sums of divisors).  If the powerful number is\nodd, you get odd representations, modulo some recombination that happens\nbecause of possible repeated terms.

At each step the divisions you do\ncause the base to (usually) decrease; so the method could terminate due\nto lack of information rather than terminating due to reaching zero.\n\nAnyway, I started from 3/x and worked through all possible sequences of\nnumerators from there.  There are many fewer than one might expect:\n\n- If x is 1 mod 5 the sequence is {3,1}.\n- If x is 5 or 11 mod 30 the sequence is {3,4,1}.\n- If x is 23 mod 30 the sequence is {3,4,5,4,1}.\n- If x is 29,47,59, or 77 mod 90 the sequence is {3,4,5,1}.\n- If x is 17,269,287 or 539 mod 630 the sequence is {3,4,5,6,1}.\n- If x is 89 or 467 mod 630 the sequence is {3,4,5,6,7,2,1}.\n\nThe remaining cases, 107,179,197,359,377,449,557, and 629 mod 630\nall begin with the same sequence {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...}.\nStarting from here I got a little sloppy about exhaustively searching\nall values, so my results are a little suspect, but it seems that\ndepending on the value of x mod 3050, the next numerator should be\neither 3 or 11. The values of x leading to a 3 seem to all have the\nsequence {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,3,4,1}.  The values of x leading to 11\neither have the sequence {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1} (if x has the right value\nmod 11 to cause a cancellation) or {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,...}.\n\nAs you computed over a year ago, the full sequence of numerators for\n3/179 is {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,2,3,4,1} so this pattern\nof increasing the numerator by one continues for many more steps.  But\nwhy does this increase happen so often for such a small number as 179?\nWhy are there so few other choices for possible numerator sequences?\nAll numerator sequences I've seen so far either terminate quickly or\neventually fall into the increase-by-one pattern e.g. 5/3809:\n{5,2,3,4,5,6,7,...}; why?\n\n-d\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</a>\n<b>To:</b>             <a href=\n\"mailto:wagon@macalester.edu\">wagon@macalester.edu</a>\n<b>Subject:</b>        odd greedy\n<b>Date:</b>           Tue, 25 Nov 1997 16:19:12 -0800\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n    All numerator sequences I've seen so far either terminate quickly or\n    eventually fall into the increase-by-one pattern e.g. 5/3809:\n    {5,2,3,4,5,6,7,...}; why?\n\nOops, not 3809, I meant 3803 (or other numbers congruent to 83, 203, or\n263 mod 300).\n\nIn fact I wonder whether you meant 3809 when you sent the following\nparagraph to your potw mailing list:\n\n    David Bailey (and I) continue to wonder about 5/3809's behavior\n    under odd greedy.

So the first digits of the\ndenominators are easy, and the last digits are also easy (by the modular\narithmetic I've been doing), it's the middle that's hard (because it's\ntoo big, not unlike certain peoples' middles in this holiday season). \n\nI could even modify my program to output a straight-line-program for\nevaluating all the denominators, e.g. d1=(an explicit integer),\nd2=(some explicit quadratic in d1), d3=(some explicit quadratic in d2),\netc.  But of course you wouldn't have the time and space to actually\nexpand all these quadratics in exact integer arithmetic...\n\n    So your latest example might involve a trillion digits! \n\nFrom 7 to 38 involves 32 doublings of the number of digits.\nSo the total number of digits should be roughly 25*2^32 ~ 10^11,\nsomewhat shy of the trillions.\n\n-d\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
