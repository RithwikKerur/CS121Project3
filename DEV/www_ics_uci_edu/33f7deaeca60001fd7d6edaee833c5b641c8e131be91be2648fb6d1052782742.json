The significant difference in NVMs is the fact that the cost\nof writing data is significantly higher than the cost of reading\nit.  This asymmetry requires new algorithmic techniques, which allow\nthe trade-off of write accesses for extra read accesses during\ncomputation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn this talk I will present sorting algorithms, which achieve such a\ntrade-off between read and write accesses in the AEM model. If time\npermits, I will also show a lower bound that proves that this\ntrade-off is asymptotically optimal.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
