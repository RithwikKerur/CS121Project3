The idea is that you have two documents which are supposed to be forked variants of the same original, but the changes aren\u2019t neatly stored in revision marks. With lawyers, this is usually because the opposing party is hostile and doesn\u2019t want to make things easier for you. On the Web, this could be because the person you gave the document to didn\u2019t have a revision-savvy editor. So what you basically need to do is run a DIFF on two arbitrary documents, and generate revision marks from that. After that, other issues like merge and review reduce to the easier case.</P>\n\n<P></P>\n\n<P>This comparison is not trivial. In a classic text file DIFF, you just point out which lines differ. But in a real document, you want to show how they differ - what happened. Inferring what happened from what\u2019s left is imprecise, though. It can be very hard to tell if A moved a paragraph and B deleted half of it, or if A left it alone and B moved half and deleted the rest, and so on.  We have heuristics that guess but they\u2019re imperfect.</P>\n\n<P></P>\n\n<P>Unfortunately, this will probably be a likely scenario until there is a widely supported revision scheme.</P>\n\n<P> </P> \n <!-- <H2>Compare documents</H2>\n\n</P>\n\n<P><UL><LI>User problem<UL><LI>diff for arbitrary documents </UL><LI>Solution<UL><LI>Low-level compare<LI>Heuristics for ambiguous differences</UL><LI>Web considerations<UL><LI>Likely scenario unless there is universal revision scheme</UL></UL></P>\n\n<P>  --> \n</Body>\n</HTML>", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
