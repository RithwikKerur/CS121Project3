<i>denominatio</i> or\n    <i>pars pro toto</i> (part for the whole).&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li> The pen is mightier than the sword (pen is a metonym for writing;&nbsp;\n    sword is a metonym for violence).&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li> <q>The White House</q>, to refer to\n    the President of the United States and his advisors.&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li> <q>The press</q>, to refer to the news media\n    (especially newspapers).&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li> <q>A dish</q>, to refer to an entree.&nbsp;\n    </li>\n    <li> <q>Hollywood</q> to refer to the American film industry\n    (this is also a toponym).&nbsp;\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    Metonymy works by contiguity rather than similarity.&nbsp;\n    The printing press produces newspapers\n    (hence, <q>the press</q> for the news media);&nbsp;\n    food is presented on a dish (hence <q>dish</q> for entree).&nbsp;\n    However, when people use metonymy,\n    they don't typically wish to transfer qualities as they do with metaphor:&nbsp;\n    there is nothing house-like about the president, crown-like about the king,\n    or plate-like about an entree.&nbsp;\n    Rather, metonymy transfers a whole set of associations\n    which may or may not be integral to the meaning.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In linguistics, as in rhetoric,\n    the distinction between metaphor and metonymy is important.&nbsp;\n    Two examples using the term <q>fishing</q> help make the distinction clear\n    (example drawn from Dirven, 1996).&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The phrase <q>to fish pearls</q> uses metonymy,\n    drawing from <q>fishing</q> the idea of taking things from the ocean.&nbsp;\n    What is carried across from <q>fishing fish</q>\n    to <q>fishing pearls</q>\n    is the domain of usage and the associations with the ocean and boats,\n    but we understand the phrase\n    in spite of rather than because of the literal meaning of fishing:&nbsp;\n    we know you do not use a fishing rod or net to get pearls.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    In contrast, the metaphorical phrase <q>fishing for information</q>,\n    transfers the concept of fishing\n    (waiting, hoping to catch something that you can't see) into a new domain.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Thus, metonymy works by calling up a domain of usage and an array of associations\n    (in the example above, boats, the ocean, gathering life from the sea)\n    whereas metaphor picks a target set of meanings\n    and transfers them to a new domain of usage.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Synecdoche, where a specific part of something is taken to refer to the whole,\n    is usually understood as a specific kind of metonymy.&nbsp;\n    Sometimes, however,\n    people make an absolute distinction between a metonymy and a synecdoche,\n    treating metonymy as different from rather than inclusive of synecdoche.&nbsp;\n    There is a similar problem with the usage of simile and metaphor.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When the distinction is made, it is the following:&nbsp;\n     when A is used to refer to B,\n     it is a synecdoche if A is a part of B and a metonym\n     if A is commonly associated with B but not a part of it.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Thus,\n    <q>The White House said</q> would be a metonymy for\n    the president and his staff,\n    because the White House (A) is not part of the president or his staff (B),\n    it is merely closely associated with them because of physical proximity.&nbsp;\n    On the other hand,\n    asking for <q>All hands on deck</q> is a synecdoche because\n    hands (A) are actually a part of the men (B) to whom they refer.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    There is an example which displays synecdoche,\n    metaphor and metonymy in one sentence.&nbsp;\n    <q>Fifty keels ploughed the deep</q>,\n    where <q>keels</q> is the synecdoche as it takes a part (of the ship)\n    as the whole (of the ship);&nbsp;\n    <q>ploughed</q> is the metaphor as it substitutes the concept of\n    ploughing a field for moving through the ocean;&nbsp;\n    and <q>the deep</q> is the metonym,\n    as <q>deepness</q> is an attribute associated with the ocean.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Cf. <a
