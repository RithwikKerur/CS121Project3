Brandenburg, Michael Himsolt and Christoph Rohrer\n</h2>\n\n<p>\nThe authors report on experiments with fivegraph drawing algorithms \nfor general undirected graphs. These are the algorithms FR introduced \nby Fruchterman and Reingold , KK by Kamada and Kawai , DH by Davidson \nand Harel , Tu by Tunkelang  and GEM by Frick, Ludwig and Mehldau. \nThey tested these algorithms on a wide collection of examples and \nwith different settings of parameters.  \nExamples are from original papers and by their own. \n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
