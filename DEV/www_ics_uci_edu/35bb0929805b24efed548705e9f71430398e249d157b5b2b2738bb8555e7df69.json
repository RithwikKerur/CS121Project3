Simply type in any string and press enter to reply.\r\nIf you wish to quit the game, type in 'q'.\r\n\r\n\r\n[DIFFERENT AI LEVELS]\r\n\r\nThere are 3 different agents provided in this zip file:\r\n\t1. DummyAgent\t- allows user to \"self play\" and decide the agent's move. \r\n\t2. PoorAgent\t- poor AI that never shoots arrow and miscalculates pit likelihood.\r\n\t3. AverageAgent - average AI that finds the gold most of the time and exits safely.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOnce it finds the gold, it traces back the path it took to find the gold\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(inefficient and not optimized).\r\n\t4. SmartAgent - smart AI that ALWAYS finds the gold and exits the cave safely OR \r\n\t\t\t\t\texits the cave without gold when there are no longer safe moves to make.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOnce the agent finds the gold, it finds the shortest path back to the exit.\r\n\r\n\r\n[USING DIFFERENT AI]\r\n\r\nBy default, the game runs using SmartAgent. However, you can choose to run other Agent versions\r\nby commenting/uncommenting a few lines of code in World.hpp and World.cpp. \r\n\tWorld.cpp (lines 117-120)\r\n\tWorld.hpp (lines 41-44)\r\n\r\nIn both header and cpp files of World, comment out SmartAgent line and \r\nuncomment the agent you wish to run. Recompile and run the game. \r\n\r\n\r\n(Note: Attempted to allow user to select AI level in the beginning of the game \r\n(in game configuration) but did not work due to the game logic design.\r\nC++ variables are not type-free and would not allow overwrite/assignment to \r\ndifferent agent types!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[ABBREVIATIONS ON GAME BOARD]\r\n\r\n\t-S \tDeadWumpus\r\n\tW \tWumpus\r\n\tB \tBreeze\r\n\tS \tStench\r\n\tG \tGold\r\n\tP \tPit\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email mwee@uci.edu.\r\nPoor/Average/Smart AI created by Minjae Wee", "encoding": "ascii"}
