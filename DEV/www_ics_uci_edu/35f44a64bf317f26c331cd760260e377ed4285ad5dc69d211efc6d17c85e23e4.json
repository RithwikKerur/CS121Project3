On Wednesday her\r\nremaining sister, Nedra Glasser, 84; Nedra's daughter, Abbe; and I buried\r\nher at Mt. Hebron in Queens.  (Unfortunately it was the coldest day of the\r\nweek and had a biting wind to boot so it was a short ceremony.)\r\n\r\nWhile we were there Abbe and I visited the office to see which other family\r\ngraves are in that cemetery and came up with quite a few in the Bnei Joseph\r\nDegel area of Block 11, Path 14, Section 6.  I imagine that you have been\r\nthere.  Seeing so many Blaus, Dillers and Langsams side by side makes me\r\nthink that there probably is a real connection, but Nedra, 84, does not\r\nreally know what it is.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what we particularly noted was the grave of a Gitel Blau.  Gitel is\r\nNedra's middle name.  I saw from your website that the name also occurs in\r\nthe Langsam family.\r\n\r\nAbbe and I plan to return in the spring when it is warmer.\r\n\r\nDo you have any information to share on Bnei Joseph Degel?\r\n\r\nThanks for keeping in touch!\r\n\r\nNaomi\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nAuthor:  &quot;Naomi Geschwind&quot; &lt;naomi-g@email.msn.com&gt; at INTERNET\r\nDate:    1/30/98  10:13 AM\r\nPriority: Normal\r\nTO: Moishe Miller at CCSP27B1\r\nSubject: Langsam\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\nYour Langsam material is very impressive.  I wish I could tell you how I fit \r\nin but I don't know.  My great aunt says that there was a family named \r\nLangsam that she remembers from childhood and whom she believes were related \r\nto either the Blaus or the Dillers of Sanok, Galicia.  I will look through \r\nyour material and see if I spot possible connections.\r\n     \r\nThanks for writing to me!\r\n     \r\nNaomi\r\n     \r\n_____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: moishe@langsam.com &lt;moishe@langsam.com&gt;\r\nTo: naomi-g@email.msn.com &lt;naomi-g@email.msn.com&gt;\r\nDate: Sunday, March 14, 1999 11:45 PM\r\nSubject: Re: Langsam\r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nWanted to touch base again. I know you were in contact with Suzan Wynne at\r\nsome point. I just wanted to flesh out what part of the tree you come from.\r\nCan you target the two oldest generations of &quot;Langsam&quot; that you are aware\r\nof?\r\nThanks!\r\n-Moishe\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\n___________________________________________________\r\nFrom:  naomi-g@email.msn.com\r\nSubject:  Re: Langsam\r\nPostedDate:  03/15/99 09:39:55 PM\r\nSendTo:  CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential\r\nDeliveredDate:  03/15/99 11:40:56 PM\r\n\r\nWe're not anywhere in particular yet.
