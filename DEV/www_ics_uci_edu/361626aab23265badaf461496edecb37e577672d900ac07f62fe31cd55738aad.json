As each job arrives, its processing time is known. The\ngoal is to minimize the makespan. Bartal, Fiat, Karloff and Vohra\ngave a deterministic online algorithm that is 1.986-competitive.\nKarger, Phillips and Torng generalized the algorithm and proved an\nupper bound of 1.945. The best lower bound currently known on the\ncompetitive ratio that can be achieved by deterministic online\nalgorithms is equal to 1.837. In this paper we present an improved\ndeterministic online scheduling algorithm that is\n1.923-competitive, for all m &gt;= 2. The algorithm is based on a\nnew scheduling strategy, i.e., it is not a generalization of the\napproach by Bartal et al. Also, the algorithm has a simple\nstructure. Furthermore, we develop a better lower bound. We prove\nthat, for general m, no deterministic online scheduling algorithm\ncan be bettern than 1.852-competitive.</p>\n\n<p>(From a STOC '97 paper by Susanne Albers)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
