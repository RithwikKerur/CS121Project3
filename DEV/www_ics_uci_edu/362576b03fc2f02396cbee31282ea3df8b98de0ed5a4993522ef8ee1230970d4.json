Berkeley\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn a previous article I asked:\n\nDoes a non-trivial knot in R^3 necessarily have four collinear points?\n\nI now know the status of this question.  The answer is yes for knots\nin general position, where general position means everything but a closed\nset of measure zero in various reasonable spaces of knot embeddings.\nThis was proved in a paper by Morton and Mond in 1980.  As often happens,\nhowever, someone else had the same basic ideas in 1933.\n\nI can prove the statement for all C^1 knots, which I think suffices in this\ncontext in which this question arose.  I'm still interested in the general\ncase, especially for wild knots.\n\nHere is why a knot must have three collinear points:  Suppose that for\na point P there does not exist Q and R collinear with it on the knot.\nThen for every point Q, we may join P and Q by a chord, and the union\nof the chords is evidently an embedded disk with the knot as boundary.\nTherefore the knot is trivial.\n---\nGreg\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
