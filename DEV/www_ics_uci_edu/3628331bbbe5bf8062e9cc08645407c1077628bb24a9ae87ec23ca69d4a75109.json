Bartal, S. Leonardi, A.\nMarchetti-Spaccamela, J. Sgall, and L. Stougie, 7th <i>SODA</i>,\n1995, pp. 95-103.) \n\n<p>We consider a version of multiprocessor scheduling with the\nspecial feature that jobs may be rejected for a certain penalty. An\ninstanace of the problem is given by m identical parallel machines\nand a set of <i>n</i> jobs, each job characterized by a processing\ntime and a penalty. In the on-line version the jobs arrive one by\none and we have to schedule or reject a job before we have any\ninformation about future jobs. The objective is to minimize the\nmakespan of the schedule for accepted jobs plus the sum of the\npenalties of rejected jobs.</p>\n\n<p>The main result is a 1+phi = 2.618 competitive algorithm for the\non-line version of the problem, where phi is the golden ratio. A\nmatching lower bound show that this is the best possible algorithm\nworking for all <i>m</i>. For fixed <i>m</i> we give improved\nbounds, in particular for <i>m</i> = 2 we give an optimal phi =\n1.618 competitive algorithm.</p>\n\n<p>For the off-line problem we present a fully polynomial\napproximation scheme for fixed <i>n</i> and an approximation\nalgorithm which runs in time O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) for arbitrary\n<i>m</i> and guarantees 2 - 1/<i>m</i> approximation ratio.</p>\n\n<p>This talk will focus on the first two results of this paper.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
