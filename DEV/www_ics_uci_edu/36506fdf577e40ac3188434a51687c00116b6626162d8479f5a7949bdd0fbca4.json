Durand: \"Re: Seiwald Q &amp; A\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<!-- body=\"start\" -->\n<pre>\nI'll try to explain the notion behind \"GET for EDIT\" cookies a little\nsince both Jim and David's responses showed that my initial explanation\nleft a bit to be desired.\n\nMe:\n\n| &gt;&gt;1.  A fundamental component of \"GET for EDIT\" has to be a cookie that\n| &gt;&gt;represents any stored context in the document server that needs to be\n| &gt;&gt;reunited with the document on checkin.  Most, if not all, SCM systems\n| &gt;&gt;are aware of their users' activity and use this awareness to keep users\n| &gt;&gt;from stomping on each other's work.\n| &gt;\n\nJim:\n\n| &gt;I think that use of cookies might be necessary in an implementation.\n| &gt;However, I suspect that you can maybe do it all with only MD5\n| &gt;authentication (i.e., only knowing the user).\n\nDavid:\n\n| I'm not sure of the role for the cookie in this (just call me dense (later\n| on in this mail I guess why you might use one)). But the reservation and\n| context establishment should be handled by LOCK. If a server requires\n| special reservation for editing, it's the client's responsibility to obtain\n| a lock on the file before doing a PUT. If the client already has a cached\n| copy, a \"conditional GET\" based on the version at the server might be\n| useful.\n|\n| I think decoupling the access control aspects (LOCKing and so forth) from\n| the GET/PUT operations gives us a lot more generality, extremely easily. I\n| don't see any situation where \"get for edit\" is really different from \"LOCK\n| resource for writing\" followed by GET. If the client has a local copy, the\n| GET could even be conditional on the version they have being a leaf (though\n| this would not be a requirement). Then we might even be able to PUT a few\n| times before releasing the lock!\n|\n| Attempts to PUT without a needed lock could bounce on servers that need or\n| want to enforce such a discipline on their clients.\n\nMe again:\n\nLocking (\"reservations\") can be handled by LOCK, I quite agree.  But\nSCM systems don't hang all their context on a lock: they hang it on the\n\"checkout\".  That's when the user tells the system, \"I'll be changing\nthis here document,\" and the system records that fact for the day when\nthe user says, \"Uh, here's that document I changed.\" The SCM system uses\nthis context to keep track of the dozens (thousands?) of users out there,\nall trying to change the same set of documents (but invariable all\nstarting with different revisions of those documents).  \n\nNot all SCM systems require a lock before checking in documents, and\nsome acquire that lock automatically, so many PUTs are likely to happen\nin the absense of a LOCK.  But _all_ SCM systems (except CVS) require\nsome sort of checkout (locking or non-locking) before checkin.  Now you\ncould fudge it, and by remembering the URL and revision do a paired\ncheckout/checkin to establish the required context.  But this defeats\na feature that all modern SCM systems boast: tracking user activity.\nThey have this feature because users don't remember what they're doing,\nand they certainly don't remember what other people are doing.  Half\nthe job of SCM systems (and by extension, version aware web servers) is\nto keep track of who is doing what to what, just to remind everyone\ninvolved.  Those scenarios I cooked up (where Joe and Jane keep stepping\non each other) weren't just from my past experience: they were from my\npast week's experience.\n\nOnly one user can LOCK a file.  If the context is established on LOCK\nthen there will be only one context per document, precluding Joe and\nJane from finding out that they're doctoring the same text.\n\nNormally SCM systems have a tight association between the checkout\ncontext and the checked-out file, because often there is no way to work\n\"outside\" of the SCM system.  But if the SCM system is the backend of\na version-aware web server, with the actual work happening in \"stateless\"\nweb clients, then that context must be represented by a cookie.\n\nThe cookie belongs to the underlying SCM system; whether it is an MD5\nhash of the document contents, some cryptic string churned up from bowels\nof the SCM database, or \"allworkandnoplaymakesjohnnyadullboy\" is not\nHTTP's or a Web authoring tool's business.  They just have to keep it\nassociated with the checked-out document so that it can be reunited with\nthe checkout context at checkin time.\n\nThis cookie is the single most important component of distributed web\nauthoring, IMHO.\n\nChristopher\n----\nChristopher Seiwald     Perforce Software\twww.perforce.com       \n<a href=\"mailto:seiwald@perforce.com\">seiwald@perforce.com</a>    f-f-f-fast SCM\t\t1-510-865-8720\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0115.html\">Yaron Goland: \"RE: Microsoft Feature Support List (V 0.1, ALPHA, 8/26/96)\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0113.html\">David G.
