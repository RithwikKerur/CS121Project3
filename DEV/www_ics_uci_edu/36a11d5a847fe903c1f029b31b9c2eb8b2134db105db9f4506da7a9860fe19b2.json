Due to heterogeneity of the traffic, \na network based on the packet switching technology may provide a \nmore flexible framework and allow a simpler architecture and significant \ncost savings.  Those have been the experiences with the wireline networks, \nwhich have moved recently to such an integrated architecture.  \nBy having all data in a packetized form, there is no need to maintain \na different type of network for specialized applications, \nsuch as a circuit-switched network for voice telephony, \nwhich may require different types of equipment and administrative overhead.  \nIn addition, there is the possibility of using statistical multiplexing \nto increase the utilization of often-limited transmission resources.  \nSince network resources are not pre-assigned in a packet-switched network, \ndifferent users or flows can share the network resources and higher \nutilization of may be achieved. In particular, networks based on the \nInternet Protocol (IP) have begun to gain momentum as the platform of \nchoice due to their ubiquity and scalability. \n<br>\nThere are significant hurdles to overcome, however, in building a \npacket-switched wireless network that can serve all types of traffic.  \nNot only must the communication link be shared among many users and flows \nwhile providing adequate QoS, the sharing must be done over the wireless \nchannel which is prone to frequent errors and sometimes prolonged outages.  \nTransport of packet data traffic over the wireless channel has received a \nlot of attention lately due to increasing use of the Internet from \nwireless devices.  However, much of the work has dealt with \ndelay-insensitive data, as most researchers have assumed that \ndelay-sensitive applications such as voice telephony will continue to be \nserved using a separate circuit-switched network dedicated to such \napplications. To make the idea of extending the packet-switched framework \nto the wireless network more feasible, there remains much work to be \ndone on how to efficiently serve different types of data over a medium \nthat is relatively scarce and fraught with errors. \nIn this resesarch project, \nwe focus on the transport of real-time packets such as \nthose from voice over IP (VoIP) applications which may make up an \nimportant subset of traffic over \nthe future packet-switched wireless networks.\n</body>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
