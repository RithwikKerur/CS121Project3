To do this you will be using <a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy\"\nclass=\"external text\"\ntitle=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy\"\nrel=\"nofollow\">pretty good privacy (PGP)</a> to encrypt and/or sign\nthe email correspondences with \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pflynn/\">your Class Reader, Patrick Flynn</a>.\n</p><p>As we've gone over in class, encryption is the process of\nsecuring communication and doing so involves just a few easy steps.\n</p>\n<a name=\"Instructions\" id=\"Instructions\"></a><h2> <span\nclass=\"mw-headline\">Instructions</span></h2>\n<p>The first step is to determine the <a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system\" class=\"external\ntext\" title=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system\"\nrel=\"nofollow\">operating system (OS)</a> that you will be using.\nOnce you've completed that difficult task, it's on to using\nThunderbird to encrypt your emails. You can of course use other\nclients to encrypt your mail, in which case, you may ignore the steps\ndescribed below. The steps below assume that you are using Thunderbird.\n\n</p>\n<a name=\"Thunderbird\" id=\"Thunderbird\"></a><h3> <span\nclass=\"mw-headline\">Thunderbird</span></h3>\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/\"\nclass=\"external text\"\ntitle=\"http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/\"\nrel=\"nofollow\">Thunderbird</a> will \nallow you (with a bit of\ntinkering) to \"securely\" send emails, through the use of an\nencryption algorithm, to your friend \"Bob.\" For this assignment, \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pflynn/\">your Class Reader, Patrick Flynn</a>,\nwill be the recipient, of course.\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Step 1:</b> Download <a\nhref=\"http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/\"\nclass=\"external text\"\ntitle=\"http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/\"\nrel=\"nofollow\">Thunderbird</a> and install it.\nTo configure Thunderbird for your email service, \nfollow the appropriate instructions below (or use those for your\nemail provider):\n\n<ul><li>\n<a\nhref=\"http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=180189\">\nGmail Thunderbird setup instructions</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/thunderbird.html\">\nUCI Thunderbird setup instructions</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/email/thunderbird_setup.php\">ICS\nThunderbird setup instructions</a>.\n\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><b>Step 2:</b> Download a PGP program.\n<ul><li><b>Windows Users:</b> Download <a\nhref=\"http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html\" class=\"external text\"\ntitle=\"http://www.gpg4win.org/download.html\"\nrel=\"nofollow\">Gpg4win</a>.\n</li><li><b>Mac Users:</b> Download <a\nhref=\"http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/\" class=\"external text\"\ntitle=\"http://macgpg.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mac GPG</a>\n\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><b>Step 3:</b> \n<ul><li><b>Windows Users:</b> Follow the on screen instructions for\ninstalling Gpg4win.  When the \"Choose Components\" box shows up, all\nyou need to select is <b>GnuPG</b> and <b>GPA</b>.  Optionally, you\ncan select the manuals at the bottom if you want to read more about\nencryption or keep them for future reference.  Remember the location\nyou install GPG in as you will need it shortly.\n</li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n<img alt=\"Gpg4win Components\" src=\"Gpg4win_Install.png\">\n</p>\n<dl><dd><ul><li><b>Mac Users:</b> Install Mac GPG.\n\n</li></ul>\n</dd></dl>\n<ul><li><b>Step 4:</b> Download the <a\nhref=\"http://enigmail.mozdev.org/download/index.php\" class=\"external\ntext\" title=\"http://enigmail.mozdev.org/download/index.php\"\nrel=\"nofollow\">Enigmail</a> extension for Thunderbird and save it\nsomewhere.\n</li><li><b>Step 5:</b> Once you've downloaded Enigmail, in\nThunderbird open Tools -&gt; Add-ons -&gt; Install, and then choose\nthe Enigmail extension file.\n</li><li><b>Step 6:</b> When you've restarted Thunderbird with\nEnigmail installed, you will see an OpenPGP menu item. Open it and go\nto Preferences. There you'll find a dialog to point to your GnuPGP\nbinary. Click Browse. On my machine, GPG was installed under Program\nFiles\\GNU\\GnuPG\\gpg2.exe.  For Mac, it's most likely in\n/usr/local/bin/gpg.  In order for other people to send you encrypted\nmessages, they will need your public key.  There are a number of <a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_server_%28cryptographic%29\"\nclass=\"external text\"\ntitle=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_server_%28cryptographic%29\"\nrel=\"nofollow\">keyservers</a> which host such public keys, but for\nour purposes we will be using pgp.mit.edu.  Go to the\n<b>Keyserver</b> tab and make sure pgp.mit.edu is listed in the\ndialogue box.  If you don't see a <b>Keyserver</b> tab, click on\n<b>Expert Settings</b>.\n\n</li><li><b>Step 7:</b> Now you'll need to generate your\npublic/private key pair. From the OpenPGP menu item, choose Key\nManagement. From the Generate menu, choose New Key Pair. Choose the\nemail address you want to create a key for, and set a passphrase. You\ncan set the expiration term for your key or set it to never expire,\nit's your choice. Hit the \"Generate Key\" button, and relax - it can\ntake a few minutes.\n</li><li><b>Step 8:</b> When it's done, you have the chance to\ngenerate a \"revocation certificate.\" This certificate can invalidate\nyour public key just in case your private key is ever compromised. Go\nahead and get your revocation certificate and save it.\n</li><li><b>Step 9:</b> Publish your key by selecting it in the key\nmanagement window, clicking the <b>Keyserver</b> tab and selecting\n<b>Upload Public Keys</b>.\n</li></ul>\n<a name=\"Sending_Encrypted.2FSigned_Emails\"\nid=\"Sending_Encrypted.2FSigned_Emails\"></a><h3> <span\nclass=\"mw-headline\">Sending Encrypted/Signed Emails</span></h3>\n\n<p>Now that you've followed these instructions,\nit's time to let \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pflynn/\">your Class Reader, Patrick Flynn</a>,\nknow that you are capable of sending encrypted messages.\nOf course, this process should be done from your email account\nfor which the public key is published. \n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Step 1:</b> Before you can send an encrypted message to \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pflynn/\">your Class Reader, Patrick Flynn</a>,\nyou must obtain his public key.  To get this, open the Key\nManagement window, click Keyserver, and select <b>Search for\nKeys</b>.  Type in his email address \n(pflynn@ics.uci.edu) then click search. You will find his public key there,\nimport it. Just to make sure, his public key id is 82483CCA; you\ncan check it out if there are duplicated names.\nYou can also find his PGP public key from\nthe web site for\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pflynn/\">your Class Reader, Patrick Flynn</a>.\n</li><li><b>Step 2:</b> Compose an email. Just to avoid confusion,\nhere is the format of the email you will have to make. \n<ul><li>Make the title as Homework8\n</li><li>For the content, please wish \nPatrick a great new year, \nand include your name and student ID as it appears in the class roster.\n\n</li></ul>\n</li><li><b>Step 3:</b> Click the OpenPGP tab, and select both\n<b>Encrypt</b> and <b>Sign</b> message.\n</li><li><b>Step 4:</b> Click Send. You will then be prompted to\nselect the recipient's key. Do so, and click OK.  You may be prompted\nwith questions about sending in plaintext or HTML, choose plaintext.\n</li><li><b>Step 5:</b> You're done!  \nNow you know how to send encrypted messages.\n</li></ul>\n\n<hr>\nThis page is derived from an assignment by Chris Bronk at Rice\nUniversity.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
