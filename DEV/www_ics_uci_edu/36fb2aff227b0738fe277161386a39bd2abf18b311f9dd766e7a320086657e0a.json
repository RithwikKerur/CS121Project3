By translating this sequence to a set of points in the plane, a\nrollercoaster can be defined as a polygonal path for which every maximal\nsub-path, with positive- or negative-slope edges, has at least three points.\nGiven a sequence of distinct real numbers, the rollercoaster problem asks for\na maximum-length (not necessarily contiguous) subsequence that is a\nrollercoaster. It was conjectured that every sequence of n distinct real\nnumbers contains a rollercoaster of length at least n/2 for n > 7, while the\nbest known lower bound is \u00e2\u201e\u00a6(n/ log n). In this paper we prove this\nconjecture. Our proof is constructive and implies a linear-time algorithm for\ncomputing a rollercoaster of this length. Extending the O(n log n)-time\nalgorithm for computing a longest increasing subsequence, we show how to\ncompute a maximum-length rollercoaster within the same time bound. A\nmaximumlength rollercoaster in a permutation of {1, . . . , n} can be\ncomputed in O(n log log n) time. \nThe search for rollercoasters was motivated by orthogeodesic point-set\nembedding of caterpillars. A caterpillar is a tree such that deleting the\nleaves gives a path, called the spine. A top-view caterpillar is one of\ndegree 4 such that the two leaves adjacent to each vertex lie on opposite\nsides of the spine. As an application of our result on rollercoasters, we are\nable to find a planar drawing of every n-node top-view caterpillar on every\nset of (25/3)*n points in the plane, such that each edge is an orthogonal\npath with one bend. This improves the previous best known upper bound on the\nnumber of required points, which is O(n log n). We also show that such a\ndrawing can be obtained in linear time, provided that the points are given in\nsorted order. \n\n<p>\nPaper by Therese Biedl, Ahmad Biniaz, Robert Cummings, Anna Lubiw, Florin\nManea, Dirk Nowotka, Jeffrey Shallit\n</body></html>\n\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
