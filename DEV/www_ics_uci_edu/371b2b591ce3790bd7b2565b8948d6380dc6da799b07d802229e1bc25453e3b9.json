Nahiduzzaman<br>\r\nOffice: DBH 4243\r\n <br>\r\nOffice Hours: Thu 5:00 - 6:00 PM\r\n <br>\r\nEmail: <tt> kaisernahid@gmail.com </tt>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Meeting Places and Times</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nLecture will be held MWF 10:00-10:50 in SSL 228.\r\nYou are responsible for anything said in class, including\r\nclass announcements. If you have to miss lecture for any\r\nreason, please ask one of your classmates to fill you\r\nin on what you missed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are two lab sections for this class. Each lab section has\r\nfour scheduled hours in the lab.\r\nDuring these times, you have a guaranteed seat in  the lab.\r\nNote, however, you only have priority over\r\nother students if you are working on class work (i.e. not\r\nplaying games).\r\nKaiser will be available in the lab during these times\r\nto answer questions.\r\nThis is an ideal opportunity to get some help with your\r\nlab homework in front of a computer.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are several department labs which you can use\r\nfor working on your lab assignments.\r\nInformation about the locations and hours of the\r\nlabs can be found at\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab\">\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab </a>.\r\nKeep in mind that some of these labs may be reserved for other\r\nclasses during the day, so you may not have first priority\r\nto these machines at all times.\r\nIt is possible that the labs will be\r\nvery crowded on the day an assignment is due.\r\nIt is your responsibility to take this into account\r\nas I can not accept\r\ncrowded labs as an excuse for late lab assigments.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Obtaining Assistance</h3>\r\nThe best way to get your questions answered is by coming\r\nto lecture, office hours or lab and asking them there.\r\nIn general,\r\nif I'm not busy with something else, I am happy to answer\r\nshort questions while I am in my office, so feel free to\r\nstop by during other times in the week.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll email with questions about course material should be sent to the\r\nfollowing email address:\r\n<A href=\"mailto:ics22-questions@ics.uci.edu\">ics22-questions@ics.uci.edu</A>.\r\nThis is an alias for the instructor and the TA.  It ensures\r\nthat we both see your message and the response.  It also gives you better\r\nturnaround time.\r\n<LI>Please also include the following information:\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> The string \"ICS 22:\" at the beginning of the subject line\r\n<LI> Your name\r\n<LI> Your student number\r\n</UL>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you are experiencing difficulties in the lab with the\r\nequipment, let the lab attendant know.\r\nIf they can not solve the problem, they will contact\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\n<H3>Course Announcements</H3>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>Course announcements will be sent via email to all students enrolled\r\nin the class, at their official UCI email address.\r\n<LI>\r\n<A  href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/s11/16010/\">Click here</A> for the\r\narchive of these messages.\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Assignments</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Lab assignments </b>\r\nwill be due approximately every two weeks at Friday 7PM.\r\nPlease see the <a href=\"projectintro.html\">\r\nIntroduction to the Projects </a> for instructions on handing in assignments\r\nand policies on late assignments.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Weekly quizes: </b>\r\nI will give a very short weekly quiz at the beginning of class every\r\nMonday. Since May 30 is a holiday, we will have a quiz the following\r\nWednesday, June 1, instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quizes will last approximately 10 minutes and will be given out\r\nat the beginning of lecture. They will cover material from the preceding week.\r\nIn determining your course score, I will drop the lowest two quiz scores.\r\nHowever, these dropped scores are intended to cover any missed quizes\r\nfor whatever reason you need to miss a quiz. This includes any medical\r\nproblems, personal issues or school-related events.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI will grade the quizes and Kaiser will grade the lab assignments.\r\nIf you have questions regarding grading, please see the person who\r\ngraded that particular item.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Text</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe have one required text for this course.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<em> Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 4th. edition.</em>, by\r\nMichael Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nYou may also find it useful to purchase a Java reference book\r\nif you do not already have one. Different styles suit different\r\npeople, so I will leave it up to you to select your own.\r\n<h3>Course Structure</h3>\r\n\r\nThe grading criteria for the course is:\r\n<ul>\r\nAttendance 4%<br>\r\nLab assignments 40%<br>\r\nQuizes 30%<br>\r\nFinal 25%<br>\r\nCompleting the Course Evaluation 1%<br>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that there is a tiny bit of credit given for completing the course evaluation towards the\r\nend of the quarter. It is\r\navailable through <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/\"> EEE </a> and is\r\nusually released a couple  weeks from the end of the quarter.\r\nIf enough students complete the evaluation then I have access to the list of students\r\nwho completed the evaluation. However, I do not see any evaluation results until the\r\nquarter is over and grades have been turned in. Even after the quarter when I do\r\nsee the evaluation results, they are completely anonymous. Thus, there is no risk\r\nto you in being completely honest in your evaluation. I take these evaluations very\r\nseriously and use them to improve my teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H3>Missed Final Exam Policy</H3>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> If you miss the final exam and do not have a valid reason, you will receive\r\na score of 0 on the exam.\r\n<LI> The following policy applies if you miss the final exam for a valid reason.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>\r\nThere are only two classes of valid reasons for missing the final exam:\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>  An unforeseeable emergency, such as a medical emergency.\r\nIn such cases I will ask for documentation.\r\n<LI> An absence from an exam due to a foreseeable circumstance\r\nthat I have approved in advance.\r\n</OL>\r\n<LI>\r\nA work conflict is NOT a valid reason for missing the final exam.\r\nThe examination times\r\nare announced at the beginning of the quarter, so there is plenty of\r\ntime to plan your work schedule.\r\n<LI> If you wait until after the exam to get a foreseeable excuse approved,\r\nand it is not approved,\r\nyou will receive a grade of zero (0) on the exam.\r\n<LI> If I accept your reason for missing the final exam, at my option I may\r\neither (1) give you a makeup exam or (2) assign your grade on the basis\r\nof the remaining course work that you did not miss.\r\n<LI> If I give a makeup exam, I may give it less weight\r\nthan announced on the course web page.\r\n</UL>\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>\r\n    <p>The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established an academic honesty policy. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">Read it.</a></p>\r\n    <p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n    <h4>Guidelines to avoid plagarism:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>Do not look at another person's code.</b>\r\n      Instead you should prefer to discuss the problem in plain English.\r\n      This helps you to communicate clearly, practice technical jargon as it applies to your problem, and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior different from what you expect.\r\n      <li><b>Do not write down the solution in your notes.</b>\r\n      It is perfectly fine (and encouraged) to collborate on work.\r\n      Working in a group is a rewarding experience, and definitely a necessary skill in any professional career.\r\n      The collaboration can include drawing diagrams and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard.\r\n      However, you should avoid writing the solution in your notes.\r\n      It is very useful to rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you solve it again on your own.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>We expect that:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among yourselves.</b> Making sure that others follow these guidelines will help to ensure that they don't pass off your work as their own.</p>\r\n      <li><b>Your work honestly represents your efforts.</b> The entire purpose of obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of skills and experience that will help you later on. If you do not perform the work yourself, then you have cheated yourself out of the education. Employers in our field can (and do) screen applicants for skills and knowledge. You will perform poorly (and discredit UCI) if you do not practice now by doing your own work.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>Trust, but Verify</h4>\r\n    <p>We also recognize that trust is a two-way street. We trust that you will follow these guidelines, and we can verify that trust by using sophisticated plagarism detection software. Not only does this software contain a knowledge base of all current assignments, but it also remembers all past assignments. It can pattern-match over code structure as well as code text. The effort required to cheat this system is less than the effort to do the assignment yourself, so don't try it!</p>\r\n    <p>If you are repeating this course, you are also not allowed to use past work. Do not deprive a coding partner of the learning experience by providing answers without thought. Do not deprive yourself of the opportunity to reinforce concepts you may not have fully gotten the first time. Turning in past work will be detectable, and considered plagarism as it defeats the purpose of the assignments. Start yourself completely afresh.</p>\r\n    <p>As I will be verifying your work, so can you verify my work. Attend lectures, read ahead in the book, and watch me like a hawk so that I don't broadcast inconsistent information.</p>\r\n  </div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\u0000", "encoding": "ascii"}
