There were 14 meeting\nparticipants, including members of the Internet Engineering Task Force\n(IETF) HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Working Group, the World Wide Web\nConsortium (W3C), the document management community, software configuration\nmanagement companies, distributed web authoring tool vendors and\nresearchers, and the academic hypertext versioning community.  The main\nobjective of this meeting was to provide a forum where people interested in\nfostering interoperability between distributed web authoring applications\ncould meet, exchange information about the current state of the art and\npractice, identify key interoperability issues, and formulate an agenda for\nachieving interoperability.\n\nThe meeting began with a presentation by Jim Whitehead, U.C. Irvine on the\nhistory of distributed authoring on the WWW, on the purpose of the\ndistributed authoring working group, and on the purpose of the Working\nGroup on Versioning and Configuration Management of World Wide Web Content.\nRon Fein, Microsoft, next gave a presentation on collaborative authoring\nand WWW features in Microsoft Word.  A presentation by Henrik Frystyk\nNielsen, W3C, on distributed authoring and his vision of a unified PUT\nmodel, finished the morning session. The afternoon began with a\npresentation by Dave Long, America Online, on AOLpress and AOLserver, which\nwas followed by a presentation by Andy Schulert, Microsoft, on FrontPage.\nWhitehead next led discussion on the goal of the working group, the\nsponsorship of the working group, and criteria for completion.  At the end\nof the day, the group discussed what they considered to be key\ninteroperability issues, and developed a list of activities and\ndeliverables to be produced by the working group.\n\nKey Results\n\n1. The working group adopted as its goal: Enable distributed web authoring\ntools to be broadly interoperable.\n\n2. Create a task-oriented list of scenarios which interoperable distributed\nauthoring tools should be able to perform.  Keith Dawson, Atria, is the\neditor of this document.\n\n3. Create a list which collates the \"key functionality\" among\nAOLpress/AOLserver, FrontPage, Word, as well as other distributed authoring\ntools.  Dave Long, America Online, is the editor of this document.\n\nThe working group also identified some areas for future work:\n\n1. Criteria for completion of the group's work were discussed, and need to\nbe clearly described in writing.\n\n2. The working group was tentatively interested in seeking sponsorship by\nthe W3C. However, before the group is officially sponsored, members needs\nto know the intellectual property rights implications of such sponsorship.\n\n3. There should be a reinvestigation of work previously performed by Murray\nMaloney on standard LINK REL and REV tags.\n\n4. There should be an investigation by the versioning and configuration\nmanagement group into the utility of entity tags (etags) for performing\nversioning.\n\nDetailed meeting notes, a list of participants, a final agenda for the\nmeeting, and slides from the meeting are available at URL:\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/sanmateo/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/sanmateo/</a>\n\nFinally, the working group would like to thank Dave Long of America Online\nfor arranging the conference room at AOL Productions, and for his\nin-meeting support.\n\n- Jim Whitehead &lt;<a href=\"mailto:ejw@ics.uci.edu\">ejw@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0104.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Use of etags in versioning\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0102.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"San Mateo meeting notes\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
