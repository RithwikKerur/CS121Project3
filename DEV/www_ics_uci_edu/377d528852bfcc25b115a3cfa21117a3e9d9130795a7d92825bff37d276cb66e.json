The neighbourhood function provides useful\ninformation for graphs such as the structure of XML documents, OODBs,\nWeb graphs, telephone (caller-callee) records, citations graphs, to\nname a few. It is very expensive to compute the neighbourhood function\nexactly on large graphs. Instead, we propose an algorithm using\napproximation counting. Our approximation runs with any amount of\navailable memory, providing excellent scalability to arbitrarily large\ngraphs. By applying our approximation algorithm on large real and\nsynthetic graphs, we find that our approximation algorithm is\nsignificantly faster and more accurate than the best prior\napproximation scheme. Our approximation runs over 400 times faster\nthan the exact computation (with less than a 10% error). \n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
