Remember that\nthe main point is <I>finding</I> the answer, not the answer itself.  You\nwon&#39;t get much from the assignment if you let someone else do the work.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Most people who become experts at using a\nparticular application program get their expertise through experience, not\n(primarily) by reading the documentation.  Moreover, that experience comes\nnot only from working on specific tasks but also from experimentation, or\n&quot;playing around&quot;--trying different commands or actions to see\nwhat results.  You should take this opportunity to do the same.</FONT></P>\n<OL TYPE=\"1\">\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Which tool(s) do vector (line) graphics? \nWhich edit bitmaps?</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>What graphics file formats (GIF, JPEG, BMP,\netc.) do these tools read?

How does the size change if you choose\nother resolutions, other bit depths, and other file formats?  What&#39;s\nthe smallest size at which you can save your image without losing noticeable\nquality?  What&#39;s the smallest size that may lose quality but still keeps\nthe image recognizable?

You will also plot the two sequences in a line graph\nand write a paragraph or two describing your results.  In addition, you\nwill compress one of the sequences by varying the quantization (i.e., by\nusing fewer digits of precision), again plotting and commenting on the results.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(c.1)</B>  First, download the file </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10a/hw/CompressionMaster.xls\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/10a/hw/CompressionMaster.xls</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\n.  Then open the file in Excel.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Follow the instructions in the file for identifying\nthe two columns of data you will work with.  (Everyone gets different data,\ndepending on their student ID; use the correct set or you won&#39;t get\ncredit.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Create a new spreadsheet with your name and\nother identifying information.  Copy into that spreadsheet your own two\ncolumns of data from the CompressionMaster spreadsheet.  Mark those columns\n&quot;Original Data A&quot; and &quot;Original Data B.&quot;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(c.2)</B>  Do these three steps for both\nA and B:</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>-- In an adjacent column, produce a delta-encoded\nversion of the sequence (i.e., compute just the differences between each\nitem and its predecessor).  (Selecting the cells in the new column and using\n&quot;Fill Down&quot; from the Edit menu will save you from having to type\nrepetitively similar formulas.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>-- Calculate the compression rate (the number\nof ASCII symbols in the compressed data divided by the number of ASCII symbols\nin the uncompressed data).  (Cutting and pasting to use &quot;Word Count&quot;\nfrom the &quot;Tools&quot; menu of Microsoft Word is better than counting\nby hand.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>-- Plot a chart of the sequence, using a line\ngraph with no markers.  Be sure to include an appropriate heading.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(c.3)</B>  Now, do this additional task,\njust for the A data:  Create a new column, dividing each value by 1000.\n (The original data was in millimeters; your new column is in meters.) \nThis new column will have three digits to the right of the decimal point.\n To vary the quantization, create three <I>more</I> columns:  One with two\ndigits to the right, one with one digit to the right, and one with no digits\nto the right of the decimal point.  The Round function helps here.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As before, calculate the compression rates\nfor each of the three reduced-precision columns.  Then produce a bar graph\nshowing the relative sizes of the four representations.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Next, plot the original data (in meters) against\neach of the three reduced-precision versions (i.e., produce three plots).\n Be sure to label the graphs appropriately.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(c.4)</B>  Finally, write a couple of paragraphs\ndescribing your results.  What you write should provide answers and explanations\nto the following questions, at least:  Did both sequences compress equally\nwell using delta encoding?  Could you have predicted the results from looking\nat the graphs?  How much reduction of precision was possible before the\nquality of the data degraded significantly (i.e., at what point could you\ndetect a difference between the original and compressed data)?</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Print these answers, marking them clearly\n&quot;part <B>(c)</B>.&quot;</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(d)</B>  The class and the text describe\nrun-length encoding (RLE).  Find three images of flags on the Web:  one\nthat will compress very well using RLE, one that will compress very poorly\nusing RLE, and one in the middle.  Justify your choices in a few brief sentences\n(i.e., say why the good one&#39;s good, and so on).  (Hint:  The study of\nflags is called vexillology, so using that as a search term will point to\nlots of flag images.)  Download the images from the Web and place them in\nyour report, adjusting them so they&#39;re uniformly sized and neatly aligned.\n (The graphics tools from the first part of this assignment should help.)\n Mark this all &quot;part <B>(d)</B>.&quot;</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(e)</B>  Below are three images.  Image\nA is the original; the other two are compressed using lossy techniques.\n One used a reduced quantization; the other used coarser sampling.  Which\nis which (with a sentence explaining your answer)?  Print it and mark it\nas usual.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"Asst_6_Images_Compress_files/Picture_114.gif\" WIDTH=430 HEIGHT=123 ALT=\"\">\n</P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(f)</B>  Below are three more images. \nWhich would compress best using delta encoding?

Thus, &quot;Mississippi&quot; could\nbe compressed to &quot;Miss[2,3]ippi&quot; (without compressing single-letter\npieces).  Another way to represent this same kind of compression is with\na dictionary:</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">#\niss</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>  (This single-entry dictionary\nsays to substitute &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">iss</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>&quot;\nfor the shorter &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">#</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>&quot;)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>&#160;&#160; </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">M##ippi</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Even the above short example saves one character\nif we ignore white space.

You&#39;re\nallowed to have multiple entries in the dictionary; that might help in some\ncases.  We&#39;ll share the best ones in class.
