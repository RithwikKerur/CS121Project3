He must have \r\nbeen born no later than around 1850 and probably earlier.\r\n     \r\n He had at least three sons and three daughters David Arieh (1871), Meir,\r\nShlomo, Gitl, Beila and Sara. Sara married a Mr NADEL. Shlomo had a son \r\nMoshe who was in Paris and was the editor of the Yiddish newspaper, &quot;Parise \r\nHaint&quot; (Paris Today) before the war. Moshe's son Wladek lives in Paris and \r\nhas at least two sons.\r\n     \r\nDavid Arieh (1871-1942) married Shoshana Zylbertrest (1873-1942) and seven \r\nchildren Benzion 1895-1976 (Melbourne) married Pola and had one son Isaac; \r\nMoshe (1900-1919); Anka (1903-1942) who married Benzion KOHN and had a son \r\nPinchas; Simon -or Ziskind Alexander - (1906-1959) married Esther WOLF in \r\nMelbourne and had two children Alan and Sue (KIMMEL); Sara (1907-1912); \r\nLodzia - Leonora leah - (1908-1942) married Mordechai Mietek Zyskind and \r\nhad a son Marek.\r\n     \r\nShoshana Zilbertrest was the sister of Ralph Silver (New York), father of \r\nEsther HOVEY (UCLA) and Meir Silver (New Jersey). Shoshana had a brother \r\nHersch Zylbertrest whose son Sam (in Paris) has given me a very detailed \r\nfamily tree of his side of the family. &quot;Extensive&quot; is an understatement.\r\n     \r\nSam married Tamara and had a daughter (also Tamara) with whom I have stayed \r\nin Paris and a son Harvey.\r\n     \r\nThe youngest child was my father Akiwa Meir (Mark) born in 1915 and \r\nthankfully still going strong. Mark married Raya Bak daughter of Shlomo and \r\nGhenia (Shaina Leah  GOLDES) born in Odessa 7.11.1917. Shlomo had a very \r\ncolorful history jumping from the Czar's white army to the Red Army in 1917 \r\nbecoming a district governor before going to Warsaw in 1921.\r\n     \r\nThe son of Isaac Leib Bak, he lived at Gesia 7 in Warsaw but with his wife \r\nGhenia had run factories and businesses in a number of places in Poland. \r\nShlomo\r\nhad two brothers and two sisters Chiel, Henoch, Faiga (m FRIDMAN) and Hinda \r\n(m SCARLAT). Shlomo escaped to Argentina before the war, my mother Raya \r\ncame to Australia with her brother in law Benzion his wife Pola and little \r\nson Isaac  and was reunited with her husband of one year, but her sister \r\nAda and mother Ghenia were left behind and murdered by the nazis.\r\n     \r\nShlomo's brother Chiel had three children Fela (m GRANATMAN, Israel) and \r\nhave two daughters; and Jacob and Nathan. Henoch's son Wladek (senior \r\nofficer in Polish army until 1968) married Ola and had two children Andrzej \r\n(New York) and Halinka (Melbourne).\r\n     \r\nTHE PRESENT GENERATION:\r\n     \r\nIn Melbourne, the three surviving sons of David Arieh - Ben Simon and Mark \r\n- created a new world with a total of (1+2+3 =6) children; 8 in the next \r\ngeneration (I am the last of the 6 to produce, so more can be expected in \r\nthe very immediate future)  and, so far, four in the next generation.\r\n     \r\nBen &amp; Pola\r\nIsaac married Rita: but no children\r\n     \r\nSimon &amp; Esther (Tusia)\r\nAlan married Barbara: two children in their 20s Simon and Julie \r\nSue  married Herb Kimmel: Zachary and Lara\r\n     \r\nMark &amp; Raya\r\nAnn married george Fink (Vienna, Melbourne Oxford Edinburgh): Daughter \r\nNaomi married Arik Agmon (Israel) daughter Leanne.

Stay tuned.\r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\nThe wedding was fabulous, the day was fabulous (30oC), the food was \r\nfabulous: \r\nentre - kangaroo, emu and wallaby party pies, cheese &amp; spinach pastries, \r\nsushi.\r\nmains - kangaroo fillets, chicken drumsticks in thai sauce, grilled baby \r\noctopus, \r\nsalads, spuds and pumpkin\r\ndessert - thickest ever richest ever chocolate wedding cake covered in wild \r\nberries.\r\n     \r\nIt was great. The &quot;bad boys back table&quot; was still raging when Asheley and I \r\nwent to bed at 4am.\r\n     \r\nAnd then we went to Brunswick Heads near Byron Bay in the north of New \r\nSouth \r\nWales for an eight day honeymoon. Beach, sun, river, fish, no phones, no \r\nemail. \r\nYahoo!\r\n     \r\nBelow is a little description of events by Steve Brook from an email he \r\nsent Rod and Helen. \r\n     \r\nDear Rod &amp; Helen . . .\r\n     \r\nMeni and I were at the wedding on New Year's Eve of David L. and Asheley \r\nJ. Since David is no ordinary mortal, and neither, presumably, is his \r\npartner, the event had to be quite extraordinary. And so it was. While a \r\nprofessional Marriage Celebrant was there, for he had to be in order to \r\nsign the papers, everything else was by Fellini.\r\n     \r\nThe ceremony was done by David and Asheley themselves, with no intervention \r\nfrom any kind of state or ecclesiastical authority, though there were nods \r\nin the direction of Jewish, Christian and animist beliefs. The couple stood \r\nunder a Jewish-style chupa, a wedding canopy, held up on sticks by four of \r\nthe guests. What distinguished this chupa from most others I have seen is \r\nthat it was made from a keffiyeh, a Palestinian head scarf.\r\n     \r\nThe symbolism was overpowering.\r\n     \r\nDavid began his contribution by thanking the Koori people for the use of \r\ntheir land. He said a great deal else besides, but I did not take notes. \r\nOne does not do that at weddings.\r\n     \r\nPeople sang songs, and poetry was recited, including Cavafy's &quot;Ithaka&quot;. A \r\ngreat benedictory poem, and I wish I had thought of that for my own two \r\nweddings . . .\r\n     \r\n[Meni tells me that this poem was read at Jackie Kennedy's funeral by her \r\nbereaved Jewish lover. So it gets around.]\r\n     \r\nMark, David's father, struggled with the fading light to read a biblical \r\nstory. Someone helped with a lighted mosquito candle.\r\n     \r\nAt a certain point David did the traditional stamping on the wineglass, to \r\nmingled shouts of &quot;Good luck!&quot; and &quot;Mazeltov!&quot;\r\n     \r\nThe speeches by friends and relations mentioned gay rights, shagging and \r\nhope for the future. And messages came from all over, including from the \r\nPalestinian Authority's representative in Australia, from John Pilger and \r\nfrom others in all continents.\r\n     \r\nThe freshly-married couple did the Wedding Waltz from &quot;The Jolson Story&quot;. \r\nSome of David's relations looked puzzled.\r\n     \r\nIt was an evening that could never be repeated. Meni said to me later that \r\nit was the most political wedding she had ever been to. I said that every \r\nwedding makes a political statement of some kind, even if the participants \r\nare unaware of it. But that was just me, being profound again. We both \r\nenjoyed ourselves immensely.\r\n     \r\nSteve\r\n     \r\nMelbourne\r\nJanuary 4 1998\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nFrom: DingoNet@compuserve.com at INTERNET\r\nTO: Moishe Miller\r\nSubject: It's a DOCTOR\r\nDate: 11/8/98 10:38 AM \r\n\r\n\r\nAsheley Jones and David Langsam (DnA)\r\n\r\nare ecstatic to announce the birth of their son\r\n\r\nDR ALEXANDER GEORGE LANGSAM\r\n\r\n(Dr Alecsander Shlomo ben David Arieh) \r\n\r\non November 9, 1998 (0055 Eastern Summer Time, 1355GMT8/11/98)\r\n\r\nat the Royal Women's Hospital \r\nMelbourne, Australia\r\n\r\nAlex is about 48-50 cms long and weighs about 3.2kg 7.5lb\r\n\r\nHe sends his best regards to all.\r\n\r\nMother Son and father are all very very very happy.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom:  DingoNet@compuserve.com\r\nSubject:  Chanuka & etc.\r\nPostedDate:  12/28/98 05:39:57 PM\r\nSendTo:  CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential\r\nDeliveredDate:  12/28/98 05:40:53 PM\r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n\r\ngood to hear from you again.

While a professional\r\nMarriage Celebrant was there, for he had to be in order to sign the papers,\r\neverything else was by Fellini.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ceremony was done by David and Asheley themselves, with no intervention\r\nfrom any kind of state or ecclesiastical authority, though there were nods\r\nin the direction of Jewish, Christian and animist beliefs. The couple stood\r\nunder a Jewish-style chupa, a wedding canopy, held up on sticks by four of\r\nthe guests. What distinguished this chupa from most others I have seen is\r\nthat it was made from a keffiyeh, a Palestinian head scarf.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe symbolism was overpowering.\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid began his contribution by thanking the Koori people for the use of\r\ntheir land. He said a great deal else besides, but I did not take notes. One\r\ndoes not do that at weddings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople sang songs, and poetry was recited, including Cavafy's \"Ithaka\". A\r\ngreat benedictory poem, and I wish I had thought of that for my own two\r\nweddings . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n[Meni tells me that this poem was read at Jackie Kennedy's funeral by her\r\nbereaved Jewish lover. So it gets around.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMark, David's father, struggled with the fading light to read a biblical\r\nstory. Someone helped with a lighted mosquito candle.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a certain point David did the traditional stamping on the wineglass, to\r\nmingled shouts of \"Good luck!\" and \"Mazeltov!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe speeches by friends and relations mentioned gay rights, shagging and\r\nhope for the future. And messages came from all over, including from the\r\nPalestinian Authority's representative in Australia, from John Pilger and\r\nfrom others in all continents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe freshly-married couple did the Wedding Waltz from \"The Jolson Story\".\r\nSome of David's relations looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an evening that could never be repeated. Meni said to me later that\r\nit was the most political wedding she had ever been to. I said that every\r\nwedding makes a political statement of some kind, even if the participants\r\nare unaware of it. But that was just me, being profound again. We both\r\nenjoyed ourselves immensely.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n\r\nMelbourne January 4 1998\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: DingoNet@compuserve.com at INTERNET TO: Moishe Miller Subject: It's a\r\nDOCTOR Date: 11/8/98 10:38 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n Asheley Jones and David Langsam (DnA)\r\n\r\n\r\nare ecstatic to announce the birth of their son\r\n\r\n\r\nDR ALEXANDER GEORGE LANGSAM\r\n\r\n\r\n(Dr Alecsander Shlomo ben David Arieh)\r\n\r\n\r\non November 9, 1998 (0055 Eastern Summer Time, 1355GMT8/11/98)\r\n\r\n\r\nat the Royal Women's Hospital Melbourne, Australia\r\n\r\n\r\nAlex is about 48-50 cms long and weighs about 3.2kg 7.5lb\r\n\r\n\r\nHe sends his best regards to all.\r\n\r\n\r\nMother Son and father are all very very very happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: DingoNet@compuserve.com\r\nSubject: Chanuka & etc. PostedDate: 12/28/98 Send To: =Moishe Miller\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n\r\n\r\ngood to hear from you again. No new Langsams other than the seven week old\r\nAlexander George sleeping (momentarily) in the next room. Isn't he enough,\r\nalready?\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is really a very wonderful and totally Langsam boy. Golden red hair, deep\r\ndark blue eyes, the Langsam schnoz and lungs and huge feet and hands, so\r\nlike the rest of us he can work with his hands and be creative with them at\r\nthe same time - an attribute of all my family. we love him to bits and will\r\nmake you some more Langsams as soon as we are able to get some sleep in the\r\nsame time zone.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Asheley & Alexander\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: DingoNet@compuserve.com\r\nSubject: Re: Chanuka & etc.\r\nDate: 12/29/98 03:20:15 PM\r\nSendTo: CN=Moishe Miller\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Dawkins gives a definite to that, it's just a matter of how far\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I met Alex Langsam in Manchester it was really unbelievable. Blue eyes\r\nreceding witches peak, full ear lobes, BIG lungs, deep booming voice, and\r\nvery much like my uncle Simon ... whose original name was Alexander!\r\n\r\n\r\nBut how do you find a connection with the information we have? Can a DNA\r\ntest do it - I understand they are horendously expensive. Can my namesake\r\nDavid Langsam who is the deputy boss of IREX give us a lot of money to\r\nresearch this intriguing academic problem?\r\n\r\n\r\nbest regards for the new goyisher year,\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: DingoNet@compuserve.com Date: 12/30/98  SendTo: Moishe Miller\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Langsam is care of International Research & Exchanges Board (IREX)\r\n1616 H Street, NW Washington, DC 20006 Telephone: (202) 628-8188 Fax: (202)\r\n628-8189 E-mail: irex@gwuvm.gwu.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nI think he is vice president or Director of Capital Development or somesuch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlex Langsam is much harder to contact. He owns hotels in Manchester and\r\nLiverpool and has had a number of people claim to be family in order to try\r\nto fleece him. It would not surprise me if his response is sceptical. Last I\r\nheard he had a very bad case of rheumatoid arthritis and that made his\r\nworking life very difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\nyou can try faxing Manchester 44.161.2367416 or writing to him at: Britannia\r\nHotels Former Fire Station London Road Picadilly Manchester U.K. M1 2PH\r\n\r\n\r\nbest of luck\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: DingoNet@compuserve.com Subject: Re: Chanuka & etc. PostedDate:\r\n12/30/98 03:46:03 PM SendTo: CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential\r\nDeliveredDate: 12/30/98 03:58:50 PM\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's the best I've got. I have never been in touch with him, only saw his\r\nname when I searched my own via AltaVista and noted that he was responsible\r\nfor handing out large sums of money for research and development of the\r\nformer Eastern Bloc (where we all come from!) and didn't try to contact\r\nhim - although a few hundred thousand dollars would not go astray. I WANTED\r\nto, but I held back. Decorum.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut they have phone numbers so a quick call from NY to DC could be\r\nproductive. I'd be pleased to be kept informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n Shana Tova shel Gregory.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDingoNet@compuserve.com Monday March 29, 1999 05:19 AM To: Moishe\r\nMiller/PSG/Prudential cc: Subject: Pesach & Langsams\r\n\r\n\r\nAhhh Moishe, you bloody geneologist!\r\n\r\n\r\nI knew that if I included you on my email list of good wishes it would never\r\nbe the end of it!!!\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the way, I now have a family and geneology page added to my site with\r\nlink to yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/dingonet\r\n\r\n\r\ngo to the bottom of the page and follow the links.\r\n\r\n\r\nbestest regards for Pesach,\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n\r\n Date: Thu, 24 May 2001 01:02:24 -0400\r\nTo: DingoNet@compuserve.com\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Birth Record of Akiva Langsam of Warsaw\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nStumbled across this at www.Jewishgen.org\r\n\r\nhttp://www.jewishgen.org/jri-pl/jriplweb.htm\r\n\r\nIt list birth of Akiva Langsam, son of Moshe and Sarah, born jun 12, \r\n1839.
