In life, quadratic growth can\ninstead be achieved by \"breeders\", puffer train convoys that lay out a\nlinear sequence of <a href=\"guns.html\">glider guns</a>.  In B35/S236,\nalso, breeders exist.  I used to not know of any <a\nhref=\"puffer.html\">puffer trains</a>, so instead I formed the following\nbreeder out of \"tethered rakes\": fixed gun emplacements which send out\nglider salvos towards a slower (c/3) <a\nhref=\"glider.html\">spaceship</a>, forming sideways gliders which meet to\nmake the sequence of guns. The only technical complication is that the\ngun sequence ends up between the tethers, so the gliders need to be\ntimed to pass through the tethers unharmed.</p>\n\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"breeder.lif\"><img src=\"breeder.gif\"\nwidth=\"424\" height=\"396\" alt=\"breeder\"></a></div>\n\n<p>(Note: this breeder was developed before I found the <a href= \n\"construct.html\">three-glider p68 synthesis</a>, or the <a href= \n\"glider.html\">7x7 c/3 spaceship</a>, and could likely be somewhat\nsimplified by using both of these newer ideas.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"/~eppstein/ca/b35s236/\">B35/S236</a> -- <a href= \n\"/~eppstein/ca/\">Cellular Automata</a> -- <a href=\"/~eppstein/\">D.\nEppstein</a> -- <a href=\"/\">UCI Inf. &amp; Comp.
