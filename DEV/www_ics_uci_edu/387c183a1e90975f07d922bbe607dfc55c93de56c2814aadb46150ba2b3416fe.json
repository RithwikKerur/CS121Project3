We'll look at the law governing the use and misuse of these words and symbols, along with the general guidelines concerning when it's proper, and improper, to use a trademark that belongs to someone else. Finally, we will cover the special kinds of trademark issues that have arisen, and are likely to arise, on the Net.<P>\r\nWhat is a trademark?<P>\r\nCoca-Cola. Velveeta. Microsoft Windows. Netscape. JiffyLube.<P>\r\nWe have seen that copyright law does not, generally speaking, cover individual words or short phrases. So, for example, the Kraft Corporation cannot protect, under *copyright* law, the word &quot;velveeta&quot;; it can't, that is, claim that you are infringing its copyright in the word &quot;velveeta&quot; if you use the word any way that you'd like - you can call your next novel (or your Web page) &quot;The Velveeta Connection,&quot; if you'd like, or put &quot;Better than Velveeta&quot; in you .sig file, or even call the cheese that you sell &quot;velveeta,&quot; and there's nothing that Kraft can do *under copyright law* to stop you.<P>\r\nBut that is not to say that there is *nothing* that Kraft Corporation can do to restrict your use of this word. Velveeta may well be a protectable trademark - in fact, it is a protectable trademark - and as a result Kraft *can* stop you from using that word in certain ways (but not *all* ways) under trademark law.<P>\r\nFirst, what is a trademark? Words, symbols and designs, sounds, distinctive colors - virtually anything that can be used to identify specific goods or services and distinguish them in the market from other similar goods or services - is *potentially* a trademark. But you can't eat potential, as one sage put it - to actually be protectable as a trademark the word or symbol or whatever must fulfill three basic criteria:<P>\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>It must be in actual *use* as an identifier of particular goods or services: you can't get a trademark in some great new name you've come up with for your new product until you actually start using that name to identify that product.<P>\r\n<LI>It has to be in some way distinctive, not what courts call &quot;ordinary&quot; or &quot;merely descriptive&quot; or &quot;generic&quot;: you can't use trademark to protect the common name of your product - say, the name &quot;Modems&quot; for the modems you are selling (because that is a generic term) nor the phrase &quot;Tasty donuts&quot; (which merely describes the donuts).<P>\r\n<LI>Finally, the mark must not be &quot;confusingly similar&quot; to anyone else's trademark that is already in use.<P>\r\n</OL>\r\nWhen are marks &quot;confusingly similar&quot;? When &quot;reasonable consumers&quot; would be confused as to the identity of the goods or services being labeled - when they would associate products or services together that in fact have no association.<P>\r\n The use of the word &quot;Ritz&quot; for a brand of crackers can be a trademark - even though there is also a hotel chain that uses the same name, because a reasonable consumer would not be confused into thinking that there was any association between these two very different kinds of goods. Similarly, Lexus is a protected trademark for a kind of automobile; even though it is similar to the pre-existing &quot;Lexis&quot; trademark used by the legal database supplier, it is not *confusingly* similar because the reasonable consumer would not think that a supplier of legal databases suddenly went into the car manufacturing business (or at least that's what a court has said). Lexus might, however, have had problems if they were labeling not automobiles but, say, magazines; the magazine market and the database market are a lot closer together, and it would be a lot easier to argue that consumers *would* associate the magazine with the database because a similar name was used.<P>\r\n\r\n<BR>authors:\r\n<TABLE CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>\r\n<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Larry Lessig</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>David Post</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Eugene Volokh</TD></TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<BR>\r\n<CENTER>\r\n<HR SIZE=\"3\" WIDTH=\"65%\">\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"../csl_lessons.html\">Back to Lesson Index</A>\r\n</CENTER>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\">\r\nCopyright \u00a9 1999 Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc.
