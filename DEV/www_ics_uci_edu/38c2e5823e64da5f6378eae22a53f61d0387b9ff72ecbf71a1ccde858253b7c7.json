It is a research project examining issues\nin two primary areas.   First, those issues necessary to create\nan evolvable software development environment based on abstract\ninterfaces to pro-active components, and second, issues associated\nwith techniques, tools, and processes for the formal definition,\nanalysis, evaluation, and automation of software processes and\nproducts.\n\n<P>\n\nThe project is organized into several areas of study: environment\narchitectures and interoperability mechanisms, user interfaces,\nhypermedia, process (modeling, programming, and execution), \nobject management, measurement and evaluation, language processing, \nconfiguration management, and analysis and testing.\nThe analysis area is further subdivided into concurrency\nanalysis, dependence and flow analysis, and analysis tool\ninfrastructure.\n\n<P>\n\nPrototypes are used to validate approaches taken in the individual\nareas as well as to investigate technical interactions between areas.\n\n<P>\n\nThe Arcadia consortium is comprised of researchers from the\nUniversity of California, Irvine (UCI), the University of Massachusetts\nat Amherst (UMass), the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU), and\nPurdue University.\n\n<P>\n\nSee the <A HREF=\"philosophy.html\">Arcadia philosophy</A> for\n<EM>effective</EM> software engineering environments.\n\n<P>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Wed Feb 17 14:23:37 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
