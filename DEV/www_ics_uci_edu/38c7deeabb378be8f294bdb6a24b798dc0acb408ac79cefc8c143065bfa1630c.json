The idea is genius: allow a fraction of the items\ninserted into the priority queue to have their keys artificially\nincreased (corrupted), and in exchange, we get fast operations. We\ndescribe a new, simpler implementation of the Soft Heap, and discuss\nthe clever ways that Soft Heaps have been used in the literature.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
