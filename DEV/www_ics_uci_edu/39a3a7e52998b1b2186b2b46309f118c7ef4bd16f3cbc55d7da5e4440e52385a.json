Several existing web graph models \ngenerate power law graphs by adding new vertices and non-uniform \nedge connectivities to existing graphs. Researchers have \nconjectured that preferential connectivity and incremental growth \nare both required for the power law distribution. In this paper, \nwe propose a different web graph model with power law distribution \nthat does not require incremental growth. We also provide a \ncomparison of our model with several others in their ability to \npredict web graph clustering behavior.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
