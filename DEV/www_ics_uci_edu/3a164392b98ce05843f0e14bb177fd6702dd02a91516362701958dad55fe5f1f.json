An undergraduate class in\nalgorithms is also good background. The course, however, is fairly self-contained\nand should be accessible to\nany student who is comfortable with mathematical abstraction and proofs.\n\n<h3> Course Requirements </h3>\nThere will be a total of five problem sets, due on Monday of week 3, 5, 7, 9 and the first day\nof finals period.\n<p>\n<b> Homework Policies: </b>\nThe homework exercised are an essential part of this course\nbecause the practice solving problems is important part of\nunderstanding the material. You can probably find many of the\nsolutions to the homework exercises on the internet or in the\nliterature but you will not get the benefit of solving the problems\non your own. Therefore, the only sources you are allowed to consult\nin solving  these problems are the recommended texts and notes from class\n(either mine, yours or those of another student).\n<p>\nI encourage you to work in small groups, but you must note your\ncollaborators on the homework you turn in. In addition, you must\nwrite up your own solutions without any collaboration.\n<p>\nYou are also encouraged to put your solutions into LaTeX.\nHere is a template that you can use:\n<a href=\"hw_template.tex\">\nHomework Template\n</a>.\n<h3>  Course Materials </h3>\nI will provide my own course notes before every lecture (although not necessarily very much in advance).\nWhen they are posted, you can reach them by clicking on the topic name in the course outline below.\nThis is theoretically all you should need for understanding the material in class. However, you may\nwish to consult my sources in preparing these notes.
