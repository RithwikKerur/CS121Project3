There is some proof using hyperbolic geometry I heard, but\n&gt; can't recall,  that embeds the rings at infinity in H^3 and then using some\n&gt; group generated by reflections get a contradiction. Are there other proofs?\n&gt; It can be done with squares though.\nOr with three ellipses, all with arbitrarily small eccentricity.\n\n3 round circles in R^3 (or its conformal compactification S^3) with pairwise\nlinking number 0  bound  3 mutually disjoint hemispheres in the 4 ball\nH^4 union S^3.\nEach hemisphere is the compactification of a hyperbolic plane.\nConsider a round 4 ball with radius R(t) increasing linearly with time and with center not lying on one of the three hyperbolic planes. Let T be the last of the times when it touches one (say N) of the three planes L. M, N. Then there is a hyperplane Q tangent to the ball B(T) at the point of tangency with  the plane \nN. There's an isotopy, within the class of totally geodesic planes which \nare disjoint from L and M,\nof  the plane N within the hyperplane Q which ends at a plane P' which is is separated from L and M  by a hyperplane disjoint \nfrom L, M and P'. Therefore a link of 3 round circles which have linking \nnumbers zero is split. (In fact by a further isotopy one can see that the link is the trivial link.) So the Borromean rings is not a link of round circles.\n\nI heard this at MSRI in 1983. I think the argument is Freedman's. I don't \nthink reflection groups have anything to do with it, though there may be a\nvariant argument.\n\n--\nGeoffrey Mess\nDepartment of Mathematics, UCLA. <A HREF=\"mailto:geoff@math.ucla.edu\">geoff@math.ucla.edu</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:asimov@nas.nasa.gov\">asimov@nas.nasa.gov</A> (Daniel A.
