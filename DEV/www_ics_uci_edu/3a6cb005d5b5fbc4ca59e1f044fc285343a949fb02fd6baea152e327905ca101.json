TIFF Overview</h3>\n      \n      \n      <p>\n            TIFF provides a means for describing, storing and interchanging\n            raster image data. A primary goal of TIFF is to provide a rich\n            environment within which applications can exchange image data. The\n            current TIFF specification [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>] defines a commonly used, core set\n            of TIFF fields known as Baseline TIFF. The current specification and\n            TIFF Technical Notes 1 and 2 [<a title=\"Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf\" href=\"chapter11.html#TTN1\">TTN1</a>, <a title=\"Draft TIFF Technical Note 2, Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification, March 17, 1995, ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TTN2.draft.txt\" href=\"chapter11.html#TTN2\">TTN2</a>] define several TIFF\n            extensions. The TIFF- based specification for fax applications uses a\n            subset of Baseline TIFF fields, with selected extensions, as\n            described in this document. In a few cases, this document defines new\n            TIFF fields specifically for fax applications.\n         \n      </p>\n      <a name=\"sub1sub1\"></a><h3>2.1.1. File Structure</h3>\n      \n      \n      <p>\n            TIFF is designed for raster images, which makes it a good match for\n            facsimile documents, which are multi-page raster images. Each raster\n            image consists of a number of rows or scanlines, each of which has\n            the same number of pixels, the unit of sampling. Each pixel has at\n            least one sample or component (exactly one for black-and-white\n            images).\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            A TIFF file begins with an 8-byte image file header. The first two\n            bytes describe the byte order used within the file. Legal values are\n            \"II\" (0x4949) when bytes are ordered from least to most significant\n            (little- endian), and \"MM\" (0x4D4D), when bytes are ordered from most\n            to least significant (big-endian) within a 16- or 32-bit integer.\n            Either byte order can be used, except in the case of the minimal\n            black-and-white mode, which SHALL use value \"II\". The next two bytes\n            contain the value 42 that identifies the file as a TIFF file and is\n            ordered according to the value in the first two bytes of the header.\n            The last four bytes give the offset that points to the first image\n            file directory (IFD). This and all other offsets in a TIFF file are\n            with respect to the beginning of the TIFF file. An IFD can be at any\n            location in the file after the header but must begin on a word\n            boundary.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            An IFD is a sequence of tagged fields, sorted in ascending order by\n            tag value. An IFD consists of a 2-byte count of the number of fields,\n            a sequence of field entries and a 4-byte offset to the next IFD. The\n            fields contain information about the image and pointers to the image\n            data. Each separate raster image in the file is represented by an\n            IFD.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            Each field entry in an IFD has 12 bytes and consists of a 2-byte Tag,\n            2 bytes identifying the field type (e.g. short, long, rational,\n            ASCII), 4 bytes giving the count (number of values or offsets), and 4\n            bytes that either contain the offset to a field value stored outside\n            the IFD, or, based on the type and count, the field value itself.\n            Resolution and metadata such as dates, names and descriptions are\n            examples of \"long\" field values that do not fit in 4 bytes and\n            therefore use offsets in the field entry. Details are given in the\n            TIFF specification [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>].\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            A TIFF file can contain more than one IFD, where each IFD is a\n            subfile whose type is given in the NewSubfileType field. Multiple\n            IFDs can be organized either as a linked list, with the last entry in\n            each IFD pointing to the next IFD (the pointer in the last IFD is 0),\n            or as a tree, using the SubIFDs field in the primary IFD [<a title=\"Adobe PageMaker 6.0 TIFF Technical Notes, Sept. 14, 1995, http://www.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/PDFS/TN/TIFFPM6.pdf\" href=\"chapter11.html#TTN1\">TTN1</a>]. The\n            SubIFDs field contains an array of pointers to child IFDs of the\n            primary IFD.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            Child IFDs describe related images, such as reduced resolution\n            versions of the primary IFD image. The same IFD can point both to a\n            next IFD and to child IFDs, and child IFDs can themselves point to\n            other IFDs.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            All fax modes represent a multi-page fax image as a linked list of\n            IFDs, with a NewSubfileType field containing a bit that identifies\n            the IFD as one page of a multi-page document. Each IFD has a\n            PageNumber field, identifying the page number in ascending order,\n            starting at 0 for the first page. While a Baseline TIFF reader is not\n            required to read any IFDs beyond the first, an implementation that\n            reads the files that comply with this specification SHALL read\n            multiple IFDs. Only the Mixed Raster Content fax mode, described in\n            Section 8, requires the use of child IFDs.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            The following figure illustrates the structure of a multi-page TIFF\n            file.\n         \n      </p>\n      <pre>\n                   +-----------------------+\n                   |         Header        |------------+\n                   +-----------------------+            | First IFD\n                   |      IFD (page 0)     |&lt;-----------+ Offset\n               +---|                       |------------+\n         Value |   +-----------------------+            |\n        Offset +--&gt;|      Long Values      |--+         |\n                   +-----------------------|  | Strip   |\n                   |       Image Data      |&lt;-+ Offset  |\n                   |     strip 1 page 0    |  |         |\n                   +-----------------------+  |         |\n                   |           :           |  :         |\n                                                        |\n                   +-----------------------+            | Next IFD\n                   |      IFD (page 1)     |&lt;-----------+ Offset\n               +---|                       |------------+\n         Value |   +-----------------------+            |\n        Offset +--&gt;|      Long Values      |--+         |\n                   +-----------------------|  | Strip   |\n                   |       Image Data      |&lt;-+ Offset  |\n                   |     strip 1 page 1    |  |         |\n                   +-----------------------+  |         |\n                   |     strip 2 page 1    |&lt;-+         |\n                   +-----------------------+  |         |\n                   |          :            |  :         |\n                                                        |\n                   +-----------------------+            | Next IFD\n                   |      IFD (page 2)     |&lt;-----------+ Offset\n                   |          :            |\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub1sub2\"></a><h3>2.1.2. Image Structure</h3>\n      \n      \n      <p>\n            An IFD stores an image as one or more strips, as shown in the\n            preceding figure. A strip consists of 1 or more scanlines (rows) of\n            raster image data in compressed form. An image may be stored in a\n            single strip or may be divided into several strips, which would\n            require less memory to buffer. (Baseline TIFF recommends about 8k\n            bytes per strip, but existing fax usage is typically one strip per\n            image.)\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            Each IFD requires three strip-related fields: StripOffsets,\n            RowsPerStrip and StripByteCounts. The StripOffsets field is an array\n            of pointers to the strip or strips that contain the actual image\n            data. The StripByteCounts field gives the number of bytes in each\n            strip after compression. TIFF requires that each strip, except the\n            last, contain the same number of scanlines, which is given in the\n            RowsPerStrip field. This document introduces the new StripRowCounts\n            field that allows a variable number of scanlines per strip, which is\n            required by the Mixed Raster Content fax mode (Section 8).\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            Image data is stored as uninterpreted, compressed image data streams\n            within a strip. The formats of these streams follow the ITU-T\n            Recommendations. The Compression field in the IFD indicates the type\n            of compression, and other TIFF fields in the IFD describe image\n            attributes, such as color encoding and spatial resolution.\n            Compression parameters are stored in the compressed data stream,\n            rather than in TIFF fields. This makes the TIFF representation and\n            compressed data format specification independent of each another.\n            This approach, modeled on [<a title=\"Draft TIFF Technical Note 2, Replacement TIFF/JPEG specification, March 17, 1995, ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TTN2.draft.txt\" href=\"chapter11.html#TTN2\">TTN2</a>], allows TIFF to gracefully add new\n            compression schemes as they become available.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            Some attributes can be specified both in the compressed data stream\n            and within a TIFF field. It is possible that the two values will\n            differ. When this happens for values required to interpret the data\n            stream, then the values in the data stream take precedence. For\n            informational values that are not required to interpret the data\n            stream, such as author name, then the TIFF field value takes\n            precedence.\n         \n      </p>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub1sub3\"></a><h3>2.1.3. TIFF File Structure for Fax Applications</h3>\n      \n      \n      <p>\n            The TIFF specification has a very flexible file structure, which does\n            not specify the ordering of IFDs, field values and image data in a\n            file. Individual applications may require or recommend an ordering.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            This specification recommends that when using a TIFF file for\n            facsimile, A multi-page fax document SHOULD be represented as a\n            linked list of IFDs. It also recommends that a TIFF file for\n            facsimile SHOULD order pages in a TIFF file in the same way that they\n            are ordered in a fax data stream. In a TIFF file, a page consists of\n            several elements: one or more IFDs (including subIFDs), long field\n            values that are stored outside the IFDs, and image data (in one or\n            more strips).\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            The minimal black-and-white mode (Profile S) specifies a required\n            ordering of pages and elements within a page (Section 3.5). The\n            extended black-and-white mode (Profile F) provides guidelines for\n            ordering pages and page elements (Section 4.4.6). Other profiles\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            SHOULD follow these guidelines. This recommendation is intended to\n            simplify the implementation of TIFF writers and readers in fax\n            applications and the conversion between TIFF file and fax data stream\n            representations. However, for interchange robustness, readers SHOULD\n            be prepared to read TIFF files whose structure is consistent with\n            [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>], which supports a more flexible file structure than is\n            recommended here.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            This specification introduces an optional new GlobalParametersIFD\n            field, defined in Section 2.2.4.

While it is often\n            possible to obtain these parameters by scanning the file, it is\n            convenient to make them available together in one place for fast and\n            easy access.
