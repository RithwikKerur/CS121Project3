So after deciding not to pursue\na future in Engineering, I figured the Buisness market was the way I \nwanted to go.  Now the question was <I>how?</I>.</P>\n<P>I decided the easiest way was to Major in Economics, \nMinor in Management and try to get a MBA after I graduated.  \nThe <A HREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu\"> Social Sciences \nDept.</A> at UCI was very helpful, but I still needed some \ninofrmation on how to get my MBA.  While searching the Web I \nfound a wonderful home page through the Univ. of Texas.  The \n<A HREF=\"http://mundo.eco.utexas.edu/Economics/Handbook/l-grad.sch.html\"> Graduate School</A>    \nhome page allowed me to find some helpful information.  Such \nas the basic five factors that will help me enter good \nGraduate school.</P>\nThe five factors are:\n<OL>\n<B><LI>GPA</LI><LI>Test scores on the LSAT, GMAT, or GRE</LI> \n<LI>Recommendation letters</LI><LI>Extracurricular activities</LI>\n<LI>Work experience</LI></B></OL>\n\n<P>Out of these five factors I have found out that Work \nExperience tends to be one of the most important factors \nwhich Grad schools look at.  I was also able to find other important \nhelpful, information through the home page.  Like me if you just click on \nGraduate School you can find out more information.</P> \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<P><LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>What upper division classes are required for an \nEconomics major?</B></A><br></P>\n<P>Before I can get my MBA, I have to make sure I graduate from UCI with \nall the required requirements completed.  In order to gradute with an \nEconmics major, besides the breath requirements one must complete all \nlower division and upper division Economic courses with passing grades.</P>\n<P>The easiest way to find information on courses without speaking to the \nstaff.  Would be to look at the <A \nHREF=\"gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/new.cat/ss/econ\">Dept. of \nEcon. Course Catalog.</A>  I was able to find out that along with Econ \n100A-B-C it is required that one must complete four additional \nupper-division courses of their choice.  The four courses can be chosen \nfrom different catagories ranging from Quantitative Methods to Financial \nEconomics.</P>\n<P>The only problem now is when should I take them and when are they \noffered?  This question is not to hard to answer, because all that I have \nto do is look at the appopriate <A \nHREF=\"gopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/11/ro/soc\">Scedule of Classes</A> catalog.\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<P><LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>How can multimedia enhance computers?\n</B></A><br></P>\n<P>Multimedia is the use of graphics, sound, animation and video with the \nuse of computers.  The addition of multimedia to computers helps people \nsearch the web with a whole new experience.  The idea of multimedia not \nonly enhances a users experience, but opens up new paths to view.</P>\n<P>The new paths which appear, allow someone to access such things as: <A \nHREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Computers/Multimedia/Pictures/\"> \nvarious graphical pictures</A>, <A \nHREF=\"http://tns-www.lcs.mit.edu/vs/demos.html\">video files</A>, <A \nHREF=\"http://tns-www.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/sports/nba/highlights\"> and even \nNBA sports highlights.</A>  The use of multimedia allows a broader use of \ncomputers from schools as a learning experience to businesses as a tool \nto compete in a competitive market.  So no matter who you are multimedia \nwill help to enhance your experience with computers.</P> \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></A></P>\n\n<P><LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>How important is the WWW for me?</B></A><br></P>\n<P>The WWW plays an important role in the life of many people, including \nme. Without the web today it would be very difficult for people to find \ncertain information.
