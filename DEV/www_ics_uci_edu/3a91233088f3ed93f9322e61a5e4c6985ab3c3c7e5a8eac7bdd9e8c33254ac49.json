I'll\n    also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't skip it  without getting in touch).

We can't support make-ups for missed quizzes, since you just have to read and submit them each week on EEE. This is easy credit to get; just don't forget to do the quiz each Monday. (The foolish student would take the opportunity to answer &quot;Zot! Zot! Zot!&quot; to every question, giving them no thought.  The wise student will take the time to work through the quizzes independently, recognizing that these are previews of exam questions and  an excellent way to prepare, review, and assess one's mastery of the material when the chips are down.)<BR />\n  </FONT><I>\u2022 Two midterms: </I>Given in lecture, the first will be on Tuesday, January 29 and the second on Thursday, February 21 (20%, with the second being weighted more than the first).

Thus, comparison of scores between TAs is meaningless.</P>\n<P><FONT >Lab scores will be recorded on the web in the EEE gradebook. We will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we\n  must ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the\n  item is returned; the course moves quickly and we simply can&#39;t deal\n  with assignments long past.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT >We find that we obtain the fairest grade outcomes overall by not committing in advance to a specific fixed point scale for assigning final letter grades in the course. Thus, it is not possible to calculate your letter grade precisely until all the work has been done. We urge everyone to focus not on letter grades but on learning what's necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</FONT> You should check the EEE gradebook periodically to make sure your assignment scores have been recorded correctly. EEE also indicates where your score falls compared to other students; if you find yourself in the bottom quarter consistently, talk with your TA or the instructor.</P>\n<P>We're required to say that in unusual circumstances, these policies may change, but we do not expect that to happen.</P>\n<P>\n<FONT ><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations.

It&#39;s not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat\n  lecture material you missed, though of course the TA will always answer questions about\n  it.</FONT> And even though UCI Replay recordings will be available for most class sessions, they don't capture everything that goes on in class and they aren't 100% reliable (i.e., some days there will be no recording).</P>\n<P> <FONT >Attend your lab section, too;\n  you will do most of your lab work there, and you can get a different perspective from the TA than you hear in lecture.\n  Don&#39;t hesitate to ask your TA to address topics  that will help you. \n  Since most of your work will be done with a partner, your partner also depends\n  on your consistent presence.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Check your electronic mail regularly; this\n  is an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Keep up with the reading; you&#39;ll need it\n  to do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed\n  pages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#39;re not careful.  You\n  will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about parts\n  that aren&#39;t clear. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >The assignments, like all technical specifications,\n  require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back\n  to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about\n  what&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure\n  to read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Start each assignment early.  Assignments will\n  be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly every\n  day.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will,\n  even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll\n  have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >If you find yourself having trouble or getting\n  behind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  We have lots of ways to help.\n  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and\n  turning it in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on\n  a lab assignment or exam. ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more\n  complete discussion, see our course collaboration guidelines (<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html</code></a>) and the ICS departmental web page covering academic\nhonesty issues (</FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty</code></A><FONT >).</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Turn in whatever portion of an assignment you\n  have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something\n  rather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances\n  you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after the\n  due date, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date\n  comes.  Likewise, don&#39;t skip any quizzes if you can help it; too many zeroes will significantly lower your overall score.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Always keep your own copy of each assignment,\n  both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\n  shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),\n  we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT ><B>Approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n</p><TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0>\n  <COL WIDTH=8% />\n  <COL WIDTH=15% />\n  <COL WIDTH=77% />\n  <TR>\n    <TD WIDTH=8% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Week</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Date</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=77% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Topics (and chapters in the Perkovic text)</U></FONT></TD>\n  </TR>\n  <!--\n  <TR>\n    <TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
