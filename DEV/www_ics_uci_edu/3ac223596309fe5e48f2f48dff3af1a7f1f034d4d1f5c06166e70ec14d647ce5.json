Clarke, Andy Podgurski, Debra J. Richardson, and Steven J. Zeil in\n<i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i>,\nSE-15(11), November 1989.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nA number of path selection criteria have been proposed throughout the \nyears. Unfortunately, little work has been done on comparing these \ncriteria. To determine what would be an effective path selection \ncriterion for revealing faults in programs, we have undertaken an \nevaluation of these criteria. This paper reports on the results of \nour evaluation of path selection criteria based on data flow relationships. \nWe show how these criteria relate to each other, thereby demonstrating some\nof their strengths and weaknesses. In addition, we suggest minor changes \nto some criteria that improve their performance. We conclude with a \ndiscussion of the major limitations of these criteria and directions \nfor future research. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:39:25 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
