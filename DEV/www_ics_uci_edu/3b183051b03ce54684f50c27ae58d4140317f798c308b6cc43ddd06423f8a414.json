It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with UCI's current academic honesty policies. Please take the time to read the current UCI Senate Academic Honesty Policies and the Bren School Policies on Academic Honesty.\r\n\r\nThe policies in these documents will be adhered to scrupulously. Any student who engages in cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, or collusion in dishonest activities, will receive an academic evaluation of ``F'' for the entire course, with a letter of explanation to the student's permanent file. The ICS Student Affairs Office will be involved at every step of the process. Dr. Lathrop seeks to create a level playing field for all students. \r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
