The answer is no; SubprogramDeclaration is an AST node, so it's my assumption that each of you already has a similar class (or classes) yourself, so providing mine would be of little benefit (and probably cause more problems than it would solve).</p></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>M 2/23</td>\r\n    <td><a href=\"LabManual/Assignment4\">Assignment #4</a> is available.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>M 2/23</td>\r\n    <td>A minor typo was found on the <a href=\"MidtermAnswers.html\">Midterm answer sheet</a>.

This is motivated by two goals.  Firstly, I want everyone to have a chance to get this assignment finished, because it's a very satisfying one to complete -- it feels like you've finished a significant portion of a \"real\" compiler.  Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, at least Part 1 of your solution to Assignment #3 will need to be reused in Assignment #4.</li>\r\n        <li>I've made a couple of updates to the assignment.  The write-up has been updated to reflect them, but to keep things simple for those of you who have already started, here is a <a href=\"Assignment3Update.zip\">Zip archive</a> containing only the updates.  Be sure you read the README.txt file first; it explains what the changes are.  (In short, if you aren't very far into Part 2 yet, they won't affect what you've already done.  If you are deeply into Part 2, it's likely that they will only affect one or two lines of your code.)</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Th 2/12</td>\r\n    <td>The <a href=\"Schedule.html\">Schedule</a> has been updated with the reading that corresponds to the lecture material from yesterday.

Since this is an early beta, the language features are new for everyone (including the course staff), and tool support for the new language features is still very much up in the air, the clear decision here is to disallow the use of the new Java 1.5 language features for the remainder of this course.  As much as I'd like to allow you to use the latest and greatest, be warned: if the code you submit cannot be compiled and run using Java 1.4, you won't get credit for your assignment.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>T 2/3</td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <p>The assignment grades will be posted to the EEE GradeBook when finished, which you can access via <a href=\"http://eee.uci.edu/\">EEE</a>.  Included for each assignment will be your score and an explanation of what you were marked down for.  There are a couple of things that you need to know, however.  (Please note that the scores aren't there yet, but will be soon.)</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>There are three graders who are working on assignments this quarter.  Essentially, the class has been split (alphabetically) into three sections, with each grader handling all of the assignments for one of the sections.  The consequence here, of course, is that different graders may grade differently.  A statistical adjustment will be made at the end of the quarter, which will seek the equalize the percentage of points lost by each section.  That means that comparing your score to a score from a student in another section is not necessarily meaningful.  If you're in the \"hard\" section where the scores are lower, the scores will be boosted somewhat at the end of the quarter to compensate.</li>\r\n        <li>If you're interested in having your assignment regraded, you should first contact the grader.  If you're unable to resolve the issue with the grader, then you should contact the TA, Carmen Badea (<a href=\"mailto:carmen@ics.uci.edu\">carmen@ics.uci.edu</a>).  If you're still unable to resolve the issue, <i>then</i> you should contact me.  In short, the TA and graders are entirely responsible for this quarter's grading.  They know the intimate details of how it was done; I don't.  So I prefer only to arbitrate in a case when you think you've really been treated unfairly and can't find a resolution to the matter by communicating with the graders and/or TA.</li>\r\n        <li>To maintain some sanity in this very large class, the statute of limitations on regrade requests is seven days after the time when they were posted.  So, supposing that the grades for <a href=\"LabManual/Assignment1\">Assignment #1</a> were posted tomorrow (W 2/4), any regrade requests would have to be submitted by email no later than W 2/11.</li>\r\n        <li>Here are the names and email addresses of the graders:\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>If your last name begins with A-H, your assignments will be graded by Bo Xing (<a href=\"mailto:bxing@uci.edu\">bxing@uci.edu</a>).</li>\r\n            <li>If your last name begins with I-O, your assignments will be graded by Paolo D'Alberto (<a href=\"mailto:paolo@ics.uci.edu\">paolo@ics.uci.edu</a>).</li>\r\n            <li>If your last name begins with P-Z, your assignments will be graded by Jie Ren (<a href=\"mailto:jie@ics.uci.edu\">jie@ics.uci.edu</a>).</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>Sa 1/31</td>\r\n    <td>The <a href=\"Schedule.html\">Schedule</a> has been updated.</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td>F 1/30</td>\r\n    <td>I found a bug in the Monkie2004 grammar given in <a href=\"LabManual/Assignment2\">Assignment #2</a>.
