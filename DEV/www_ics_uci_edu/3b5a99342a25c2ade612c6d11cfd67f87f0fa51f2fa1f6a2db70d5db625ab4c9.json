So the problem is this:\nGiven a finite collection of lines in the plane, show that there is an\nintersection point at which exactly two meet.  Now remove a line at\ninfinity which is not in the collection, and return to the affine plane.\nConsider the triangle ABC of smallest area bounded by three of these lines.  \nIf there is a tie, we fix an origin and choose a minimal triangle whose centroid\nis as far as possible from that origin.\n\nSince at least 3 lines meet at each point A, B, C, we can find\nlines L, M, and N passing through A, B, and C respectively, and not equal\nto AB, BC, or CA.  If L and M meet at X, M and N at Y, and N and L at Z,\ntriangles XBC, AYC, and ABZ have area greater than or equal to that of\nABC.  But it is easy to show that if you divided a triangle XYZ into\n4 parts by choosing a point on each side and connecting, the area of the\ncenter triangle is greater than or equal to the largest of the corner triangles,\nwith equality if and only if all three points are midpoints.\nTherefore, XBC, AYC, ABZ, and ABC are all congruent, and one of the three outer\ntriangles has a midpoint further from the origin than ABC.

It is\nnot Erdos' proof, but I forget who he attributed it to.  In fact, Erdos\nadmitted that he had thought about the problem for a while but failed to\nsee a solution.\n\nFirst of all, a technicality: there is an obvious counterexample, namely\nof three or more points all in a straight line.  However, if we require\nthat not all the points of S are in a straight line, then the statement\nis true.\n\nSuppose S is finite.  Let L be the set of all lines that contain at\nleast two points of S.  For any line l and any point p, let d(l,p) be\nthe distance between l and p.  Let D be the set of all distances d(l,p)\nas l ranges over all of L and p ranges over all points in S not on l.\nSince not all the points in S are on a line, D is nonempty.  Since S is\nfinite, D is finite, and thus D has a least element d&gt;0.  Take a line\nl_0 in L and a point p_0 in S for which this distance is attained.\nDrop a perpendicular from p_0 to l_0, meeting at X.  We have this\npicture:\n\n                        p_0 .\n                            |\n                            | d\n     _______________________|_______________________  l_0\n                            X\n\nNow, since l_0 contains at least three distinct points of S by\nhypothesis, either there are two or more points in S to the left of X\nor there are two or more points in S to the right of X.  Suppose\nwithout loss of generality that the former holds, and let p_1 and p_2\nbe two points in S on l_0, with p_2 closer to X.  Inspection of similar\ntriangles shows that the distance between p_2 and the line in L\ndetermined by p_0 and p_1 is less than d, contradicting the minimality\nof d.\n--\nTim Chow    <A HREF=\"mailto:tycchow@phoenix.princeton.edu\">tycchow@phoenix.princeton.edu</A>\nNowadays the only unforgivable sins are racism, sexism, homophobia, and bigotry.\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:elkies@brauer.harvard.edu\">elkies@brauer.harvard.edu</A> (Noam Elkies)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Sylvester [was Re: summary...]\n<B>Date:</B>           21 Nov 90 20:05:00 GMT\n<B>Reply-To:</B>       <A HREF=\"mailto:elkies@zariski.harvard.edu\">elkies@zariski.harvard.edu</A> (Noam Elkies)\n<B>Organization:</B>   Harvard Math Department\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn article &lt;4171@idunno.Princeton.EDU&gt; <A HREF=\"mailto:larsen@mace.princeton.edu\">larsen@mace.princeton.edu</A> (Michael Larsen) writes:\n&gt;In article &lt;9226@mirsa.inria.fr&gt; <A HREF=\"mailto:abbott@mirsa.inria.fr\">abbott@mirsa.inria.fr</A> writes:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Find an easy(?) proof [or counter-example]:\n&gt;&gt;let S be a set of [noncollinear] points in the Euclidean plane such that\n&gt;&gt;for all x in S and for all y in S-{x} there is z in S-{x,y} collinear with x&amp;y.\n&gt;&gt;==&gt; S is an infinite set.\n&gt;\n&gt;This is a semi-classical problem.  I think it goes under the name of\n&gt;Sylvester's theorem.  My favorite proof was discovered by\n&gt;Noam Elkies, a sometime contributor to this newsgroup, when he was 13. [...]\n\nI'm afraid I cannot claim credit to this; the proof is contained in\none of Martin Gardner's \"Mathematical Games\" columns in _Scientific American_,\nwherein he introduces projective geometry and duality.  I had certainly read\nmost of these columns in back copies of _Sci. Am._ by the time I was assigned\nSylvester's problem (not properly \"Sylvester's Theorem\" since Sylvester\ndidn't prove it), so my solution was at best a subconscious reconstruction\nof that proof.\n\nHowever, I *can* claim credit to an analogous solution to the corresponding\nquestion over the complex numbers, asked by Serre in 1966 (Problem 5359\nin Vol.73 (1966) of the _Amer. Math. Monthly_):  Let S be a finite subset\nof *complex* projective 3-dimensional space, such that the line through\nany two points of S contains at least a third point of S; show that\nall the points of S are coplanar.  (We can no longer conclude collinearity\nbecause there are counterexamples in the complex plane, of which the\nsimplest is the set of nine inflection points of a nondegenerate cubic.)\n\nThis was first proved in 1986 by L.M. Kelly (\"A resolution of the Sylvester-\nGallai problem of J.-P. Serre\", Discrete Comput. Geom. 1 (1986), 101--104),\nusing an inequality of Hirzebruch on arrangements of lines (or, dually, of\npoints) in the complex projective plane.  But Hirzebruch's inequality\nrequires Miyaoka's inequality on the characteristic classes of a complex\nprojective 2-fold of general type (specifically the surface obtained\nby taking the square roots of the linear forms on CP^2 defining the lines\nof the arrangement) --- which seems an outrageously sophisticated tool \nto apply to such a problem.\n\nAnd indeed it turns out that essentially the same idea which gave \"my\"\nproof in P^2(R) also does it in P^3(C): construct the dual configuration,\nthrow away a generic plane to get a configuration of planes in the affine\nplane C^3, and, assuming that these planes are not coincident, consider\nthose four non-coincident planes forming a \"tetrahedron\" of minimal \"volume\"\n(the \"volume\" is defined as the absolute value of the determinant formed\nfrom the coordinates of the four points of triple intersection of the planes).\nAgain a contradiction is obtained from tetrahedra formed by other planes\nwhich must go through the lines of intersection of those four planes.\nTo be sure, the proof is not as immediate as in the real case, but it\nis entirely elementary.\n\nNote that the generalization to projective space over an arbitrary field K\nwon't give rise to any new theorems of this kind:  if K is of characteristic \nzero, any finite arrangement of points and lines over K can be embedded\nin complex projective space of the same dimension; and if K is of\npositive characteristic, it contains a finite field k, and then\nthe points of projective space of arbitrary dimension over k\ngive an obvious counterexmaple.\n\n--Noam D.
