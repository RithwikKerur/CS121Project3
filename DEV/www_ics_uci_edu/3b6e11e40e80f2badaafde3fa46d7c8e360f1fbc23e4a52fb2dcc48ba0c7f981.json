I gave \r\nher my information of which there is very little because of the fact that my \r\nfather-in-law was the only survivor of his family during the Holocaust.  He \r\nlived in a small village in Poland and he has been deceased for 21 years.  \r\nWhat little information we do have we have gotten from my mother-in-law and \r\nthat is pretty sketchy.  She knew that there were 2 uncles living in New \r\nYork.  By the time they emigrated to the U.S. they were elderly.  Their \r\nchildren wanted nothing to do with these foreign cousins so all contact broke \r\noff.  This family tree that was put together in the eighties could find no \r\nconnection with our branch of the Langsams.\r\n           I'm really sorry that I could not be of more help.\r\n                                                             Sincerely,\r\n                                                Marsha Langsam \r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: SaulL123@aol.com \r\nDate: Fri, 14 Jan 2000 09:32:54 EST \r\nSubject: Re: Langsam Family \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n           I located the book that was compiled by Michael Cohen.  Here is \r\nthe information I have:\r\n           My father-in-law's father, Louser had a brother (possibly more \r\nthan one) that came to the states (New York) in the early part of the 1900's. \r\n From the ship records that Michael Cohen discovered, there were 4 brothers \r\nthat came from Jurezkowa Poland.  They could very well be my father-in-law's \r\nuncles.  Their names were Abraham, Hersh, Meyer, and Shajie.  Their parents \r\nwere listed as Jacob Langsam and Leie Kabalnick.  Supposedly, Leie Kabalnick \r\nhad a brother Elias in New York. Abraham came first and went to an uncle M. \r\nGoldblatt in NYC.  He worked as a waiter at the Hotel Cecil in 1910 and lived \r\nat 30 w. 118th Street.\r\n              Louser stayed in Poland because his parents were there and \r\nraised his children, my father-in-law being the oldest, did not leave at the \r\nonset of the war as he had to take care of the farm.\r\n               My father-in-law had 3 brothers and 1 sister. Israel, Moishe, \r\nAaron and Rachel.\r\n                This is as far back as I can go since I was really lucky just \r\nto find out the names of my father-in-law's siblings.  No one bothered to ask \r\ntheir names for future baby namings.  I asked quite by accident while \r\nvisiting him in the hospital shortly before he passed away.\r\n                   We never pursued the contact of the relatives in New York \r\nand no one ever contacted us.\r\n                I hope this can help in some way.  If you find any relatives \r\nit would be nice because my husband has no one from his father's family.\r\n                                              Sincerely,\r\n                                        Marsha \r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nFrom: SaulL123@aol.com \r\nDate: Fri, 14 Jan 2000 16:19:36 EST \r\nSubject: RE: langsam family \r\nTo: Moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n           As I was perusing your website, I came across the log of social \r\nsecurity numbers with births and deaths.  One stood out.  I mentioned to you \r\nthat my father-in-law went to visit an Uncle Harry who lived in NY.  From the \r\nLangsam-Spira book (of which I have a copy)  The four brothers that came from \r\nmy father-in-laws home town  were probably his uncles.  The only one with a \r\nsocial security number is Harry.  His birth date matches.  The other three \r\ncould possibly changed their names, as was the custom at that time, to sound \r\nmore American.  The name and zip code that I pulled up are Harry Langsam Born \r\n1892, died May 1967  and the zip 11230 Brooklyn Kings NY.  Has anyone laid \r\nclaim to that branch?  The children of that Harry would be  close to 80 or \r\n85. My father-in-law's father probably was the eldest.  It would be \r\ninteresting to finally meet some relatives from my father-in-laws side.  I \r\nknow my husband, Saul and my sister-in-law Nina would be thrilled.\r\n          I guess I should tell you, I have 3 boys.  My eldest is 21 \r\n(Jeffrey) my middle is 19 (Andrew) and my youngest is 14(David)\r\n Funny how some of the same names keep cropping up.\r\n       If I can be of any more help or if you come across anything else, \r\nplease let me know.\r\n                                                    Marsha Langsam\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nFrom: SaulL123@aol.com \r\nDate: Sun, 16 Jan 2000 21:33:30 EST \r\nSubject: Re: langsam family \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\n\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n                   The information in the book by Susan Wynne is more than I \r\nwas able to find out.

The attached letter was written to Sam (Shaje) Langsam\r\nwhen he lived with my grandfather Harry (Hersh or Herse) on 23rd street\r\n(with my mother Emily and Uncle Bill--who is cc'd on this email). Of\r\nthe 4 brothers, Meyer, Abraham, Hersh and Shaje, Sam/Shaje either never\r\nmarried or was a widower--and lived with Harry (Hersh/Herse)in the\r\n1930's on 23rd street in Brooklyn. Meyer/Mendel died in the flu\r\npandemic of 1917. I don't know anything about Abe--perhaps Uncle Bill\r\ncould tell us. In any event, the attached letter was given to me in\r\n1978 by my mother when I was trying to figure out where the family came\r\nfrom. My mother did not know who the letter was from, except that it\r\nwas from family in Poland. She said that Uncle used to send packages to\r\nthe family. Well, I tried to have the letter translated by a co-worker\r\nwho was a Holocaust survivor in 1978--he started to cry when he read the\r\nletter--he said the letter was way too sad. I prevailed upon him to at\r\nleast tell me who the letter was from. (He did tell me that it was\r\nactually two letters). He wrote on the attachment that the letter was\r\nfrom: Her. Luser Langsam, Juriczkowa, Post Woitkowa, POW. Dobromil,\r\nPoland. Of course, my mother had no idea who Luser Langsam was--she\r\nthought he was a cousin. In reality, Luser Langsam was the 5th brother\r\nwho stayed behind in Poland. I believe Luser is your grandfather, Uncle\r\nBill's uncle, and Richard and mine, great uncle. I have no idea what\r\nthe rest of the letter says. Please see what you can do to have the\r\nletter translated (and let's share the info of course)--I am also trying\r\nfrom my end.

I do not know of any sisters of the Langsam brothers from \r\nJureczkowa. As far as any other survivors from this line, if they \r\ndid not come to the states, they perished in the holocaust.

To correct one person mentioned\r\nthat had lived with us was not Sam Langsam but Sam Wolf who was my\r\nmothers uncle.You can check this out with your mother who will i am sure\r\nwill remember. My farther had a cousin in the bronx who name was Abe\r\nlangsam and his wife was Molly Langsam. His brother who also lived in\r\nthe Bronx was also Abe Langsam had 2 children Caroline & Harold. Abe had\r\nlost one leg due to diabetes and my farther would help them as much has\r\nhe could.We have lost contact with them after my farther died but i\r\nremember them at my wedding. The Milton mentioned in Florida i believe\r\nwas my farthers cousin son Abe langsam. Sam Langsam I believe was never\r\nmarried. My farther had a cousin that wound up in Sweden that he helped\r\ncome to the U.S. He was in Pensylvania the last i remember.

I wanted to summarize everything for you, Richard and\r\nMitchell--and our cousins Saul and Marsha--who are cc'd on this email.\r\nMom had a terrific conversation with Marsha and I had a wonderful talk\r\nwith Saul. Here goes:\r\n\r\nBottom-line--we reconnected with the Langsam family--here are the\r\ndetails (this is a combination of what Richard and I learned from Mom,\r\npublic records, Saul and Marsha Langsam, my own recollection, and you):\r\n\r\n1. Grandpa (Pop) Harry was one of five brothers--Abraham/Abe,\r\nMeyer/Mendel, Shaje/Sam, Herse/Hersh/Harry and Louser (pronounced\r\nloo-ser). They were the children of Yacov and Leia (Kabalnik) Langsam,\r\nfrom the village of Jaretskowa/Jaricskowa in Galicia. Yacov's mother\r\nhad a farm and was better off than most--but Yacov, although very poor,\r\napparently never asked for help from his mother. Mom says that Pop once\r\ntold her that there were 4 sisters as well--but no one else knows of\r\nthat. They barely had enough to eat.\r\n\r\n2. Abe was the first one to come to America. He saved money and sent\r\nfor Grandpa/Pop. Then Grandpa saved money and sent for Meyer/Mendel and\r\nthen he also sent money to bring over Sam. Why Louser did not come over\r\nwe don't know. But I speculate he had some health problem and therefore\r\ncould not travel--but we don't know. The brothers left to avoid being\r\nconscripted into the army.\r\n\r\n3. Sam never married--and he lived by himself in the Bronx--I think.\r\nMeyer/Mendel died in the flu pandemic of 1917.\r\n\r\n4. Louser was married to Necha, stayed in Poland with Yacov. Grandma\r\nLeia, whose Hebrew name was probably Leia Kreindel-- died young--Mom\r\nbelieves that Grandpa Yacov may have actually lived until he was killed\r\nby the Nazis. The only thing I have found so far from them is the letter\r\nfrom 1938 which is being translated.\r\n\r\n5. Louser died before the war from some illness. He had children: Tzvi\r\nMordechai Langsam (survived), Israel Langsam - 1942; Moishe Langsam\r\n- 1942; Rachel Langsam - 1942; Aaron Langsam - 1942. Saul's father\r\n(Tzvi Mordecai?), was the only one to survive the war--from Dachau. I\r\nbelieve everyone else died in Auschwitz--but I don't know for sure. He\r\nwas sent to Sweden to a DP camp after the war, where he married Dora.\r\nHe is the nephew who made contact with Grandpa. Mom distinctly\r\nremembers sending packages to them in Sweden. Grandpa was not certain\r\nat first who exactly he was--but, he told Mom that this was a person in\r\nneed and they must help--even if he wasn't a relative. Eventually,\r\nGrandpa helped to bring them over to Philadelphia. Saul remembers\r\nvisiting Grandpa in an apartment. Mom believes they came to your\r\nwedding--do you have wedding pictures you could scan and send? Saul's\r\nfather was your and Mom's first cousin.\r\n\r\n6. The brother Abe you mention below was married to Sadie. His child\r\nHarold died young. Caroline Langsam married Bob? Schwartz--Mom doesn't\r\nthink she has an address--but we are working on that.\r\n\r\n7. The other cousins--Abe and Molly Langsam--Mom believes that part of\r\nthe family is from Romania--not far from Juretskowa--we are checking on\r\nthat. \r\n\r\n8. Uncle Bill--you could help if you have any addresses, phone numbers\r\nof any of the Langsams, old letters, photos, or anything else you can\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think it is very appropriate that this week--on Yom\r\nHashoah--we are reconnecting--and remembering those of our family who\r\ndied in the Holocaust. \r\n\r\nRegards to all! \r\n\r\n\r\nJeff\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Fine, Richard\" <RICHARD.Fine@tenethealth.com> \r\nSubject: RE: langsam family history \r\nDate: Thu, 5 May 2005 11:26:37 -0500 \r\nTo: \"Fine, Jeffrey\" <finej@HughesLuce.com>, \r\n\"william langson\" <billlbison@juno.com>, moishe@langsam.com \r\nCc: SaulL123@aol.com, mitchelldf@cs.com, Phf5825@aol.com, Buf11@aol.com, \r\nsfine@wam.umd.edu, daf81289@mac.com \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nJeff, thanks for summarizing all of this.

Some detail on this\r\nfamily is in my website. The exact page is:\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/h23.htm\r\n\r\nNotice the name BILLET as Mollie's surname. \r\n\r\nThe latest information I have for this tree is:\r\n1 H23 - unknown LANGSAM \r\n........ 2 Leah Langsam \r\n............ +Leibush Lustig \r\n................... 3 Ephraim Lustig \r\n................... 3 child Lustig \r\n................... 3 child Lustig \r\n................... 3 child Lustig \r\n................... 3 David Lustig \r\n............................. 4 Renee Lustig \r\n................................. +boy Aranoff \r\n........ 2 child Langsam \r\n................... 3 Abraham Langsam 1888 - 1961 of\r\nPrzemysl, Poland\r\n....................... +Mollie Billet \r\n............................. 4 Jack Langsam 1911 - 1971 \r\n................................. +Dorothy ? \r\n........................................ 5 William\r\nLangsam 1941 - \r\n............................................ +Wilma\r\nEpstein \r\n.................................................. 6\r\n  David Langsam 1964 - \r\n.................................................. 6\r\n  Debra Langsam 1967 - \r\n.................................................. 6 Adam\r\nLangsam 1968 - \r\n........................................ *2nd Wife of\r\nWilliam Langsam: \r\n............................................ +Linda ? \r\n............................. *2nd Wife of Jack Langsam: \r\n................................. +Judith ? \r\n........................................ 5 Andrew\r\nLangsam \r\n............................. 4 Milton Langsam \r\n\r\n\r\nI know that in 1985 William Langsam was in Insurance and\r\nlived in Long Island. Looking in switchboard, I find only\r\none William Langsam in all of NY. He is in Long Island, at\r\n38 Stone Hill Dr S \r\nManhasset, NY 11030-4426\r\n(516) 365-4343 \r\n\r\nIf you follow-up with him, please let me know what happens.\r\nI called him several times a few years ago, but we never\r\nactually spoke.\r\n\r\nI also have a question. You state that \"Louser died before\r\nthe war from some illness\", while the Langsam-Spira book\r\nstates that he perished in the Holocaust. Can this be\r\nclarified any further?\r\n\r\nRegarding Rich's comments, first let me once again thank\r\nhim for his very kind words. As for the Langsam manifests\r\nfrom Ellis Island, I have most of them. Let me know which\r\nones you would like and if I can email large files to you\r\nand I will send them.\r\n\r\nAs for the number of living Langsam descendents, I do not\r\nhave a current count. What I can tell you is that Pesach\r\nLangsam, our earliest known ancestor, has over 14,000 known\r\ndescendents. I am still computerizing the families, but\r\nalready have data-entered over 11,600 people. This spans\r\neleven generations. \r\n\r\nCan you identify all the new email addresses on this note?\r\n\r\n-Moishe\r\n \r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: william langson <billlbison@juno.com> \r\nSubject: langson family tree \r\nDate: Sat, 7 May 2005 22:57:21 -0700 \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com,finej@HughesLuce.com,RICHARD.Fine@tenethealth.com \r\n   \r\nThank you very much for all the information you have\r\nprovided to my nephews about our family.
