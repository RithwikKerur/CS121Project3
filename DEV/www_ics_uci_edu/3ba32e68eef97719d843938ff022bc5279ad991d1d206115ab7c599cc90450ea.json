Goodrich</b> <BR> \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/teach/ics8/\">\n\t  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/teach/ics8/</a> <BR>\nFall 2010 <br>\n</center>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Course description.</b>\nPrinciples of practical computer security to enable students to\ndefend themselves against malicious threats. Firewalls, anti-virus,\nsecure setup of a wireless access point. Cryptography basics and its\napplication. Embedded devices and related security issues.\nNetwork technologies and their vulnerabilities.\n<li><b>Course goals.</b>\nAll students, and most of the general population, use computers and\ncomputer-based systems everyday, and entrust those systems with\nlife-critical and cost-critical functions. In spite of the high level\nof trust placed in computer-based systems, even advanced computer\nusers have little awareness of their exposure to security threats.\nThe general lack of understanding of basic computer security concepts\nleads to increased risk and costs involved in using computers. This\ncourse will introduce computer security basics in a practical way and\ngive students the understanding that they need to protect themselves,\nand their data, from malicious attack.\nStudents will learn about the mechanisms behind most computer attacks\nand they will learn about standard defense tools including firewalls\nand anti-virus programs. The course will provide a practical\nintroduction to a broad range of computer security topics.\n<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of homeworks and\nquizes, a midterm exam, and a comprehensive final exam. The overall grade\nwill be determined as follows:\n<ul>\n<li>\n5% from attendance and participation,\n<li>\n15% from quizes,\n<li>\n20% from homeworks,\n<li>\n30% from the midterm, \n<li>\n30% from the final.\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Cheating policy.</b>\nPerformance must be 100% individual effort on all quizes and exams,\nthat is,\nno collaboration is allowed on quizes or exams.  Any collaboration or copying \nwill be considered cheating.\nGroup work on homeworks is permitted, but each\nstudent must list his or her collaborators in writing for each\nproblem, using a phrase like \"In collaboration with Jane Doe...\".\nIf a student turns in a solution without listing\nthe others who helped produce this solution,\nthis act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).\nLate homework assignments will not be accepted without a medical or\nother life-emergency excuse.\nIn addition to the procedures of the\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/cheat.html\">ICS \nCheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating will be given a \nzero on the homework, quiz or exam in question and have a letter filed\nwith their associate dean for academic affairs.\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Text.</b>  Goodrich and Tamassia,\n<i>Introduction to Computer Security</i>, \nAddison-Wesley, 2011. \n</li>\n\n<li><b>Add/drop policy.</b> \nDrops will be accepted only up to the end of the third week.\nOnce your drop card has been\nsigned, further coursework from you will not be graded. After the\nseventh week of classes, withdrawals will be allowed only by\npetition and under documented extenuating circumstances.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Week 1:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nIntroduction. \nSecurity principles, access control models,\nbasic cryptographic concepts. <li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 1.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li><b>Week 2:</b></li>\n<ul>\n<li>\nPhysical Security.\nLocks, smart cards, RFIDs, eavesdropping, computer forensics.\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 2.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>Week 3:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nOperating Systems Security.\nMonitoring, filesystem security, buffer-overflow attacks.\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 3.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>Week 4:</b></li>\n<ul>\n<li>\nMalware.\nLogic bombs, Trojan horses, viruses, worms, rootkits, adware,\nspyware.\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 4.\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>Week 5:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nNetwork Security I.\nBasic Internet technology, spoofing, sniffing, session hijacking,\ndenial-of-service, botnets.\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 5.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>Week 6:</b></li>\n<ul>\n<li>\nNetwork Security II.\nDNS, indruders, firewalls, wireless security.\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 6.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<li>\n<b>Week 7:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nWeb Browser Security.\nphishing, cross-site scripting attacks,\ntracking cookies, privacy.\n</li>\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 7.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>Week 8:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nCryptography.\nSymmetric encryption, public-key cryptography, hash functions,\ndigital signatures.\n</li>\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 8.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>Week 9:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nApplications I.\nEmail, payment systems.\n</li>\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 10, part 1.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li>\n<b>Week 10:</b>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nApplications II.\nVoting systems, digital rights management, social networking.\n</li>\n<li>Reading: G-T, Chapter 10, part 2.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>\n<p>\nCopyright &copy 2010\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/\">\nMichael T.
