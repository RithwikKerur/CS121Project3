Its \nimportance is of both academic and commercial interests.  This research \nproject will focus on the emergence of commercial uses for the web.  \nSpecific areas that will be addressed will include:  what is available \nnow, how accessible are businesses, how electronic transactions will be \nconducted, and finally how on-line \nbusiness advertise that is different than that of regular businesses.\n<p>\n\tTo begin with, there are many limiting factors to doing business \non the internet.  These factors limit how much can actually be conveyed \nover the electronic lines.  For instance, there is the issue of \naccessibility.  Not everyone has a computer or even regular access to one.  \nThis severely limits the size of your potential customer base.  On the \nother hand this market is rapidly growing.\n<p>\n\tSecondly, if you do have access to a personal computer or access to a\ndirect internet connection, the capabilities of browsers are limiting\nfactors as well.  For instance, navigating the world wide web can be\ndemanding because of the direct link required to run powerful\nbrowsers like Mosaic.  Mosaic provides an excellent interface, however,\naccess to this program is severely limited.  Even beyond the \naccessibility problem, the\navailability of add-on's to browsers are another factor.  Add-on's entitle\nthe browser to sound or graphic display capabilities.  Any of these add-\nons can change the way in which information is conveyed over the computer\nterminal. \n<p>\n\tLastly, searching the World Wide Web can be cumbersome.  Until \nrecently and the introduction of search engines such as <a \nhref=\"http://www.rpi.edu./~decemj/cmc/mag/1994/sep/spiders.html\">Harvest \nand Lycos,</a> \ngathering information was a very tedious task.  These engines will help \nusers find information that is valuable and allow people to \"surf\" the web \nmuch faster and more efficiently.\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Electronic cash</h2>\n\nWith the emergence of making transactions over the network, one form of \n<a href=\"http://www.digicash.com/ecashinfo/general.html#whatis\">\"electronic \ncash\"</a> <img src=\"http://www.digicash.com/ecash/shops/_dc.gif\"> has  \nbeen created to help facilitate anonymous payments, \n\"just as if both parties shared the same room.\"  Abbreviated as \n<i>ecash</i>, this system was developed by <a \nhref=\"http://www.digicash.com/company/digicash.html\">DigiCash Inc.</a>, and \nis a software solution for payment rather than the  \ntraditional use of money.  Making transactions using ecash can be made \neasily, privately and safely due to advances in <a  \nhref=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?cryptography\">cryptography. \n</a>  \n<p>\nThe use of this electronic payment system is considered more \nsecure than giving your credit card to a waiter in a restaurant, \nbecause \"electronic cash is digitally 'signed' by the issuer\" and \nprocessed immediately.  \nPrivacy is an inherent part of the system because unlike paper cash, \nelectronic cash is virtually untraceable.  However, users can easily \nprove if they did or did not make a payment, making fraudulent \nactivities almost non-existent.  Payment can be made from any computer \nconnected to the internet when coupled with the use of a special client  \nprogram. \n<p>\n<i>Ecash</i> is a form of currency that is currently being beta \ntested and is very possible of being widely used by many vendors on \nthe net because of its advantages.  In order for the ecash system to  \nwork, 4 parties are needed: 1) an issuing bank that will exchange real  \nmoney for ecash; 2) users who will spend the ecash; 3) vendors who will  \naccept ecash as payment for goods and services; and 4) banks that will clear \npayments received from vendors.  \n<p>\n\"Virtual retail stores\" such \nas <a href=\"http://www.digicash.com/digishop/shopmain.html\">DigiCash \nCybershops</a> are already accepting ecash as payment.  For example, \nthere's a games shop where you can play simple games like Tic Tac Toe \nonline, and if you win, you get ecash back.  <a \nhref=\"http://www.dds.nl/~tsoc/tsoc.html\">The Samaritans of Cheltenham and \nDistrict</a> is a charitable organization in the U.K. that accepts real \nmoney or ecash as donations.\n<p> \nWith already the existence of \"virtual retail stores\" like \nthe ones located inside <a href=\"http://virtualmall.com\">Virtual Mall,</a>, \nproduct ordering has not been well established yet, but orders can be \nprinted to a printerat the vendor's site, emailing, or appending the order \nto a text file.  For example, when ordering a pizza from <a \nhref=\"http://www.pizzahut.com\">Pizza Hut</a>, you provide your name, \naddress, and phone number, and if your area (determined from your area \ncode) is being serviced, then you will be presented with a menu with \npull-down fields.  The order will then be emailed to a server, which will \nthen be forwarded to the local location.\n<p>\nAn experimental grocery store called <a \nhref=\"http://rainer.bnt.com/htbin/wa\">Wane's Online Grocery Store</a> \nallows you to grab a shopping cart and go into different \"aisles\" where \nyou can choose items you want to purchase.  It keeps a running total of \nyour purchases.  When you're ready to checkout, just hit the \"cash register\" \nbutton, and you can pay for your groceries using ecash.\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Advertising on the net</h2>\n\nWith a growing number of net-users, businesses have made \nthe move toward targeting the massive market of web \nenthusiasts.  In todays age, people are learning to use the \nweb and its resources as a tool to achieve increased \nproductivity.  Users are spending more and more of their work \nand spare time on the network.  Thus it only makes sense for \nadvertisers to target this population.  \n<p>     \n     With the advent of the mass media engines, advertisers \nhave been able to efficiently target their audience to both \nlower the cost of advertising and to reach the intended \naudience.  Previous to the advent of the net, television, \nnewspapers and magazines, and the radio were the general \nmediums for advertisements.  The use of these forums, \nalthough streamlined in recent years, is somewhat clumsy as \nfar as targeting the intended audience.  \n<p>     \n     For instance, have you ever sat down to eat dinner \nand see a Tampax commercial come on.  Or been in the middle of watching \na football game and been bombarded with advertisements for toothpaste.   \nWhere's the connection?   Well, their isn't one.\nThat's the point.  There is nothing to say that an armchair sports \nanalyzer isn't a consumer of toothpaste, in fact he is.  But \nwouldn't it be better to try and appeal to this man's hygiene \nneeds in the morning when he's waking up?  Of course it would.  \nBut that's one of the fundamental problems of television \nadvertising.  Target audience.\n<p>     \n     With net advertising, these problems are simply \nnon-existent. If commercials were free, or at least nearly so, \nthen there would be no problem with inefficient ads.  The \ncompany could literally saturate the media with images of their \nproduct and either people would start buying it, or Congress \nwould pass legislation to ban it.  With net advertising, you get \nthe best of both worlds.  \n<p>     \n     Net ads cost virtually nothing to run, and can easily be \neither sent to people linked to the net, or be placed in strategic \n\"locations\" on the web.  In this manner, companies can reach the \ngrowing audience of net-surfers and solicit their products.  \nVirtual malls also provide an excellent forum for net \"browsers\" \nto see the wide array of products available through the web.  \n<p>     \n     In a particular \"virtual mall\" called <a href=\"http://virtumall.com\"> \nVirtumall</a> users can browse \nthrough a variety of products, ranging from air freshener to cars to dog \nbiscuits.  One particularly interesting shop was the <a \nhref=\"http://virtumall.com/goinggreek/goinggreek.html\">Going Greek Store \n</a>that specializes in the sales of clothing that's tailored to campus \nclubs \nand greek letter organizations.  The order form is attractively designed \nwith pictures of almost all of the products so you can see exactly what \nis being offered.  \n<p>\nThe cyber mall shopper can enjoy just \"walking\" through the \nmall, or if they get the urge to buy, there are usually complete order \nforms at the bottom of the advertisement.  This is a form that is similar \nto the Home Shopping Network, however on a more personal and easier level.  \nUsers of the mall don't \neven have to wait for the product to change on the screen.  They can \nmove through the mall freely, switching the type of products \nthey view or scroll along among the same types of products to \nfind the brand that pleases them. \n<p>     \n     Most computer companies have web pages set up to provide \nservice and support for the users of their products.  <a \nhref=\"http://www.apple.com\">Apple Computer's home page</a>\n<img src=\"http://www.apple.com/images/mainheader.gif\"> \nis an excellent example of \nthis.  Through this format, Apple can display many of their new \nproducts to users that are obviously interested in them.  Some \nof the formats include: <a \nhref=\"http://www.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/prodspec-pl?/PowerBooks/PowerBook.520c\">\nshowrooms</a> that usually give a picture of the product and a brief sales \npitch, <a\nhref=\"http://www.info.apple.com/cgi-bin/lister-pl?Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates\">\nsoftware updates and lists</a>, and quicktime movies .  Consumers can get \nthe information on the products they are interested in without sitting  \nthrough general purpose, image boosting commercials that \nreally give very little product information.  In this way, users can find \nthe information they need quickly and efficiently, which will very likely  \ntranslate into greater future sales and higher customer satisfaction. \n<p>     \n     Companies like <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com\">IBM</a>, advertise a large \nvariety of their hardware, and even provide an option to order \nover the net, an invaluable tool for impulsive buyers. \n<p>     \n    On our school systems, the sound capabilities are minimal, \nbut I'm told that the web is in full multimedia context--\ngraphics, sound, motion--just like television.  For years, \nadvertisers have used appealing graphics and sounds to entice an \nunwary public into purchasing their products.  Now, even the net \nis not exempt from this type of brainwashing.    \n<p>     \n     Some products that can be used over the computer, such as \nthose that are composed entirely of \ngraphics, have even more elaborate selling schemes.  For \nsome reason or another, there is no way to censor the \nmaterial that goes over the lines, which gives companies \nlike <a href=\"http://www.playboy.com\">Playboy</a><img \nsrc=\"http://www.playboy.com/images/bunny_square.gif\">, a \nbrilliant way to advertise their products.  By giving <a \nhref=\"http://www.playboy.com/playmates/playmate-dec94.html\">\"samples\"</a> \nover the internet, the viewer is baited to the product.  Furthermore, \nsuch an interface allows the user to be interactive and actually \nparticipate in many aspects of the magazine, including submitting \narticles and giving comments to the publisher.\n<p>\n     There are many ways that advertisers are using and will use \nthe web in the future to make products both more available \nand desirable to consumers, but they are far too numerous to \ngo into detail ere.  In short, the web is a \npowerful business tool as well as a source of information and \nentertainment.  Just as the television is able to bring us shows via \nadvertising funds, perhaps the same will soon be true for \nthe net.  Maybe in the future, advertising will pay for our \nentertainment as well as our research.       \n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
