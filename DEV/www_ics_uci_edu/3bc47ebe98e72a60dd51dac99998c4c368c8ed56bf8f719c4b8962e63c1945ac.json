Are we trying to simply put versioning capabilities\n     in HTTP, are we trying to put *a* versioning capability in HTTP, are\n     we trying to seamlessly integrate versioning and non-version aware\n     clients/servers,etc. It looks like the group needs an objective very much;\n     this in itself could be an interesting exercise, because I think we\n     will be able to identify multiple layers of functionality that can be\n     built on top of eachother.\n\n   * An a start (?), to me, putting versioning into HTTP means to put\nversioning\n     facilities into HTTP, that allow version-aware clients/servers to\n     implement a particular versioning strategy suitable to their needs.\n     Thus, capabilities like LOCK and UNLOCK are needed as predicates, but\n     do not necessarily need to be used. An RCS like implementation of\n     versioning of web-pages would use it, David's approach would not.\n     Identifying the facilities is a big challenge that I see the group should\n     get in to. So, a first start could be to start identifying the major\n     predicates needed to implement versioning policies (I hate to refer to\n     own work, but to understand where my thoughts are coming from: we at\n     Colorado are working on a similar approach to Configuration Management,\n     not specifically tied to the WWW, Jim's page contains a reference).\n\n   * Thus, I like to make a distinction between versioning in HTTP, which is\n     a communication protocal, and versioning of web-pages, which is a much\n     higher level problem. It seems like the two are getting confused in some\n     of the earlier messages.\n\nBefore I start rambling too much (which I probably already did), I think the\ngroup needs to have a common set of goals, possibly layered in some\nhierarchical plan of attack, as well as a clear separation between versioning\nfeatures in HTTP, and higher level issues.\n\nRegards,\n\n=== Andre ===\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0042.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Versioning Thoughts (in HTML)\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0040.html\">David G.
