These structures are\nmore space-efficient than conventional pointer-based representations,\nbut (to within a constant factor) they are just as timeefficient\nfor traversal operations. For trees, the data structures\ndescribed here are asymptotically optimal: there is no other structure\nthat encodes n-node trees with fewer bits per node, as n\ngrows without bound. For planar graphs (and for all graphs of\nbounded pagenumber), the data structure described uses linear\nspace: it is within a constant factor of the most succinct representation.\n\n<p>\n(Based on a paper by \nGuy Jacobson)\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
