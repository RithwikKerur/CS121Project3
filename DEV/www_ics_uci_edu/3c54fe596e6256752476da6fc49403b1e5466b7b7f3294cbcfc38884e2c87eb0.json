Our algorithm produces greedy\ndrawings, which support greedy geometric routing, so that a message M\nbetween any pair of vertices may be routed geometrically, simply by\nhaving each vertex that receives M pass it along to any neighbor\nthat is closer in the hyperbolic metric to the message's eventual\ndestination. More importantly, for networking applications, our\nalgorithm produces succinct drawings, in that each of the vertex\npositions in one of our embeddings can be represented using O(log n)\nbits and the calculation of which neighbor to send a message to may\nbe performed efficiently using these representations. These properties\nare useful, for example, for routing in sensor networks, where storage\nand bandwidth are limited.\n</p>\n<p>\nJoint work with David Eppstein.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
