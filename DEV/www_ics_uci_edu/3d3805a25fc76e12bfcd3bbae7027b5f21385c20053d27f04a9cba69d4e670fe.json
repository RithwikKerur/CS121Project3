Is the formula still valid for planar graphs that are not connected? Why or why not?</p>\n<li><p>What is the worst-case running time of the Bellman&ndash;Ford algorithm when its input is a planar graph? You should express your answer in O-notation as a function only of the number <i>n</i> of vertices; do not include the number <i>m</i> of edges in your answer.</p></li>\n</ol>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
