It was only a month or two ago that I re-listed\nall the vertex-figures of the archimedean 4-polytopes (not that I\nhave the list here now, of course), and it's easy to see that not\ntoo many of them include regular skew polygons among the edges of\ntheir vertex figures.  \n\n   I see the English of that got a bit mixed up, since \"vertex figures\"\nwas already the subject of the subordinate clause, but you see what I\nmean anyway.\n\n   I should imagine that a better way to find examples would be to\nfirst find the maps in abstracto, then do the eigenvalue-type graph\ntheory to find their embeddings, which might be in quite high-dimensional\nspaces.\n\n   For example, letting  1,A,B,C  be the maps that take the typical\nvertex of an icosahedron to itself, the sum of its neighbors, the\nsum of the neighbors of its antipode, and its antipode, we find:\n\n     A^2 = 5 + 2A + 2B,  BA = 2A + 2B + 5C,  CA = B\n\nso  (A^3 - 2A^2 - 5A) = 2BA = 2A + (A^2-5-2A) + C,   so\n\nNo!  error!                 = 4A + 2(A^2-5-2A) + 10C, so\n\n    (A^3 - 4A^2 - 5A + 10) = 10C  if I'm not mistaken, so\n\n    A^4 - 4A^3 - 5A^2 + 10A = 10B = 5A^2 - 10A - 25,  or\n\n      (1,-4,-10,20,25)(A) = 0,  which I factorize:\n       1 -5\n          1  -5\n             -5 25\n                -5 25    as  (A-5)(A^3 + A^2 - 5A - 5)\n\n    ie.,   (A-5)(A+1)(A^2-5) = 0\n\nSo the eigenvalues of  A  are   5, -1, r5, -r5      (r5 = sqrt(5))\n\nwith multiplicities found as    1   5   3    3\n\n   So the icosahedron has 4 irreducible \"regular representations\",\nnamely the trivial one, the one in which opposite vertices coincide\nto give the vertices of a regular 5-simplex, the standard 3-dimensional\none, and the conjugate 3-dimensional one in which it becomes the\ngreat icosahedron.\n\n     You could now mix these a bit, for instance getting an 8-dimensional\nrepresentation by adding a 5 and a 3.  (Since there's a scale parameter\ninvolved, this actually gives a 1-parameter family of such representations.)\n\n    In general, if the permutation character involves k distinct\nirreducibles, you get k basic representations this way (which, as in the\nabove case, may not all be faithful), and then as far as I can see\nyou can just take any linear combination of them to get the most\ngeneral regular embedding.  However, I'm not quite sure what happens\nwhen the character isn't multiplicity-free.  I must work out the\ndodecahedron as prototype.\n\n            JHC\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
