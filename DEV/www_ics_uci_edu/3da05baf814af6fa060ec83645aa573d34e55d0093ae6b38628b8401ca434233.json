If you have to miss lecture for any\r\nreason, please ask one of your classmates to fill you\r\nin on what you missed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are two discussion sections for this class. Each section meets one hour per\r\nweek. This is an important time to get questions answered about homework\r\nproblems. No new content will be given in discussion, but you are highly encouraged to\r\nattend as it will give valuable practice on problems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Obtaining Assistance</h3>\r\nThe best way to get your questions answered is by coming\r\nto lecture, office hours or discussion and asking them there.\r\nIn general,\r\nif I'm not busy with something else, I am happy to answer\r\nshort questions while I am in my office, so feel free to\r\nstop by during other times in the week.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nYou can also email me with question related to the course.\r\nHowever, if the question requires a long response, I am likely to ask you\r\nto come see  me to discuss in person.\r\nPlease use your uci or ics email accounts when sending me email related to the course.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor questions about grading on  homework, please contact the course reader, Zana Ghaderi.\r\nYou can come to me with questions about grading on tests.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<H3>Course Announcements</H3>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>Course announcements will be sent via email to all students enrolled\r\nin the class, at their official UCI email address.\r\n<LI>\r\n<A  href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/Y14/36540/\">Click here</A> for the\r\narchive of these messages.\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Homework and Quizes</h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA test will be given every Wednesday of the course, except for the first week.\r\nThose dates are: July 2, 9, 16, 23.\r\nThe tests will be given at the end of lecture and will last approximately 30-40\r\nminutes. In calculating your grade, I use only the top  three scores from the four tests.\r\nIn exchnage for this, <b>I give absolutely no make up exams, regardless of the reason</b>.\r\nIt is understandable, that there are sometimes circumstances beyond your control that\r\nmake it necessary to miss a test. The dropped test is designed to cover one\r\nsuch occasion. In a densely packed 5-week quarter, we can only accommodate one missed\r\ntest.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHomework is due every Monday and Friday, except for the first day of class and July 4.\r\nYou will notice that the homework counts very little towards your grade.\r\nIt is important to do the homework because it enables you to learn the material but a missed\r\nhomework will not have a big effect on your grade.\r\n<strong> Absolutely no late homework assignments will be accepted.\r\n</strong>.\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrades for the assignements and quizes will be posted through EEE.\r\nIf you have questions regarding grading, please see one of the readers.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Text</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis quarter you will be using a web-based interactive, animated offering as your \"textbook\".\r\nYou are required to have an account for the course. The material\r\nincludes interactive\r\nexercises which will count towards your grade.\r\nThe directions for subscribing can be found at:\r\n<ol><li> Go to <a href=\"https://zybooks.zyante.com/#/zybooks\">https://zybooks.zyante.com/#/zybooks</a>.\r\nBookmark this site - this is your site for the entire quarter.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nYou will need a\r\ncredit card or Paypal account to pay the subscription price of $35.\r\nNote: a Paypal account is not required.\r\nIf you don't have a credit card or a Paypal account, contact <a href=\"mailto:support@zyante.com\">\r\nsupport@zyante.com</a>.\r\nContact <a href=\"mailto:support@zyante.com\">\r\nsupport@zyante.com</a> for help or with any questions regarding obtaining a subscription.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Course Structure</h3>\r\n\r\nThe grading criteria for the course is:\r\n<ul>\r\nHomework 5%<br/>\r\nReading Assignments 4%<br/>\r\nTests 60%<br>\r\nFinal 30%<br>\r\nCompleting the Course Evaluation 1%<br>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that there is a tiny bit of credit given for completing the course evaluation towards the\r\nend of the quarter. It is\r\navailable through <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/\"> EEE </a> and is\r\nusually released a couple  weeks from the end of the quarter.\r\nIf enough students complete the evaluation then I have access to the list of students\r\nwho completed the evaluation. However, I do not see any evaluation results until the\r\nquarter is over and grades have been turned in. Even after the quarter when I do\r\nsee the evaluation results, they are completely anonymous. Thus, there is no risk\r\nto you in being completely honest in your evaluation. I take these evaluations very\r\nseriously and use them to improve my teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H3>Missed Midtern or Final Exam Policy</H3>\r\nThe time and location of the final exam will be announced soon.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> If you miss the final exam and do not have a valid reason, you will receive\r\na score of 0 on the exam.\r\n<LI> The following policy applies if you miss the final exam for a valid reason.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>\r\nThere are only two classes of valid reasons for missing the final exam:\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>  An unforeseeable emergency, such as a medical emergency.\r\nIn such cases I will ask for documentation.\r\n<LI> An absence from an exam due to a foreseeable circumstance\r\nthat I have approved in advance.\r\n</OL>\r\n<LI>\r\nA work conflict or a family vacation is NOT a valid reason for missing the final exam.\r\n<LI> If you wait until after the exam to get a foreseeable excuse approved,\r\nand it is not approved,\r\nyou will receive a grade of zero (0) on the exam.\r\n<LI> If I accept your reason for missing the final exam, at my option I may\r\neither (1) give you a makeup exam or (2) assign your grade on the basis\r\nof the remaining course work that you did not miss.\r\n<LI> If I give a makeup exam, I may give it less weight\r\nthan announced on the course web page.\r\n</UL>\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>\r\n    <p>The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established an academic honesty policy. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">Read it.</a></p>\r\n    <p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n    <h4>Guidelines to avoid plagarism:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>Do not look at another person's homework.</b>\r\n      Instead you should prefer to discuss the problem in plain English.\r\n      This helps you to communicate clearly, practice technical jargon as it applies to your problem, and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior different from what you expect.\r\n      <li><b>Do not write down the solution in your notes.</b>\r\n      It is perfectly fine (and encouraged) to collborate on work.\r\n      Working in a group is a rewarding experience, and definitely a necessary skill in any professional career.\r\n      The collaboration can include drawing diagrams and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard.\r\n      However, you should avoid writing the solution in your notes.\r\n      It is very useful to rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you solve it again on your own.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>We expect that:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among yourselves.</b> Making sure that others follow these guidelines will help to ensure that they don't pass off your work as their own.</p>\r\n      <li><b>Your work honestly represents your efforts.</b> The entire purpose of obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of skills and experience that will help you later on. If you do not perform the work yourself, then you have cheated yourself out of the education. Employers in our field can (and do) screen applicants for skills and knowledge. You will perform poorly (and discredit UCI) if you do not practice now by doing your own work.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
