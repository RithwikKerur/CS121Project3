(The notion of ASP as a new class of problems was first\nintroduced by Ueda and Nagao.) In this paper we consider n-ASP, the problem\nto find another solution when n solutions are given. In particular we\nconsider ASP-completeness, the completeness with respect to the parsimonious\nreductions which allow polynomial-time transformation of solutions. As an\napplication, we prove the ASP-completeness (which implies NP-completeness) of\nthree popular puzzles: Slither Link, Cross Sum, and Number Place.  \n\n<p>\n(Based on a paper by Takayuki Yato and Takahiro Seta in IEICE transactions on\nfundamentals of electronics, communications and computer sciences)\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
