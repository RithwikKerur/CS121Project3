My only\r\ninformation on Langsam comes from the family tree  put together by Susan\r\nWynne et al.  But, while it is very broad reaching, I found yours easier to\r\nfollow  obviously because of its narrowness but also because there is more\r\ndetail. For the first time I was able easily to go straight back to Pesach\r\nthrough Chaim Lieb.\r\n\r\n My grandmother was Cila Raff,  her mother was Ethel Fish,  Ethels father\r\nwas Mendel  Fish who was  Miriam Langsam's son,\r\n\r\nMy grandmother had a number of siblings. Some of whom are in the Fish and\r\nthe Langsam.Spira  family tree. However her father married twice and there\r\nwere other siblings from the second marriage whose names we do not know.\r\nCila had a brother who ended up in the USA . His name mayhave been Martin\r\nRaff.\r\n\r\nThis is all very exciting and I shall keep watching your pages for more\r\ndevelopments.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, despite my Irish name, I am a sabra born in Haifa in 1943 but\r\nlived most of my life in Australia.\r\n\r\nI am writing a novel at the moment and part of it is  set in the forests of\r\neaster Poland  during World War II. As you probably know there were a\r\nnumber of Jewish partisan camps and if you know of anybody who would help\r\nme with experiences of this time and place - I would  be extremely\r\ngrateful.\r\n\r\nKind regards\r\nEileen Naseby\r\n___________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: Eileen Naseby &lt;eileen@filmworld.com.au&gt;\r\nTo: 'moishe@langsam.com' &lt;moishe@langsam.com&gt;\r\nCc: 'dcthrelfo@telstra.easymail.com.au' &lt;dcthrelfo@telstra.easymail.com.au&gt;\r\nSubject: RE: Langsam Family\r\nDate: Tuesday, January 04, 2000 12:33 AM\r\n\r\nThanks for this Moishe\r\n\r\nMy info at this stage  has been the Langsam family tree. I went to Poland \r\nin October ( a long way from Sydney) and visited Dynov where my grandmother \r\nwas born. The Jewish cemetries were, of course, empty of headstones. Yet it \r\nwas a very moving experience. I intend to go back to do some further \r\nresearch so maybe  I will come up with further information when I  have \r\nmore time. I  am writing a novel which is totally fiction but the \r\ncharacters are loosely based on my mother and grandmother. So because the \r\nnovel  research was my main purpose in going to Poland ( and then to \r\nJerusalem) I had little time for things of a genealogical nature.\r\n\r\nAccording to yours and Susanne's family tree the following is my lineage\r\n\r\nPesach Langsam\r\nChaim Leib\r\nMiriam Langsam\r\nMendel Fish\r\nEthel Fish - Hirsch Raff\r\nCila  Raff - Solomon Singer\r\nUrsula Singer - Anthony Piercy\r\nEileen Piercy - David  Naseby\r\nNigel and Toby Naseby\r\n\r\nMy mother, Ursula's, second marriage to Nigel Hall produced five children\r\nDiana, Charmian, Stephen, Naomi, Michael\r\n\r\n\r\nI can see this all could become very addictive\r\nCheers and Happy New Year\r\nEileen Naseby\r\n\r\n\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom:\tmoishe@langsam.com [SMTP:moishe@langsam.com]\r\nSent:\tSaturday, 1 January 2000 7:33\r\nTo:\teguzik1@aol.com; naomi-g@MSN.COM; sanfordkap@aol.com; Solalr@juno.com; \r\neileen@filmworld.com.au; mwerg@mindspring.com; missaque@aol.com; \r\nalenko@netspace.net.au\r\nSubject:\tLangsam Family\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nAll of us are researching the Langsam family.

My grandfather's 1st cousin was Abraham RAFF\r\n(watchmaker) and his father was Hirsh Raff.  He last lived in Prsymersyl\r\n(excuse spelling - too lazy to look it up). Eileen told me that good old\r\nHersh RAFF was married twice, but knows nothing of the first marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nI made contact with my dad's first cousin a couple of year's ago.  In our\r\nphone conversation, he mentioned that my grandfather had told him that the\r\nRAFFs were once known as FISH/FISCH.  The story made no sense, and I decided\r\nthe whole thing was pretty 'fishy'.  I than chanced on this Ethel FISH RAFF,\r\nand the story seemed to have more credence.  I now think that maybe this\r\nAbraham RAFF, not my grandfather, told the cousin that story.  I guess it\r\nturned out to be true, but I don't think for my branch of the family.  My\r\nRAFFs were associated with the SICHERMAN name.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Eilenn Naseby of Australia at eileen@filmworld.com.au , many of\r\nher relatives were watchmakers, also.  She has a Bukowsko connection, so I\r\nfigured there must be a relationship of some type.  I didn't see her family\r\ntree, until I met her in L.A.  Her RAFF branch seems to have made a pitstop\r\nin Israel before immigrating to Australia.  She was born in Palestine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, it looks like you have a new email address to add.  Eileen is a real\r\ninteresting person.  She was to have completed her first novel in January,\r\nwhich is loosely based on her grandmother.  She was not brought up in a\r\nreligious home and her sister and her mom seem to have become members of the\r\nBahai faith.  I don't know if she has ever been in a synagogue.  She owns a\r\nfilm company, which rents historical video footage to film productions, etc.\r\nDebbie \"A watched clock never boils!\"\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: moishe@langsam.com <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nTo: Debbie Raff <seraff@sprintmail.com>\r\nDate: Monday, January 17, 2000 8:58 AM\r\nSubject: Re: The Importance of the JewishGen Family Finder\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n>Hi,\r\n>Actually, your note made perfect sense.

I found \r\nit pretty strange, actually, to be reading all of this.  One of those \"Twilight \r\nZone\" moments.  I still wish I could figure out my connection to the grand scheme \r\nof the Langsam world.  I did note that I mentioned that my grandfather's cousin, \r\nAbraham RAFFs father was named Hersch, yet as I now recall, I think I settled on \r\nHenoch in the end.  So, my prior info. that he may be the \"lost\" brother to Eileen, \r\nthe Aussie's grandmother, may or may not be the case.  Eileen was to ask some \r\nquestions on this matter after our L.A. meeting, but I don't know if this ever \r\nhappened.\r\n \r\nAnyway, I just thought I would touch base.  BTW, will you be going to London?  If \r\nso, let me know, and I will be on the look-out for you.  I did go to the Boston \r\nconvention years ago, and always had the intention of going to others, but my summer \r\nvacations seemed to get in the way.  \r\n\r\nDebbie ~ http://raff.50megs.com\r\n  \"Ms Raff's Cyber-Classroom\"\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 8/27/01</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
