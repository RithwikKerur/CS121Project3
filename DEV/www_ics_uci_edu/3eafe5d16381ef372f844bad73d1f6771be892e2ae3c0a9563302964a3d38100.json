You\ndon't need to explicitly present your outline to your audience (as\nthis takes up precious time), but you should keep your outline\nin your mind as you prepare and present your talk.\nThe following list gives a generic outline for a technical \nresearch talk:\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<b>  Introduction</b>. Motivate the problem being presented. Describe\nthe essential issues and why this problem is important.\n\n<li>\n<b>Previous work.</b> Describe related previous work and how it\nrelates to this work being presented. Refer to previous papers using\nthe last-name and year.\n\n<li>\n<b>New contributions.</b> Concisely present the main, new results\nthat this research contributed.\n\n<li>\n<b>Details.</b> Go into a reasonable amount of detail describing the\nnew work, how it functions, why it is correct, and why it is better\nthan the previous, including theoretical and experimental analysis,\nas appropriate. Rule-of-thumb: if a proof needs to go for more than\n1-2 slides, then this proof needs to be broken down into separate lemmas.\n\n<li>\n<b>Conclusion</b>.\nWrap up by reminding the audience what was contributed in this work.\nAlso, include possible directions for future work.\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n<h2>General Recommendations</h2>\n<p>\nOne can gain audience interest and comprehension by using the\nfollowing techniques:\n<ol>\n<li>\nTry to include a picture, figure, or diagram on every slide.\n<li>\nTry to anticipate what questions your audience will have and be ready\nwith bullet points or slides to address them.\n<li>\nHave a title at the top of every slide, which names the topic being\ndiscussed\n<li>\nDon't be afraid to use clip art and cartoons where appropriate, but\ndon't over do it here.\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n<h2>External Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a\nhref=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk-html.html\">\nHow to give a good research talk</a>\nand\n<a\nhref=\"http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/giving-a-talk/giving-a-talk-slides.pdf\">the\nslides that went with the lecture</a>\n<li> \n<a href=\"http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~silvia/research-tips/\">\nHow to Do Research</a>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/presentation.html\">\nSome tips for preparing a research presentation</a>\n</ul>\n\n<P>\n<hr>\n<b> \n<a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/\">\nMichael T.
