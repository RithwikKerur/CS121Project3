We show\nthat, for a discretization of the problem to an nxn grid\nof pixels with k centers, the problem can be solved in time\nO(n^2 log^5 n), and we experiment with two slower but more\npractical algorithms and a hybrid method that switches\nfrom one of these algorithms to the other to gain greater efficiency\nthan either algorithm alone. We also show how to combine geometric stable\nmatchings with a k-means clustering algorithm, so as to \nprovide a geometric political-districting algorithm that \nviews distance in economic terms, and we experiment\nwith weighted versions of stable k-means in order to improve the\nconnectivity of the resulting clusters.\n</p>\n<p>\nJoint work with David Eppstein and Michael Goodrich.\n</p>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
