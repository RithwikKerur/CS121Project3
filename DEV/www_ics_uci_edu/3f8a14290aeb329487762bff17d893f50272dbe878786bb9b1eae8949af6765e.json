Submissions focusing on both theoretical (fundamental) and applied real-world deployments are solicited. </p>\n<p>The goal of the conference is to bring security/cryptography researchers and practitioners together with economists, bankers, implementers, and policy-makers. Intimate and colorful by tradition, the FC program features invited talks, academic presentations, technical demonstrations, panel discussions as well as a research poster session. </p>\n<p>Tsudik's research interests are in computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent work focuses on privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile ad hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage systems. His research also covers secure group communication, in particular, group key agreement, group signatures and group access control.</p>\n<hr size=\"0\"/>\n<p><strong><a name=\"nalini_chair\"></a>Venkatasubramanian General Chair of Middleware 2007 conference</strong></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\">\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"photo: nalini venkatasubramanian\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/nalini.jpg\"/></div>\n<p><strong>Nalini<br/>\n                  Venkatasubramanian</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>Computer science professor <strong>Nalini Venkatasubramanian</strong> recently led the ACM/IFIP/USENIX Middleware 2007 conference as General Chair.</p>\n<p>The broad scope of the conference is the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of distributed systems platforms and architectures for future computing environments.</p>\n<p>Venkatasubramanian's research focuses on enabling effective management and utilization of resources in the evolving global information infrastructue. </p>\n<p>In the coming years, multimedia to the desktop and home is likely to become a pervasive technology. </p>\n<p>The composition of multiple resource management services is necessary to guarantee safe, cost-effective Quality-of-Service (QoS) to global multimedia applications.

year's study, Information Science/Studies at the UC Irvine's Bren School ranks fourth. </p>\n<p><strong>About Networked Systems<br/>\n\t\t        </strong>The Networked Systems program at the Bren School provides education and research opportunities to graduate students in the areas of computer networks and telecommunication networks.</p>\n<p>Networked Systems include telephone networks, cable TV networks, cellular phone networks, and the Internet, as well as other emerging networks.</p>\n<p>Networked Systems are inherently interdisciplinary. By their design, they connect devices such as computer and phones using communications methods. Networked Systems therefore must address the combination of software, hardware, and communications.</p>\n<p>As a result, the Networked Systems area spans traditional departmental boundaries. At a minimum, the area draws heavily from Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.</p>\n<p>At UCI, these areas are housed in two departments, ICS and EECS. The Networked Systems program unites the strengths of these two departments and provides more integrated M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in this area.</p>\n<p><strong>About Informatics (Information Science)</strong><br/>\n\t\t        Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use, and impact of information technology. It goes beyond technical design to focus on the relationship between information system design and use in real-world settings.</p>\n<p>These investigations lead to new forms of system architecture, new approaches to system design and development, new means of information system implementation and deployment, and new models of interaction between technology and social, cultural, and organizational settings.</p>\n<p>In the Bren School, Informatics is concerned with software architecture, software development, design and analysis, programming languages, ubiquitous computing, information retrieval and management, human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and other topics that lie at the relationship between information technology design and use in social and organizational settings</p>\n<p>Academic Analytics bases their ranking of doctoral programs on publications, citations of journal publications, federal research funding, and awards and honors.</p>\n<p>For more information please view the <a href=\"http://www.academicanalytics.com/TopPhysMathSci2006-07.html\">Academic Analytics web site</a>.   </p>\n<hr size=\"0\"/>\n<p><strong><a name=\"kay_moot\"></a>Kay serves as Moot Court Judge</strong></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"> <img alt=\"photo: david g. kay\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/kay.jpg\"/>\n<p><strong>David G. <br/>\n                      Kay</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>On November 16 and 17, 2007, Senior Lecturer <strong>David G.
