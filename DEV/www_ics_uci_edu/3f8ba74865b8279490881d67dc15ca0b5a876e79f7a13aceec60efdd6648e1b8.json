After observing that, in this cardinal\nsetting, stable fractional matchings can have much higher social welfare than stable integral ones, our goal\nis to understand the computational complexity of finding an optimal (i.e., welfare-maximizing) or nearly optimal\nstable fractional matching. We present simple approximation algorithms for this problem with weak\nwelfare guarantees and, rather unexpectedly, we furthermore show that achieving better approximations is\nhard. This computational hardness persists even for approximate stability. To the best of our knowledge, these\nare the first computational complexity results for stable fractional matchings. En route to these results, we\nprovide a number of structural observations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBased on a paper by Ioannis Caragiannis, Aris Filos-Ratsikas, Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Rohit Vaish <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06698.pdf\"> https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06698.pdf</a>\n</p>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
