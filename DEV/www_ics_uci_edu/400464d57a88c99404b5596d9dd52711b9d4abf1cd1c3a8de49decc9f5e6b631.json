The WWW project, started by <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/\">CERN</A> (the European Laboratory for\nParticle Physics), seeks to build a distributed hypermedia system.<P>\n<P>\nThe advantage of hypertext is that in a hypertext document, if you\nwant more information about a particular subject mentioned,\nyou can usually \"just click on it\" to read further detail. In fact,\ndocuments can be and often are linked to other documents by completely\ndifferent authors -- much like footnoting, but you can get the\nreferenced document instantly!\n<P>\nTo access the web, you run a <A\nHREF=\"#introuser\">browser\nprogram</A>.  The browser reads documents, and can fetch documents\nfrom other sources.  Information providers set up <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html\">hypermedia\nservers</A> which browsers can get documents from.<P>\n\nThe browsers can, in addition, access files by <A\nHREF=\"http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu:80/ftp-interface.html\">FTP</A>, <A\nHREF=\"news:*\">NNTP (the Internet news protocol)</A>, <A\nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.micro.umn.edu:70/11/Information%20About%20Gopher\">gopher</A>\nand <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/ByAccess.html\">an\never-increasing range of other methods</A>.  On top of these, if the\nserver has search capabilities, the browsers will permit <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/Products/WAIS/Overview.html\">searches\nof documents and databases</A>.<P>\n\nThe documents that the browsers display are hypertext documents.\nHypertext is text with pointers to other text.  The browsers let you\ndeal with the pointers in a transparent way -- select the pointer, and\nyou are presented with the text that is pointed to. <P>\n\nHypermedia is a superset of hypertext -- it is any medium with\npointers to other media.  This means that browsers might not display a\ntext file, but might display images or sound or animations.  <P>\n<A HREF=\"#contents\"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>\n\n<H2><A NAME=\"url\">3.2: What is a URL?</A></H2>\n\nURL stands for \"Uniform Resource Locator\".  It is a draft standard for\n<A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Addressing/Addressing.html\">specifying\nan object on the Internet</A>, such as a file or newsgroup.  <P>\n\nURLs look like this: (file: and ftp: URLs are synonymous.) \n<UL>\n<LI> file://wuarchive.wustl.edu/mirrors/msdos/graphics/gifkit.zip\n<LI> ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/mirrors\n<LI> http://info.cern.ch:80/default.html \n<LI> news:alt.hypertext\n<LI> telnet://dra.com\n</UL><P>\n\nThe first part of the URL, before the colon, specifies the access\nmethod.  The part of the URL after the colon is interpreted specific\nto the access method.  In general, two slashes after the colon\nindicate a machine name (machine:port is also valid).  \n<P>\nWhen you are told to \"check out this URL\", what to do next\ndepends on your browser; please check the help for your\nparticular browser. For the line-mode browser at CERN,\nwhich you will quite possibly use first via telnet,\nthe command to try a URL is \"GO URL\" (substitute the\nactual URL of course). In Lynx you just select the\n\"GO\" link on the first page you see; in graphical\nbrowsers, there's usually an \"Open URL\" option in the menus.\n<P>\n<A HREF=\"#contents\"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>\n<H2><A NAME=\"sgmlhtml\">3.3: What are SGML and HTML?</A></H2>\nDocuments on the World Wide Web are written in a simple\n\"markup language\" called HTML, which stands for\nHypertext Markup Language. See <A HREF=\"#prodhtml\">\nsection 5.3</A> for more information about creating\nHTML documents for use on the web.\n<P>\nSGML is a much broader language which is used to define\nparticular markup languages for particular purposes.\nHTML is just a specific application of SGML.\nYou can learn more about SGML, and the rationale behind\nHTML, by reading A Gentle Introduction to SGML (URL is\n<A HREF=\"http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV1%26id=SG\">\n http://etext.virginia.edu/bin/tei-tocs?div=DIV1%26id=SG </A>),\na document provided by the Text Encoding Initiative. \n(<em>Note:</em> Some browsers apparently crash on this URL.\nThere's nothing wrong with the document; try another browser\nif you have problems.)\n<P>\n<A HREF=\"#contents\"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>\n<H2><A NAME=\"compare\">3.4: How does WWW compare to gopher and WAIS?</A></H2>\n\nWhile all three of these information presentation systems are\nclient-server based, they differ in terms of their model of data.  In\ngopher, data is either a menu, a document, an index or a telnet\nconnection.  In WAIS, everything is an index and everything that is\nreturned from the index is a document.  In WWW, everything is a\n(possibly) hypertext document which may be searchable.<P>\n\nIn practice, this means that WWW can represent the gopher (a menu is a\nlist of links, a gopher document is a hypertext document without\nlinks, searches are the same, telnet sessions are the same) and WAIS\n(a WAIS index is a searchable page, returning a document with no\nlinks) data models as well as providing extra functionality.<P>\n\nWorld Wide Web usage grew far beyond Gopher usage in the\nlast few months, according to the statistics-keepers of the Internet backbone.\n(Of course, World Wide Web browsers can also access Gopher\nservers, which inflates the numbers for the latter.)\nWWW has long since reached critical mass, with new\ncommercial and noncommercial sites appearing daily.<P>\n<A HREF=\"#contents\"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>\n<H2><A NAME=\"books\">3.5: Are there books about the web?</A></H2>\n<P>\nYes, quite a few.

Note that \"your machine\" can be\ndefined as a system you dial into from home, such as netcom or\nanother account provider.

Be warned in\nadvance that the results may be poor.\n<P>\nTo get Mosaic to produce sound out of the PC speaker, first, you\nneed a driver for the speaker.  You can <A HREF=\"ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/SPEAK.EXE\">get the Microsoft speaker driver</A>\nfrom the URL ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/SPEAK.EXE\nor by doing an Archie search to find it somewhere else. \nSPEAK.EXE is a self-extracting file.  Copy the speak.exe file to\na new directory, and then type \"SPEAK\" at the DOS prompt.  Do not\nput the file SPEAKER.DRV in a separate directory from OEMSETUP.INF.\n<P>\nNow, you need to install the driver.  In Windows, from the\nProgram Manager choose successively Main/Control\nPanel/Drivers/Add/Unlisted or updated drivers/(enter path of\nSPEAK.EXE)/PC Speaker.  At this point some strange sounds\ncome out as the driver is initialized.  Change the settings to\nimprove the sound quality on the various sounds: tada, chimes,\netc.  Click OK when you are finished and choose the Restart\nwindows option.\n<P>\nHaving installed the speaker driver, you will now get sounds\nwhenever you start Windows, make a mistake, or exit Windows.  If\nyou do not want this, from the Main/Control\nPanel/Sounds menu, make sure there is no X next to \"Enable System\nSounds.\"\n<P>\nNow, you need a sound viewer program that Mosaic can call to\ndisplay sounds.  NCSA unfortunately recommend WHAM, which does\nnot work well with a PC speaker.  Get the program WPLANY instead.\nYou can find a copy nearby with an Archie search on the string\n\"wplny\"; the current version is WPLNY09B.ZIP. For details on\narchie and other basic issues related to FTP, please read\nthe Usenet newsgroup <A HREF=\"news:news.announce.newusers\">\nnews.announce.newusers</A>.\n<P>\nMove the zip file to a new directory, and use an unzip program\nlike pkunzip to unzip it, producing the files WPLANY.EXE and\nWPLANY.DOC.  Then edit the MOSAIC.INI file to remove the \"REM\"\nbefore the line \"TYPE9=audio/basic\".  Then, you need lines in the\nsection below that read something like:\naudio/basic=\"c:\\wplany\\wplany.exe %ls\"\naudio/wav=\"c:\\wplany\\wplany.exe %ls\"\nwhere you have filled in the correct path for wplany.exe.  The\nMOSAIC.INI file delivered with Mosaic may have NOTEPAD.EXE on the\naudio/basic line, but this will not work.  Now, restart Mosaic,\nand you should now be able to produce sounds.  To check this,\nwith Mosaic choose File/Local File/\\WINDOWS\\*.WAV and then try\nto play TADA.WAV.  Then, you might try the Mosaic Demo document\nfor some .AU sounds, but you are lucky if your speaker produces\nsomething you can understand.\n<P>\n<A HREF=\"#contents\"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>\n<H2><A NAME=\"nowais\">4.8: I have a Windows PC or Macintosh. Why can't\nI access WAIS URLs?</A></H2>\n<P>\nThis answer provided by Michael Grady (m-grady@uiuc.edu):\n<P>\n   The version of Mosaic for X has \"wais client\" code built-in to it. This\n   was relatively easy for the developers to do, because there was already\n   a set of library routines for talking to WAIS available for Unix as\n   \"public domain\" (freeWAIS). I don't think there is such a library of\n   routines for PC/Windows or Mac, which would make it much more difficult\n   for the Mosaic versions for Windows and the Mac to add \"wais client\"\n   capability. Therefore, at least for now, neither the Windows or Mac\n   versions of Mosaic support direct query of a WAIS server (i.e. can act\n   as wais clients themselves).\n<P>\n<A HREF=\"#contents\"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>\n<H2><A NAME=\"noviewers\">\n4.9: I'm running XMosaic. Why can't I get external viewers working...</A></H2>\n... No matter what no matter what I do to my\n.mailcap and .mime.types files?\n<P>\nAnswer provided by Ronald E. Daniel (rdaniel@acl.lanl.gov):\n<blockquote>\n<P>\nMosaic only looks at the .mime.types file if it has no idea what the\ndocument's type is. This is actually a very rare situation. Essentially\nall servers now use the HTTP/1.0 protocol, which means that they tell\nMosaic (or other browsers) what the document's MIME Content-type is. The\nservers use a file very much like Mosaic's .mime.types file to infer the\nContent-type from the filename's extension.\n<P>\nIt is pretty simple to find out if this really is the problem. Use telnet to\ntalk to the server and find out if it is assigning a MIME type to the\ndocument in question. Here's an example, looking at the home page for my\nserver. (idaknow: is my shell prompt)\n<pre>\n  idaknow: telnet www.acl.lanl.gov 80  // Connect to the httpd server\n  Trying 128.165.148.3 ...\n  Connected to www.acl.lanl.gov.\n  Escape character is '^]'.\n  HEAD /Home.html  HTTP/1.0             // replace Home.html  with your document\n                                       // you supply the blank line\n  HTTP/1.0 200 OK                      // the rest of this comes from the server  Date: Wednesday, 25-May-94 19:18:11 GMT\n  Server: NCSA/1.1\n  MIME-version: 1.0\n  Content-type: text/html              // Here's the MIME Content-type\n  Last-modified: Monday, 16-May-94 16:21:58 GMT\n  Content-length: 1727\n\n  Connection closed by foreign host.\n  idaknow: \n</pre>\nIn the example above, /Home.html  will get http://www.acl.lanl.gov/Home.html .\n<P>\n\nNormally servers will be configured to supply a Content-type of text/plain\nif they don't know what else to do. If this is the problem you are having,\ntake a look at the \n<A HREF=\"http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/setup/httpd/TypesConfig.html\"> \nTypesConfig documentation</A> for\n<A HREF=\"http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs/Overview.html\"> \nNCSA's httpd</A>.\nYou can have the server look at the filename extension, supply the\ncorrect Content-type, then use your local .mailcap file to tell Mosaic\nwhat viewer to use to look at the document.\n</blockquote>\nRuss Segal adds:\n<blockquote>\nThe answer from Ronald Daniel is essentially correct, but it needs a\nsmall addendum.\n<P>\nWhen starting Moasic, you can specify a \"fileProxy\" which will fetch\nfiles for you:\n<P>\n    <code>\"*fileProxy: http://socks/\"</code>\n<P>\nIf you do this, file: URLs are no longer strictly local accesses.  So\neven if the URL is not fttp:, the proxy server must be upgraded as Mr.\nDaniel suggests.\n</blockquote>       \n<P>\n<A HREF=\"#contents\"><em>(Up to Table of Contents)</em></A>\n<H2><A NAME=\"robots\">\n4.10: Hey, I know, I'll write a WWW-exploring robot!

Here are some rules of thumb to\nuse when deciding what kind of connection you need for your server.\n<P>\nThe first rule of thumb is:\n<P>\n<strong>Don't worry about simultaneous access.</strong>\n<P>\nUnless you have a very large site, simultaneous access is not a\nproblem. If you have a very large site, you need as much bandwidth as\nyou can afford. There is a bit more about this below.\n<P>\nThe second rule of thumb is:\n<P>\n<strong>It should take at most 5 seconds to send a page.</strong>\n<P>\nThe five second rule dates from command line days, when that was about\nhow long people would wait before getting impatient with the system.\nIt seems like a reasonable number to use now.\n<P>\nSince external images/audio/etc. are somewhat exceptional, allow more\ntime for them. If you think they should have the same restrictions as\nabove, buy the bandwidth your site will need to do so. However, the\nrule of thumb for external images/audio/etc is:\n<P>\n<strong>It should take at most 30 seconds to send an external file.</strong>\n<P>\nGiven these rules, it's pretty straightforward to work out how large\nan HTML page and external files can be. At least, it's easy after you\nsimplify things by ignoring IP overhead on the line, compression on\nmodem lines, and anything that's less than 10% of the total (or even a\nlittle bit more than 10%).\n<P>\nThe one simplification not to ignore is the multiple packet\nround-trips it takes to get data flowing through an HTTP channel. For\nmodem lines, this is nearly a second for each HTTP connection, which\nis significant. For leased lines, it's more like .1 or .2 seconds,\nwhich is not significant.\n<P>\nOn a 14.4 line assumed to be sending 1.4K bytes of data/second, with a\n1 second startup, you get 4 * 1.4 or 5.6K of HTML. If you want to\ninclude a single inline image, that's 2 seconds of startup, so you're\ndown to 3 * 1.4 or 4.2K of HTML + image. This means smallish HTML\npages, and simple inline images. For external files, you get 29 * 1.4\nor 40K, which is still a small image. If you have a 28.8 line, you get\nto double those figures; for a 9600 line, figure 2/3rds of that size.\n<P>\nOn a 56K leased line assumed to be sending 5K/second, you get 25K of\nHTML, or mixed HTML/data. For external images, it's 150K. That should\ncover any reasonable HTML document, and small to medium external\nfiles. An MPEG movie might be a bit much.\n<P>\nWith a T1 line assumed to be sending 150K/second, you get 750K of\nHTML, or 4.5 megabytes in an external file. Barring very large\nanimations, this should be sufficient for anything you want to serve.\nMore would be faster, but it also gets drastically more expensive.\n<P>\nGiven the above guidelines, let's look at simultaneous access again.\nUnder the worst case conditions, you're using all of your line for\nHTML pages, each of which takes 5 seconds to send, so your server is\nsending 12 pages a minute, or 720 pages an hour, or 17,000 pages a day\n(pages, not accesses; each inline image in a page generates an access,\nunless the client cached it). This makes you one of the busier sites\non the web. While you'll have contention problems before you get to\nthis point, anything but a modem connection will be sending most pages\nin a small fraction of five seconds, which should leave plenty of\nbandwidth with no contention.
