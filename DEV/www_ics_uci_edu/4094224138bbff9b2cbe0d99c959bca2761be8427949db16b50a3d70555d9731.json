Sometimes, it's as simple as just storing text, but if you want to do anything with the data other than display it exactly as it's stored, there's a good chance you'll need to consider a way to organize it within the file.  For common problems like storing images or videos, there are existing file formats, such as the JPEG format for image files, but you can define your own, too, if a pre-existing format isn't appropriate for your particular use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you write programs that communicate with one another using sockets, you have a similar problem.  The program on each side of the connection will be sending data to the other.  Without an agreement about what that data will look like, the data sent from one program won't make sense to the other one.  So, when programs communicate via sockets, you will always need them to agree on a <i>protocol</i>, which specifies what each program will send and what it will expect to receive.  As with file formats, there are well-known protocols already defined for specific purposes &mdash; like the HTTP protocol that describes how data is transferred over the web, or the SMTP protocol that is used to send email &mdash; but you can also define your own protocol if you need something specific for your particular use.  What's important is that both programs implement the same protocol, and that each program knows its role in that protocol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The Polling protocol</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In lecture, we wrote a client program that interacted with a <i>Polling server</i>, a program that I built that allows users to answer multiple-choice questions, while tracking the number of times a user picked each choice.  The server is the program that keeps track, as time goes on, of what the questions are and who's answered them how; other programs can interact with it by connecting to it via a socket and then sending and receiving text in a predefined format called the <i>Polling protocol</i>.  The Polling protocol, like other protocols, governs what each program &mdash; a Polling client and the Polling server &mdash; is required to send and what it can expect to receive in return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Polling protocol is what is sometimes known as a <i>request-reply protocol</i>.  Lines of text are sent back and forth between the client and server, with each interaction being driven by the client sending a <i>request</i> and the server sending a corresponding <i>reply</i>.  Every line is terminated with a <i>newline sequence</i>, which is made up of the Python string <b>'\\r\\n'</b> &mdash; technically, these characters are known as a <i>carriage return</i> and a <i>line feed</i> &mdash; without which the receiving program won't know that the sender has sent a complete line of text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the Polling protocol, the interactions between a Polling client and the Polling server are expected to work as described below.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>The client connects to the Polling server</i>\r\n  <li>The Polling server accepts the connection</li>\r\n  <li>The client sends a line consisting only of the word <b>POLLING_HELLO</b>, followed by a space, followed by a UCInetID (i.e., a UCI email address without the @uci.edu).  So, for example, for someone whose UCI email was <b>boo@uci.edu</b>, the client would send <b>POLLING_HELLO boo</b>.</li>\r\n  <li>The server checks the UCInetID against a list of the ones that it will accept &mdash; everyone in this course should be on the list, among others.  If the server accepts the UCInetID, it responds with <b>HELLO</b>; otherwise, it responds with <b>NO_USER</b>, followed by a space, followed by the UCInetID.\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>The purpose of this initial interaction is to establish that the client implements the Polling protocol and not some other one; it's quite common for protocols to begin with some kind of \"hello\" or \"handshake\" sequence like this, to quickly and easily weed out scenarios where a client program doesn't know the protocol expected by a server, such as what might happen if you tried to connect your web browser to the Polling server instead.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>Once the server has accepted the UCInetID, the client is considered \"logged in.\"  There is no password or other authentication required.  From that point, the client can send one of five commands, each of which would result in a different kind of repsonse:\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>The line <b>POLLING_QUESTIONS</b>, in which case the server will respond two things:\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>The line <b>QUESTION_COUNT <i>number_of_questions</i></b>, where <i>number_of_questions</i> is a non-negative integer such as <b>10</b>.  This specifies how many questions the server has available to vote on.</li>\r\n          <li>If <i>number_of_questions</i> is the number <i>n</i>, this will be followed by <i>n</i> lines, each of which is <b>QUESTION</b>, followed by a space, followed by a <i>question ID</i>, followed by a space, followed by the text of the question.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>The line <b>POLLING_CHOICES <i>question_id</i></b>, where <i>question_id</i> is expected to be one of the question numbers of an existing question that the server has available to vote on.  If it's not, the server will respond with <b>NO_QUESTION</b>, followed by a space, followed by the question number sent to it.  If it is a valid question number, the server will respond with two things:\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>The line <b>CHOICE_COUNT <i>number_of_choices</i></b>, where <i>number_of_choices</i> is a non-negative integer such as <b>10</b>.  This specifies how many choices the chosen question has available.</li>\r\n          <li>If <i>number_of_choices</i> is the number <i>n</i>, this will be followed by <i>n</i> lines, each of which is <b>CHOICE</b>, followed by a space, followed by a <i>choice ID</i>, followed by a space, followed by the text of the choice.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>The line <b>POLLING_VOTE <i>question_id</i> <i>choice_id</i></b>, where <i>question_id</i> is expected to be one of the existing question IDs and <i>choice_id</i> is expected to be one of the existing choice IDs for that question.  There are a few possible responses you might get, depending on the circumstance, but you'll only get one of them.\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li><b>VOTED</b>, if the vote was accepted.</li>\r\n          <li><b>ALREADY_VOTED</b>, if the user already voted on this question.</li>\r\n          <li><b>NO_QUESTION <i>question_id</i></b>, if the question did not exist.</li>\r\n          <li><b>NO_CHOICE <i>choice_id</i></b>, if the choice did not exist for the specified question.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>The line <b>POLLING_RESULTS <i>question_id</i></b>, where <i>question_id</i> is expected to be one of the question IDs of an existing question that the server has available to vote on.  If it's not, the server will respond with <b>NO_QUESTION</b>, followed by a space, followed by the question ID sent to it.  If it is a valid question ID, the server will respond with two things:\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>The line <b>RESULT_COUNT <i>number_of_choices</i></b>, where <i>number_of_choices</i> is a non-negative integer such as <b>10</b>.  This specifies how many choices the chosen question has available.</li>\r\n          <li>If <i>number_of_choices</i> is the number <i>n</i>, this will be followed by <i>n</i> lines, each of which is <b>RESULT</b>, followed by a space, followed by a <i>choice ID</i>, followed by a space, followed by the number of votes for that choice so far, followed by a space, followed by the text of the choice.</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </li>\r\n      <li>The line <b>POLLING_GOODBYE</b>, in which case the server will respond with <b>GOODBYE</b> and then close the connection; the interaction between the client and the server is now over.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>An example session follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<table class=\"normal\">\r\n  <tr class=\"top\">\r\n    <td>Client</td>\r\n    <td>Server</td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><i>initiates a connection</i></td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><i>accepts the connection</i></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>POLLING_HELLO boo</b></td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><b>HELLO</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>POLLING_QUESTIONS</td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><b>QUESTION_COUNT 1</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><b>QUESTION 1 Who is your favorite Pekingese?</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>POLLING_CHOICES 1</td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><b>CHOICE_COUNT 1</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><b>CHOICE 1 Boo</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>POLLING_VOTE 1 1</b></td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><b>VOTED</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>POLLING_VOTE 1 1</b></td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><b>ALREADY_VOTED</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><b>POLLING_GOODBYE</b></td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><b>GOODBYE</b></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n    <td><i>closes the connection</i></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n  <tr>\r\n    <td><i>closes the connection</i></td>\r\n    <td></td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">What we wanted to build</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protocol described above is not intended for human use, any more than the HTTP protocol &mdash; which governs how web browsers download web pages and other data &mdash; is intended for people.  A web browser has the knowledge of the HTTP protocol embedded within it; behind the scenes, when you visit a web page, a conversation between your web browser and a <i>web server</i> commences, with HTTP defining what that conversation will look like.  But the conversation itself is invisible to users of a web browser; someone using a browser simply sees some kind of progress indication and, ultimately, the web page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, we might like to build a Polling client, whose job is to provide a user with the ability to use the Polling service without having to know the details of hosts, ports, sockets, and protocols, so they can simply look at a list of questions and vote on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Taking the opportunity to think about design</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As programs get larger, we're best off separating them into modules that contain related subsets of functionality.  When writing this program, we quickly find that there's a natural separation between the part of the program that implements the protocol (i.e., the part that communicates with the Polling server) and the program's user interface.  Isolating each of these into its own module makes each of those modules simpler, and also provides other benefits (e.g., keeping a larger, complex program organized; allowing us to put more than one \"outer shell\" around the protocol code if, for example, we wanted to also write a graphical user interface).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So this program is probably best written with two modules, which we'll call <b>polling</b> (the protocol implementation) and <b>polling_ui</b> (the user interface).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, the functions in each module are broken into progressively smaller functions, with meaningful names and well-named parameters.  This code example, in my view, is a good example of why we should want to do that, because there's a fair amount of complexity here that's worth isolating, so we can think about one thing at a time instead of everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, within each module, we were fastidious about separating the public functions (i.e., the ones we expect would be needed by code in other modules) from the private ones (i.e., the ones that are only useful within that module).  This separation provides at least two benefits: Making it easier to understand how to use a module, by limiting how many functions a user of that module needs to know about; and leaving open the possibility that certain aspects of how a module is implemented might change without affecting the code that calls it.  As long as other modules use only the public parts of our module, we can feel free to change the private ones without having a negative effect on the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">A word of warning</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should be noted that this isn't code that you're going to be able to copy and paste, in whole, into your <a href=\"../../ProjectGuide/Project2\">Project #2</a> solution, as the protocol you're implementing in the project (and your program's interaction with it) is different from this one in some important ways.  But there are ideas and techniques here that translate to your work on the project; the trick is being sure that you understand what's being done in this example and <i>why</i> before you attempt to use these ideas in your own programs, because part of what's important is understanding what parts of this example fit the problem you're solving in the project and which don't.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">The code</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below are links to a complete Polling client, along with a module that implements the Polling protocol.  Because we tend to write these examples in lecture in a free-form way, there may be a few minor differences between what's here and what we wrote in lecture, but the code is not meaningfully different from what we wrote.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li><a href=\"polling.py\"><b>polling.py</b> &mdash; an implementation of the Polling protocol</a></li>\r\n  <li><a href=\"polling_ui.py\"><b>polling_ui.py</b> &mdash; a console user interface for Polling</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember to download these files and place them in the same directory.  It's important that they're in the same directory, so that Python will be able to find them when one imports the other.  (There are fancier things that we can do, but we generally keep all of the modules that comprise our programs in a single directory until they get much, much larger.)</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Trying out the example client</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Polling server like the one we connected to during lecture is now running on the same machine where the Connect Four server for <a href=\"../../ProjectGuide/Project2\">Project #2</a> is running.  (See a previously-sent email for an indication of where that is.)  The Polling server is listening on port 5501.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that you'll need to make one update to the code &mdash; setting the value of the <b>POLLING_HOST</b> constant defined in <b>polling_ui.py</b> &mdash; before you can successfully run it.  As you experiment with it, you might also want to set the <b>_SHOW_DEBUG_TRACE</b> constant defined in <b>polling.py</b> to <b>True</b>, which will display every line of text sent to the server and received in response.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
