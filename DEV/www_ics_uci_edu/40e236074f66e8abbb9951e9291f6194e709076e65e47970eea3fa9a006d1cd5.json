I've listed them on\na <A HREF=\"games.html\">separate web page</A>.\n\n<H2>Project tasks</H2>\n\nYour proposal should <A HREF=\"components.html\">list the software\ncomponents</A> that will be included in your project,\nand determine which team members are responsible for\nwhich components.\n\n<H2>Search complexity</H2>\n\nYour proposal should say how many different legal moves are available\nat a typical position in your game (this number is known as the\n<I>branching factor</I>).  If there are b legal moves, and you perform\nminimax search to a depth of k moves, you should search roughly\nb<sup>k</sup> positions.  Assuming you can search 100,000 positions/second\n(a pretty typical number), how large can k be if you want your search to\nfinish in one second?\n\n<P>(Note, the actual search depth will likely be better than this estimate.\nAlpha-beta pruning will roughly double the depth you can reach, but other\npruning techniques are available and\nmay turn out to be necessary depending on the branching factor of your game.)\n\n<H2>Evaluation terms</H2>\n\nYour proposal should make a preliminary guess at\nwhat sort of information needs to be included in the\n<A HREF=\"components.html\">evaluation function</A>,\nand describe how you will go about computing that information.\nProbably this will not end up describing how your final product\nworks, but you need to start with something here.\n\n<H2>Platforms</H2>\n\nYour proposal should state what kind of machine you use and what\nlanguage you will program in.\nMy preference would be Java (due to its portability and ease of setting\nup user interfaces) but you may use other languages \nsuch as C, C++, etc. \nIf you use a Mac, Linux-based PC, Windows '98, or other platform not generally\navailable in the ICS labs, you should make sure that\na portable machine will be available for project demonstrations.\n\n<P>If you wish to have your code preserved on a web site,\nI will make room available for this on the course web page.\nThis may give you another reason for choosing Java over other languages.\n\n<H2>Using other people's code</H2>\n\nYou may use user interface code written by people other than project\nmembers, as long as the code is available for such use and you give full\ncredit for it in your project documentation.\nAll components of the game engine itself, including the board\nrepresentation, search code, move generation, and position evaluation,\nshould be written yourselves.\n\n<HR>\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein,\n<A HREF=\"/\">Dept.
