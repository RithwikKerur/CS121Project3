Young\n<p>\nCan one choose a good Huffman code on the fly, without knowing the\nunderlying distribution?\nOnline Slot Allocation (OSA) models this and similar problems: There\nare n slots, each with a known\ncost. There are n items. Requests for items are drawn i.i.d. from a\nfixed but hidden probability\ndistribution p. After each request, if the item, i, was not\npreviously requested, then the algorithm\n(knowing c and the requests so far, but not p) must place the item in\nsome vacant slot j_i , at cost\np_i c(j_i). The goal is to minimize the total cost sum_i=(1 to n) p_i\nc(j_i).\n\n<p>\nThe optimal offline algorithm is trivial: put the most probable item\nin the cheapest slot, the\nsecond most probable item in the second cheapest slot, etc. The\noptimal online algorithm is First\nCome First Served (fcfs): put the first requested item in the\ncheapest slot, the second (distinct)\nrequested item in the second cheapest slot, etc. The optimal\ncompetitive ratios for any online\nalgorithm are 1 + H_{n \u2212 1} \u223c ln n for general costs and 2 for\nconcave costs. For logarithmic costs, the\nratio is, asymptotically, 1: fcfs gives cost opt + O(log opt).\n<p>\nFor Huffman coding, fcfs yields an online algorithm (one that\nallocates codewords on demand,\nwithout knowing the underlying probability distribution) that\nguarantees asymptotically optimal\ncost: at most opt + 2 log2 (1 + opt) + 2.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
