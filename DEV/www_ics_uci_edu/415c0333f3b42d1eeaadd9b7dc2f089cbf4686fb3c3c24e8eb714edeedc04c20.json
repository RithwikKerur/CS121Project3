Its decade-old origins are not clear (to me),\nbut at the least Ron Graham has discussed it in public lectures.\nThe consensus seems to be that the only bounds known are something\nlike n^{-2^k}, or perhaps (n*k)^{-2^k}, or perhaps (4*n*k)^{-4^k},\nbut in any case n^{-p} with p exponential in k.  On the other hand,\nOdlyzko feels that the true bound is more like n^{-k}, or perhaps\nn^{-2*k}: n^{-p} with p linear in k.  The gap between what can be\nproved and what seems to be true, is rather wide, but closing\nit seems difficult.\n\t\t\t\t--Joseph O'Rourke, Smith College\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:jmchen@pub.jiangmen.gd.cn\">jmchen@pub.jiangmen.gd.cn</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Welcome to my site on Equal sums of like powers\n<B>Date:</B>           Mon, 28 Jul 1997 15:10:21 -0700\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nThanks for the pointer to your page on equal sums of like powers,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/chenhome.htm\">http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/chenhome.htm</A>\n\nYou know, by the way, of the following application of such sums?\n\nIt is an important open problem in computational geometry how much\nprecision is needed to compute lengths of polygonal paths, in order to\ndetermine which of two paths is longer.  If the path vertices have\ninteger coordinates, each length is a sum of square roots of integers,\nso the problem can be expressed in number-theoretic terms: how small can\nbe a nonzero number that is the sum of k terms +-sqrt(a_i) where each\na_i is an integer smaller than some bound N.\n\nThe known lower bounds are something like N^{-2^k}, but the best known\nupper bound (i.e. explicit construction) is much larger, something like\nN^{-k}.  This upper bound is based on sums like the ones you treat.\n(I think this may be due to Ron Graham but unfortunately I can't find\nthe reference offhand -- Marshall Bern showed it to me and Graham\nmay have showed it to him.)  Here's how it works:\n\nSuppose we have two sets of numbers a_i and b_i,\nsuch that sum(a_i^j - b_i^j)=0 for all j from 0 to k.\n(You have a page <A HREF=\"http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/TarryPrb.htm\">http://www.jiangmen.gd.cn/person/chen/TarryPrb.htm</A>\non this case.)  For instance, your home page has\na_i={1,19,20,51,57,80,82}, b_i={2,12,31,40,69,71,85}, k=6.\n\nThen, consider the number\n\tx = sum(sqrt(N - a_i) - sqrt(N - b_i)).\n\nEach of the summands sqrt(N - a_i) can be expressed as a Taylor series\nsqrt(N)*(1-y^2-y^2/8-y^3/16-5y^4/128-7y^5/256-...)\nwhere y=a_i/N.  The fact that all the sums of powers of ai and bi\nare equal means that the initial terms in these Taylor series cancel\nand x = O(sqrt(n) y^{k+1}) = O(N^{-k-1/2}).\n\nNumerically, with the a_i above and N=1000, we have x ~= 2.5 * 10^{-11}.\nWith N=10000 we have x ~= 6 * 10^{-18}, and in general multiplying N by\n10 is going to lead to a reduction by around 3*10^6 in x.  With more of\nthe sums of powers being equal, x would go down even more quickly as a\nfunction of N.  So, solutions to the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem lead\nto quite small sums of square roots.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
