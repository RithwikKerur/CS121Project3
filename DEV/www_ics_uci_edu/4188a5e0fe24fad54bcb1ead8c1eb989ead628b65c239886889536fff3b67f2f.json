The topic can be related to another course\nyou are taking, your major, or the content of this class.\nAn annotated guide to Web resources in an academic/scholarly area\nis one type of reasonable research paper.\n<P>\nHere's the overall time-line:\n<ul>\n<li>\n  21 &amp; 26 August: Consider what topic you want to choose and get at\n     least 5 distinct sites from which you can get suitable information.\n     Prepare a proposal consisting of 50 to 100 words describing the\n     scope of your paper and 5 of the references you will use.  Check\n     with Cahill and Leung if you have questions\n     about the appropriateness of a topic or want suggestions.\n<li>\n  26 August: In lab, submit your proposal using the Web form\n       <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vitus/ics1c/doc/hw4a.html\">\n       http://www.ics.uci.edu/~vitus/ics1c/doc/hw4a.html</A>\n     which will be available at that time.\n     <BR>Suggestion: Use a text editor to create\n     your proposal and then cut-and-paste into the form provided.\n<li>\n  27 - 29 August: Proposals on display so that the instructional staff\n     and members of the class \n     can offer comments and propose questions for you to address.\n<li>\n  9 September: Final project due by 5 p.m.\n</ul>\nTeam/joint papers are acceptable with 2 to 3 people collaborating.\nAll participants and their roles should be identified in the proposal.\n<p>\nGrading will be on the basis of content and presentation\n(including appropriate use of the technology).\nThe choice of topic is a critical part of this project.\n<p>\nThe characterization of it as \"academic/scholarly\" is deliberate.\nTecho-toy gee-whiz stuff is fun, but not what is expected here.\n<p>\nIn choosing your topic and writing the proposal (one could almost call\nit an abstract written before the paper), imagine that the audience\nwill be a faculty member, parent, or fellow student who is skeptical\nthat all this \"network computer stuff\" has substantive content beyond \nnumber-crunching, network-cruising, chat-line, game playing.\n<p>\n<HR>\n<i>This information brought to you by\n<A HREF=\"/\">www.ics.uci.edu</A><br> Current as of\n20 August 1996\n<br>\nPlease send comments to vitus@ics.uci.edu,\nincluding the URL to which your comments apply.\n</i>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
