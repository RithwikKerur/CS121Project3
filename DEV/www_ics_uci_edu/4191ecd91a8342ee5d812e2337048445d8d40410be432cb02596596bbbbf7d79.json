Increasingly, the world itself is an\ninterface to computation. How can we understand these phenomena,\nand design for them effectively?\n<dt><b>Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW)</b>\n<dd>Much of what we do, even when we're working \"alone\", is in fact\ncollaborative. We work as members of teams, groups, organizations, and\nsocieties, and we coordinate our activities with others with and\nthrough computation. What is the impact of technology on our\ninteractions and collaborations with each other?\n<dt><b>Social Studies of Science and Technology</b>\n<dd>The design, use, and impact of technologies is determined not\nsolely by technical factors but also by how those technologies are\nshaped by social pressures and demands. These social considerations\nalso shape what questions science asks and how we evaluate the answers.\n</dl>\n\n<p>\nBringing these together, much of my research considers the social\nanalysis of encounters between people, technology, and the everyday\nworld. Empirically, it draws primarily on ethnographic investigation\nof work practice (but also on lab studies, survey data, and other\nsources of information). Analytically, it draws on a range of largely\nphenomenological positions, especially ethnomethodology. Technically,\nit combines interests in databases, networks, software engineering,\nand user interfaces to create novel ways for people to encounter\ncomputation. A central concern is <i>understanding how the experience\nof interactive technology allows people to create and share new forms\nof practice</i>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWhen I say the experience of technology, I mean not just its\nusability, or other engineering-oriented metrics of effectiveness;\ninstead, I mean the ways in which people experience the technology as\nuseful or meaningful. Similarly, when I talk about practice, I mean\nways of acting with and through technology; not just how people use\ncomputers, but how they adapt and adopt them, incorporating them into\ntheir lives and their work.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRight now, I have two main projects.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe first is concerned with privacy and security. In this work, we\nthink of privacy not as something that people <i>have</i> but more as\nsomething that people <i>do</i>. What\nkinds of information practice do\npeople engage in, and what do they achieve through them?\nWe are interested in people's\ncollective ways of orienting towards information as private, public,\nsensitive, or secret, or ways of thinking of activities as being\nrisky, secure, dangerous, or appropriate, and the factors that both\nshape and are shaped by those forms of social meaning.\nThis work has empirical, technical, and conceptual elements; it is\nbeing carried out in collaboration with a range of people, including\nDavid Redmiles in Informatics, Simon Cole in Criminology, and Jenny\nTerry in Women's Studies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe second is concerned with spatiality. How do advanced information\ntechnologies -- cell phones, wireless and wired networks, augmented\nenvironments, etc. -- cause us to re-encounter the spaces through\nwhich we move? How do we understand space in the first place? Where do\nour notions of \"place\" and \"space\" come from, and what kinds of \nrelationship do they have to our patterns of movement and action in\neverday space? Although we take spatiality very much for granted, the\ngoal of this work is to think about it as a social and cultural product.\nWe have turned, for example, to studies of the aboriginal Australian\nencounter with the mythic landscape, the Native American experience of\nthe moral landscape, or the many different forms of urban spatiality\nas ways of provoking new imaginaries of space and technology.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor more detail, see my list of\n<a href=publications.shtml>publications</a> or check my\n<a href=students.shtml>students'</a> web pages, all of which\nare probably updated more often that this page.\n</p>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
