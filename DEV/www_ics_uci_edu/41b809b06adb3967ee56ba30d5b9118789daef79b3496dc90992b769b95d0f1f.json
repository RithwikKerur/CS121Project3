State-of-the-art software engineering\nand promising research areas covered, including principles of software\nengineering, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing,\nand project management.\n</blockquote>\n\n<P>\nThis class is a graduate survey of software engineering topics.  The\ninstructors assume background in software engineering, as well as some\nexperience in developing software systems.  For example, the course\nassumes knowledge of the basic ideas of:  software development phases\n(e.g., requirements engineering, design, implementation), software\ndevelopment processes (such as the spiral model and the waterfall\nmodel), software design methodologies (such as design based on\ninformation hiding), software testing and analysis strategies, and\nproject management issues (e.g. chief programmer teams).\nStudents new to this area are advised to take ICS 121, as this course\nwill not repeat basic material, but rather will be focused on issues at\nthe frontier of software engineering.  At the end of the class students\nshould be knowledgeable about what key problems are currently being\npursued by software researchers, what the key approaches are, and who are\nmany of the leading researchers.\n\n<P>\nThe vehicles for learning about the topics are readings from the textbook,\nreadings from the technical literature, lectures, and classroom discussion.\nThe class is co-taught by the software faculty in order for specialty topics\nto be presented in depth.\n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"readings\"></a>\n<H1> Readings </H1>\nRequired textbook:\n<ul>\n<li>  \n<A HREF=\"http://www.prenhall.com/013/820431/82043-1.html\">\n<em> Fundamentals of Software Engineering</em>, </A>\nby \n<A HREF=\"http://www.elet.polimi.it/people/ghezzi/index.html\">\nCarlo Ghezzi</a>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/Staff/mj/mehdi.html\">\nMehdi Jazayeri, </A>\nand <A HREF=\"http://www.elet.polimi.it/people/mandriol/index.html\">\nDino Mandrioli, </A>\n1991.

For each paper assigned during the class\n(expectation:  about 10-12) you are required to submit a two-page (appx.\n800 word) summary and evaluation.  One page should summarize the key points\nor contributions of the paper.  The second page should assess the applicability\nof the ideas, problems in applying the ideas, or provide other critical\nevaluation.  In aggregate these summaries will account for 40% of your\ngrade.\n<li>  Term paper.  Accounting for 30% of your grade, the term paper is\nan in-depth exploration of some current topic in software engineering.\n(The paper must be new for this class, not a warmed-over paper written for\nsome other ICS class.)  This paper may be largely survey in character.\nSubstantial latitude will be allowed in choosing the topic, but all topics\nmust be approved in advance by the instructor.\n<li>  Class attendance and participation is critical.  This will account\nfor 10% of your grade.\n<li>  Final exam.  A final exam, worth 20%, will allow you to demonstrate\nyour understanding of the papers and topics covered in class.\n</ul>\n\n\n<hr>\n<a name=\"students\"></a>\n<H1> Enrolled Students </H1>\n<P>\n<ul>\n<li> <em> your name goes here.... </em>\n</ul>\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS> \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\"> Department of Information and Computer \nScience</A>, \n<BR>University of California, Irvine CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
