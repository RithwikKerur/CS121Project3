Are any of\nthese possible?  I can also immerse a genus-four manifold with\ntetrahedral symmetry (imagine holes running from each vertex of a\ntetrahedron to the opposite face) and this also leads to immersions of\ngenus 7, 10, 13 but not 1, 2, or 5.\n<P><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:adler@pulsar.wku.edu\">adler@pulsar.wku.edu</A> (Allen Adler)\n<B>Date:</B>           15 May 1997 23:17:56 -0500\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Symmetries of torus-shaped polyhedra?\n</PRE><HR>\n<P>You might have more luck in higher dimensions. For example,\nthe torus S1 x S1 sits in complex 2-dimensional space and\nhas a two dimensional group of symmetries. You can also\nembed the torus in various ways in complex projective spaces\nof dimensions 2,3,4,... as the \"elliptic normal curve\"\nso as to be invariant under a group of order 2*n^2, n-1  being\nthe dimension of the projective space. You can probably easily\nget a triangulation invariant under that group.\n\n<P>Allan Adler<BR>\n<A HREF=\"mailto:adler@pulsar.cs.wku.edu\">adler@pulsar.cs.wku.edu</A>\n<P><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        Symmetries of torus-shaped polyhedra?\n<B>Date:</B>           Thu, 18 Sep 1997 12:25:34 -0700\n</PRE><HR>\n<P>As an addendum to my earlier message, tetrahedrally symmetric polyhedra\ncan also achieve genus 5: drill holes from the middle of each edge,\nmeeting in the center.  Combining this with the other operations also\ngives genus 13.  7 is possible by drilling holes from the vertices and faces,\nall meeting together at the center. I still don't know how to do 1, 2, and 10.\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
