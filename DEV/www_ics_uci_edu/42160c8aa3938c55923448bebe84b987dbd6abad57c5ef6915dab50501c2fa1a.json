Two na\u00efve solutions are\nto store the graph using O(n) bits, or to explicitly store the distance\nmatrix with O(k2 log n) bits. The only lower bounds are from the seminal work\nof Gavoille, Peleg, Prennes, and Raz [SODA\u201901], who rule out compressions\ninto a polynomially smaller number of bits, for weighted planar graphs, but\nleave a large gap for unweighted planar graphs. For example, when\n$k=\\sqrt{n}$, the upper bound is $O(n)$ and their constructions imply an\n$\\Omega(n^{3/4})$ lower bound. This gap is directly related to other major\nopen questions in labeling schemes, dynamic algorithms, and compact routing.\nOur main result is a new compression of the planar graph metric into\n$\\tilde{O}(\\min(k^2, \\sqrt{k\\dot n}))$ bits, which is optimal up to log\nfactors. Our data structure circumvents an $\\tilde{O}(k^2)$ lower bound of\nKrauthgamer, Nguyen, and Zondiner [SIDMA\u201914] for compression using minors,\nand the lower bound of Gavoille et al. for compression of weighted planar\ngraphs. This is an unexpected and decisive proof that weights can make planar\ngraphs inherently more complex. Moreover, we design a new Subset Distance\nOracle for planar graphs with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{k\\dot n})$ space, and\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ query time.\nOur work carries strong messages to related fields. In particular, the famous\n$O(n^{1/2})$ vs. $\\Omega(n^{1/3})$ gap for distance labeling schemes in\nplanar graphs cannot be resolved with the current lower bound techniques. On\nthe positive side, we introduce the powerful tool of unit-monge to planar\ngraph algorithms.\n\n<p>\n(Based on a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975031.35\">paper</a> \nby Amir Abboud, Pawel Gawrychowski, Shay Mozes, Oren Weimann [SODA 18])\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
