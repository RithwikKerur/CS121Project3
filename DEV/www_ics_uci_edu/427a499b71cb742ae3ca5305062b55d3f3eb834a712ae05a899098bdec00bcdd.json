This assignment is worth about 50% of the overall assignment score in the class.</FONT>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B>  Evaluate the usability of\na website or application chosen from the  alternatives below and propose a validated\nredesign of the site or application.  The alternatives are</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<li><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The ICS Undergraduate Education site, <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/\">www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/</a>. This site serves as the main source of academic information about the School of ICS at UCI.</FONT></li>\n<!--\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>[Original: The UCI Computer Store, <A HREF=\"http://www.computerstore.uci.edu\">http://www.computerstore.uci.edu</A>] [Revised:  At present, the UCI Boookstore is revising its own site to include what used to be on the Computer Store site.  The new site is <a href=\"http://book.uci.edu/\">http://book.uci.edu</a>; computers and related products are located under the Tech tab.  It's still somewhat under construction, but that just gives you more opportunities to propose a redesign.]</FONT></LI>\n-->\n<BR>\n<LI><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>UCI's WebReg, <A HREF=\"http://www.reg.uci.edu/webreg\">www.reg.uci.edu/webreg</A> (possibly including parts of WebSoc, <a href=\"http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/\">http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/</a>).</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Customer-operated checkout stations (as deployed at many large grocery stores and other retail establishments)</FONT></LI>\n\n</UL>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>If you have a fourth alternative you'd like to work on, check with us right away.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>This assignment has three phases: Evaluate\n  the existing site or application, redesign it to improve the shortcomings you identified\n  (including user tests of the new design), and propose the new design to\n  the  individual or organization in charge.  Be sure to read the entire assignment right away so\n  you&#39;re aware of everything that&#39;s involved.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You will work on this assignment in groups\nof three or four.  We estimate that the increase in coordination and communication\nnecessary in a four-person group roughly equals the decrease in individual\nworkload over a three-person group and we expect that the products of three-person groups will be\nat least as complete and thorough as the  results of four-person groups. In forming your groups, it would be wise to compare schedules, other obligations, and level of commitment to the class; your work will go most easily if all group members are roughly compatible in these respects. All members of the group will receive the same score (unless there are circumstances more extraordinary than any I've run into in the past)</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Each of the alternatives poses its own challenges, which your group needs to handle as best it can. WebReg, for example, is a &quot;live&quot; system; you can only test aspects of it that you're actually authorized to use. The checkout stations are also &quot;live&quot;; it would probably be wise to observe their operation only when the store isn't busy and only after getting permission from the store management (imagine how you'd feel if you were a customer with a bunch of people  hanging around the checkout station watching you and taking notes).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As in past assignments, when we give page\n    counts here we&#39;re referring to single-spaced text in 10- or 12-point\n    type with one-inch margins.  We encourage helpful illustrations, but illustrations\ndo not count towards the page limits.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part I:  Evaluate the existing site</B>\n </FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Determine three or four typical tasks that a user might\nperform on the site or with the application (e.g., \n<!--compare the laptop computers available for under $1500 \nor\npay for purchases with a debit card\n-->\nfind out when you can make an appointment with a counselor or whether you can take Informatics 131 on a P/NP basis).  Choose tasks that\nare realistic, broadly representative of what users might want to do on\nthe site, and substantial enough that the user can&#39;t complete them with\njust a few clicks in a minute or two. (The design changes you will propose in the next part should be based on the flaws you identify in this evaluation. If you already have in mind some particular changes, choose user tasks now that you think will point up problems that your contemplated changes will address.)</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Find at least three people who aren&#39;t enrolled\nin our class but who might be typical users of your site or application.  Have each person, one at a time, do a walkthrough of the\nsite, attempting to complete each of your three or four tasks.  Follow the walkthrough\nguidelines discussed in class and in the book:  Encourage the users to narrate\nwhat they&#39;re thinking and what problems or questions they&#39;re encountering.\n One team member should encourage the user to talk through the process (using\nnon-judgemental, non-leading prompts); the other(s) should observe and take\nnotes on the difficulties that come up. One good way to summarize the results of these walkthroughs would be to create a table with a row for each user and a column for each task; in the cells, write what happened with that user on that task: mistakes, questions, time taken, clicks or keytrokes required [not all of those, but whichever are relevant to your testing].</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>For web sites, use the guidelines in the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/courses/ICS104/lit/Farkas&Farkas-TC.pdf\">Farkas &amp; Farkas paper</A>\n(which you read as part of the previous assignment) to categorize the usability\nproblems your users encountered. For other applications, use Farkas &amp; Farkas where appropriate and otherwise use other guidelines from the course.</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Write a usability evaluation report of at\nleast two and at most three pages, which could include the table mentioned above. Describe very briefly what your evaluation\nprocess was and at more length what results you found, referring to the\nFarkas guidelines where applicable.  This will eventually\nbe an appendix to your redesign proposal, so you should write it with an\neye towards convincing the site management that you have made a thorough,\nmethodologically sound evaluation and that the flaws you identified are\nmore than just your personal opinion.  Of course you must also write in\na polite, professional tone; the site management won&#39;t take your advice\nif they feel it&#39;s nasty, sarcastic, or making fun of them.</FONT>\n<BR><BR>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Try to be comprehensive, addressing most of\nthe major flaws, even if that means overlooking minor issues or repeated\ninstances of the same problems.  (If a site includes many links that are\nhard to identify, for example, just say once something like, &quot;Many\nlinks, such as the &#39;Policies&#39; link on the home page, are hard to\nidentify as links because they&#39;re not distinguished from other content.\n Farkas guideline 1.1 says, &#39;Be sure that all links indicate that they\nare links.&#39; &quot;  Don&#39;t list every link that has a problem; that\nwill fill up the available space before you have time to cover most of the\nimportant issues.)  It&#39;s a good strategy to mention some successful\naspects of the site, since it will make your report sound less unremittingly\ncritical and thus more palatable to the site management, but your main goal\nis to propose a redesign so most of your report should address areas for\nimprovement.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part II:  Redesign the site</B></FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Develop a new design for the site or application, one that\nimproves the areas you identified in your usability evaluation.  The changes you propose should mainly be changes that address problems your prior user walkthroughs identified. Don't just make a bunch of changes <em>you</em> think would be a good idea; the point is that your redesign address the problems found in your initial user testing. Focus mainly\non global issues of navigation and usability; don&#39;t spend much of your\ntime polishing details like typefaces and graphics and the wording of the\ntext on the pages.</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Build a prototype of your new design using\nMockingbird; check with us if you think Mockingbird isn't an appropriate tool for the prototype you need to build.</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Test your prototype informally on each other\nduring your design, making changes as necessary.</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Find at least three people who aren&#39;t in\nthe class; they don&#39;t have to be the same people who you used before,\nbut they may be.  With each person, walk through your prototype, asking\nthe user to perform each of the original three or four tasks and any others that\nyou think are appropriate or necessary.  As always, follow the guidelines\nfor working with users. </FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As flaws or improvements become apparent during\nyour user testing, adjust your design and prototype and re-test the changed\naspects.  Keep iterating until you are satisfied with your design.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part III:  Propose your new design</B></FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Write a proposal of three to five pages describing\nyour redesign.  The major part of the proposal should describe the design\nand how it improves the usability issues you identified in Part I.  Of course\nyou will include illustrations as appropriate.</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A smaller part of your proposal, not more\nthan a page out of the maximum of five, should describe your prototyping\nand evaluation process and what changes resulted from that user testing.\nWe&#39;re assuming here that the site management is interested in the process\nand how thorough a job you did.  This part might not always reflect reality;\nthe typical real-world proposal probably wouldn&#39;t describe the false\nstarts and intermediate steps towards the solution.  But in this case, include\nit.</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Share your Mockingbird prototype: Using the Share icon on Mockinbird's toolbar, get a URL for your project and paste that URL into the proposal document you're submitting. The default sharing settings should allow anyone with the URL to view your prototype.</FONT></LI>\n<br>\n<li><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4></font><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>Submit your proposal document via Checkmate.</font></li>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Submit a PDF export of your Mockingbird site via Checkmate. If you're not using Mockingbird, submit other documentation of your prototype(s) (e.g., photos of your paper prototypes).</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Submit your usability evaluation from Part\n  I via Checkmate.</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A realistic proposal would have a cover letter,\na single simple page in business letter format whose body would say something\nlike, &quot;Enclosed is our proposal for the redesign of your web site.\n We hope you find it useful and we look forward to hearing from you.&quot;\n But you do not have to write or submit a cover letter for this assignment.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<br>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part IV: Attribution </B></FONT></P>\n<UL>\n  <LI> <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Submit a half-page via Checkmate that describes the contributions made by each member of your team. This is not for grading purposes; except in the most extraordinary of circumstances, all team members receive the same score. But it will help us in the future (for refining the assignment or for letters of recommendation) to know who was responsible for what parts of the work.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>If you would like to ask the site management\nwhat their goals and requirements are, you may do that \nby sending Email to i131@uci.edu.\n<!--through the NoteBoard\n  set up for this class at </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">eee.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>. -->\n    Don&#39;t pester the actual management of the site.\n<!--\task your questions\n    through the NoteBoard and the instructor will respond as if he were the\n    management.  Everyone in the class may read the exchanges on the NoteBoard,\n    since requirements clarifications apply equally to everyone.  [Also, everyone\n    should use the EEE NoteBoard system because we might ask an exam question\n    about it and how it compares with newsgroups or other broadcast communications\n    channels.]  Questions on other aspects of the assignment may be asked in\nclass, in section, or by Email to the instructor. -->\n</FONT></P>\n<!--\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>In the interest of full disclosure, everyone\nshould know that Levin&#39;s Shoes and Dry Goods is owned by the instructor&#39;s\nbrother-in-law, Robert Levin  We included it here as a fresh alternative\nto the UCI Computer Store site, which presumably is already familiar to everyone,\nand as a site where students&#39; recommendations might be put into practice.\n If Mr. Levin chooses to redesign his site and incorporate your ideas, he\nmay give you credit on the site (which you could refer to on your r&eacute;sum&eacute;)\nbut he&#39;s under no obligation to compensate you in any other way.  If\nyou don&#39;t care for this arrangement, you have two alternatives:  First,\nyou may work on the UCI Computer Store site instead (which also has no obligation\nto use your ideas or compensate you).  Second, you may evaluate and redesign\ndrygoodstore.com but state clearly at the top of your proposal that you\ndo not wish your proposal sent to the owner.  In the latter case, your work\nwill still be graded on the same basis (which means that you still have\nto write it in the same polite, professional tone).</FONT><BR>\n</P>\n-->\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Written by David G.
