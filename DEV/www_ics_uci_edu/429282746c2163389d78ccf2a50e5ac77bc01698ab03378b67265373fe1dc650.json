An oblivious\nbarely random online algorithm is a barely random online algorithm\nwhich chooses its distribution prior to serving the first request.\nAlthough a number of barely random algorithms have been presented\nin the literature, there has been, up to this point, no formal\nstudy of the properties of this class. Most researchers would\nprobably agree that such algorithms are desirable, in that they\nconserve a precious resource---random bits. Such algorithms are\nalso desirable in that they are generally easier to analyze than\nalgorithms which use an unbounded number of random choices.\nHowever, it is important to consider the possible tradeoffs. The\nformal study of barely random online algorithms is initiated here.\nIt is shown that barely random online algorithms are, under certain\nrestrictions, no more powerful than oblivious barely random online\nalgorithms. A general technique for proving lower bounds for barely\nrandom online algorithms is presented. This technique is an\napplication of the well known von Neumann/Yao principle. For\nseveral simple online problems, lower and upper bounds for barely\nrandom online algorithms are given. The power of barely random\nalgorithms for the ski rental problem is completely characterized.\nOther problems investigated include paging, total completion time\nscheduling, m-machine scheduling, interval scheduling and the cow\npath problem.</p>\n\n<h3>Thursday, April 30, 1998, 1:00PM, in ICS 432</h3>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
