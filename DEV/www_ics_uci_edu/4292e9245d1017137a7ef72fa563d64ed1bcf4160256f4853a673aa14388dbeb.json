The development of the\nclass QMA (the quantum analog of NP) has shed light on the limits of\nquantum computers as well as the complexity of fundamental problems in\ncondensed matter physics. The connection between these areas arises\nfrom the close relationship between the complexity of constraint\nsatisfaction problems and the properties of ground states of local\nHamiltonians describing quantum systems. This talk will be a brief\nsurvey of how QMA has helped inform our understanding of quantum\ncomputation and entanglement as well as some of the questions at the\nforefront of quantum Hamiltonian complexity.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
