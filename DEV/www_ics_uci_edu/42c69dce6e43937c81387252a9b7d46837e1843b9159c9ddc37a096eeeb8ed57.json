The project derives its name from the Cypress tree that represents durability and sustainability\r\n <p>\r\nAdvances in sensing, embedded computing, and communication technologies offer unprecedented \r\nopportunities to add &#8220;intelligence&#8221; into physical systems and enable the creation of Instrumented Cyber-\r\nPhysical Spaces (ICPSs).  Example critical infrastructures include airports, energy distribution networks, \r\nand organizations such as schools and hospitals. Example critical applications range from surveillance to \r\nsecurity and situation-aware emergency response.  For  ICPSs to transform our lives through new \r\nfunctionality, robustness, and efficiency, they must provide dependable infrastructure components in \r\nthe presence of failures and disruptions and generate dependable information  in the face of errors in \r\nsensing, communications, and computations. Dynamic  adaptability  of large ICPSs that employ \r\nheterogeneous sensing and actuation technologies becomes the  fundamental enabler for dependable \r\nICPSs. <p>\r\nDependability, as defined by the IFIP 10.4 Working  Group on Dependable Computing and Fault \r\nTolerance, refers to the trustworthiness of computing systems that allows reliance to be justifiably placed \r\non the services it delivers. \r\n\r\nDependability constitutes a variety of non-functional requirements including \r\navailability, reliability, maintainability, safety, and integrity.  In the context of ICPS, dependability can \r\nbroadly be classified at two interdependent levels that, combined, can provide a trustworthy platform for \r\nbuilding applications:<p>  \r\n&#8226;  <i>Infrastructure Dependability</i> &#8211; how dependable are the underlying infrastructure components \r\n(e.g., sensors, networks, actuators, computing/storage elements, software environments) in the \r\npresence of diverse failures that may lead to disruptions, and<p>  \r\n&#8226;  <i>Information Dependability</i> &#8211; how dependable is the information generated by the underlying \r\ninfrastructure given errors/uncertainty in sensor readings and data analysis mechanisms.  <p>\r\n\r\nIn this project, we are expoiting an &#8220;observe-analyze-adapt&#8221; (OAA) architecture in which an ICPS has a \r\nmodel of itself, its objectives, and its effects on the environment; the ICPS achieves dependability \r\nobjectives through adaptation using runtime application of formal analysis methods. The proposed \r\ndependability techniques are cross-layer in nature and range from combining multiple networking and \r\nmessaging technologies to adaptive sensing and information fusion. <p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"images/figure1.png\" alt=\"software architecture\" width=\"50%\"/>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFigure 1 illustrates our approach to designing \r\nICPS management software - using OAA approach  where a self-\r\nobserving, introspecting system will initiate a logical \r\nadaptation of its components to meet dependability \r\nneeds.  ICPS systems and devices (designed using a \r\ncross-layer architecture) supply dynamic streams of \r\ninformation that are used by application which in turn \r\nadapt the usage and execution of the infrastructure.  \r\nSince ICPS systems are dynamic, observation and monitoring of a system and its evolution is critical to \r\nenabling dependability. At the heart of the system  is the ICPS StateDB that implements the &#8220;observe&#8221; \r\naspect of the OAA cycle. A formal modeling and reasoning component allows for concrete specification \r\nof the ICPS system and analyzes the current system  state to reason about the dependability properties; \r\nproviding a limited, but focused &#8220;analyze&#8221; component in the OAA cycle.  The outcome of the analysis \r\nwill help us generate adaptations that comply with dependability constraints.  The adaptation component \r\nmakes changes to deal with dynamics in the environment, implements human-driven changes by \r\nembedding human activities and human-in-the-loop decisions, and deploys the logical adaptations into the \r\nphysical ICPS infrastructure. A key feature of our approach (see right side of Figure 2) is the ability to \r\nperform cross-layer analysis and adaptation, both vertically (i.e., across abstraction layers ranging  from \r\nthe application, to middleware, OS, and hardware) and horizontally, across geographically distributed \r\ncomponents interconnected via multiple, heterogeneous networks.  Thus OAA at the infrastructure level \r\nenables stability of the entire operational infrastructure. The proposed effort focuses on system-level \r\ntechniques for dependable CPS operation &#8211; human interactions occur via applications that specify their \r\ndependability needs.   <p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"images/figure2.png\" alt=\"cross layer adaption\" width=\"100%\" />\r\n<p>\r\nThere are four main research tasks included in our project:\r\n<br>\r\n1.Dependable, Cross-Layer Observation and State Management<br>\r\n2.Formal Methods for CPS System Dependability Analysis <br>\r\n3.Adaptations to Support Infrastructure Dependability<br>\r\n4.Adaptations to Support Information Dependability<p>\r\n\r\nResearch Task 1 corresponds to the observe step in OAA. In this task we will generate a cross-layer \r\nspecification of the underlying system, its abilities and application dependability needs using quantitative \r\nand qualitative analysis and design an ICPS state capture service. For the analyze step, we use lightweight \r\nformal methods to analyze the current state of the  system, given an infrastructure and application to \r\ndetermine violations of dependability needs (Task 2). Finally, the adapt step is investigated in Research \r\nTasks 3 and 4 where adaptations are designed to enhance infrastructure and information dependability.  <p>\r\n\r\nWe aim to develop: (1) an array of specific cross-layer adaptation techniques to support infrastructure \r\nand information dependability in ICPSs using the OAA paradigm, (2) a formal modeling framework \r\nsupporting executable formal models to maintain runtime system models and formal analysis techniques \r\nto guide the adaptation process, and (3) the incorporation of (1) and (2) into middleware services that \r\nprovide dependability-aware ICPS state management and adaptation. Responsphere/I-sensorium, are real, NSF-funded \r\nICPS infrastructure on the University of California at Irvine (UCI) campus will be used to identify \r\nresearch challenges, concretize our research, and test and validate our ideas with an emergency response \r\napplication (situational awareness in firefighting). We will build on our experience and software \r\ndeveloped in the DHS-funded project SAFIRE and prior NSF project RESCUE to use Responsphere in \r\ntesting for emergency drills planned in collaboration with our first responder partners. <p>\r\n<br><br>\r\n<strong>CYPRESS 2011 Poster<strong>\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"styles/rescue.css\" media=\"all\">\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"jquery-latest.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n$(document).ready(function(){\r\n//Larger thumbnail preview\r\n$(\"ul.thumb li\").hover(function() {\r\n$(this).css({'z-index' : '10'});\r\n$(this).find('img').addClass(\"hover\").stop()\r\n.animate({\r\n\tmarginTop: '-390px',\r\n\tmarginLeft: '-250px',\r\n\ttop: '50%',\r\n\tleft: '50%',\r\n\twidth: '1200px',\r\n\theight: '920px',\r\n\tpadding: '10px'\r\n}, 200);\r\n} , function() {\r\n$(this).css({'z-index' : '0'});\r\n$(this).find('img').removeClass(\"hover\").stop()\r\n.animate({\r\n\tmarginTop: '-60',\r\n\tmarginLeft: '-60',\r\n\ttop: '50%',\r\n\tleft: '50%',\r\n\twidth: '100px',\r\n\theight: '100px',\r\n\tpadding: '5px'\r\n}, 200);\r\n});\r\n//Swap Image on Click\r\n$(\"ul.thumb li a\").click(function() {\r\nvar mainImage = $(this).attr(\"href\");//Find Image Name\r\n$(\"#main_view img\").attr({ src: mainImage });\r\nreturn false;\r\n});\r\n});\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<body>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"container\">\r\n\t<div id=\"col\">\r\n\t\t<ul class=\"thumb\">\r\n\t\t\t<li><a href=\"images/CYPRESSPOSTER2011v3.jpg\"><img src=\"images/CYPRESSPOSTER2011v3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></li>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- end of add your content here -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    <!-- InstanceEndEditable --><div class=\"clearer\"></div></div>\r\n<div class=\"clearer\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n  <div id=\"divFooter\">\r\n  <a href=\"index.html\">Home</a> | <a href=\"people.html\">People</a> | <a href=\"publications.html\">Publications</a> | <a href=\"news.html\">Events</a> | <a href=\"all_videos_demos.html\">Videos and demos</a><br />\r\n\r\n  This page was last updated on\r\n  <!-- #BeginDate format:fcAm1a -->Thursday, March 24, 2011  <!-- #EndDate -->\r\n    <br />\r\n    Webmaster: Zhijing DOT Qin AT gmail DOT com\r\n<!--<a href=\"mailto:rescue@ics.uci.edu\">Comments or Questions </a></div>-->\r\n</div>\r\n  <p align=\"center\" class=\"tightline style1\"> <br><br>This material is based upon work supported by the<a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/\"> National Science Foundation</a> under\r\n  ward Numbers <a href=\" \" target=\"_blank\">1063596</a>, <a href=\" \" target=\"\">1059436</a>.\r\n  Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation<br />\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
