Is the arrangement <I>simple</I>\n(containing no three lines that meet at a single point)?\nDo we count as edges the connections that wrap around \"through infinity\"\nconnecting the first and last crossings on each line?\nWe might also ask whether we allow parallel lines or not, but unlike the\nprevious two questions this does not seem to be important in determining\nthe chromatic number of line arrangements.\n\n<H2>Simple arrangements without wraparound</H2>\n\nWe first consider the graphs arising from simple arrangements, in which\nwe do not allow wraparound edges.  In this case a simple greedy algorithm\nshows that the chromatic number is at most three.  We can assume (by\nrotating the arrangement if necessary) that no line is vertical.\nThen simply color the vertices from left to right.  Each vertex\nhas at most two neighbors already colored, so one of three colors is always available.\nIt is also easy to construct arrangements requiring three colors.\n\n<H2>Non-simple arrangements without wraparound</H2>\n\nWithout wraparound, a planar line arrangement forms a planar graph,\nso the four-color theorem tells us its chromatic number is at most four.\nThe following example shows that four colors are sometimes needed\n(the arrangement contains other intersections outside the ones shown, that are not necessary to determine the chromatic number):\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"pent.gif\"></CENTER>\n\n<H2>Simple arrangements with wraparound</H2>\n\nWrapping edges \"through infinity\" to connect the first and last vertices on each line causes some complications in coloring the arrangement.  The resulting graph is no longer planar: if we tried to draw the wrapped around connections we would find that\nthey cross each other.  Instead the arrangement lives on a surface other\nthan the usual Euclidean plane, known as the \"projective plane\", which\ndiffers somewhat in its properties.  For instance the four-color theorem\ndoes not apply to projective-planar graphs; instead they may require up\nto five colors.  However only four colors are needed for simple\narrangements with wraparound.\n<P>\nTo see this, note that any simple arrangement forms a graph in which\neach vertex has exactly four neighbors.  A well-known result in graph\ntheory (Brooks' theorem) states that if the vertices in a graph have at\nmost <I>k</I> neighbors, and the graph is neither complete nor an odd\ncycle, then the graph is <I>k</I>-colorable.\nIn our case, an odd cycle clearly has fewer than four neighbors per vertex,\nso the only other problem case would be the complete graph K<sub>5</sub>.\nAnd although K<sub>5</sub> can be embedded on the projective plane\n(one embedding is shown below) it can not come from a line arrangement, since\nits does not have a triangular number of vertices.\n(A simple <I>n</I>-line arrangement has exactly <I>n</I>(<I>n</I>-1)/2 vertices.)\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"proj-k5.gif\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nSo Brooks' theorem tells us that four colors suffice to color simple\narrangements with wraparound.\nThe following example shows a matching lower bound: at least four colors\nmay be required.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"star.gif\"></CENTER>\n\n<H2>Non-simple arrangements with wraparound</H2>\n\nAny graph in the projective plane can be colored with at most six colors.\n(One relatively easy way to see this is to use\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Euler's formula</A>\nto show that there exists a vertex of degree at most five; therefore one\ncan remove that vertex, color the remaining graph recursively, and then add the vertex\nback with at least one color available to color it.)\nAnd some projective-planar graphs, for instance, the following\ncomplete graph on six vertices, require six colors.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"proj-k6.gif\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nThis graph's vertices have odd numbers of neighbors so it does not come\nfrom a line arrangement.\nThe following example (known in projective\ngeometry as the \"complete quadrangle\") shows that five colors may sometimes be\nneeded for the graphs coming fromline arrangements.  The three outer\nvertices and the center one are all connected\nto each other, and so require four different colors.  The remaining\nthree vertices are each connected to these four and require a fifth\ncolor.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"quadrangle.gif\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nWe now sketch a proof that five colors are always sufficient.\nA line arrangement always has a degree-four vertex (Sylvester's theorem);\nthis can be seen by applying \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Euler's formula</A>\nto show that there exists a vertex of degree at most five, but then observing\nthat all vertex degrees are even.  So, let <I>v</I> be such a vertex,\ncontained on line L.\n<P>\nForm a graph G by collapsing all vertices on line L into a single point;\nthen G is a planar graph.  More technically, L can be assumed to be the \"line\nat infinity\" of the projective plane, and the collapse of L produces the\n\"one-point completion\" of the Euclidean plane, which is just a sphere,\nand graphs embedded on the sphere are always planar.  So by the\nfour-color theorem G can be colored with at most four colors.\n<P>\nIf we\nundo the collapse, to get back to the line arrangement we're interested\nin coloring, then everything on L will be colored the same color, say red, L will have\nno red neighbors, and the rest of the arrangement will be colored ok.\nWe now recolor the vertices on L to make a five-coloring of the whole arrangement.\nBecause we've only used four colors so far, one color, say blue, is still unused.\nThe vertices on L form a cycle, which can be thought of as a path\nconnected at its endpoints by the special vertex <I>v</I>.  We simply change\nthe color of every other vertex on that path from red to blue.\nFinally, we need to choose a color for <I>v</I>.  If L has an odd number of vertices,\none neighbor of <I>v</I> on L might be red and one might be blue.\nBut only two of the three remaining colors can be used by the other two\nneighbors of <I>v</I>, so there is always some color\navailable to color <I>v</I> and complete\nthe five-coloring of the arrangement.\n\n<H2>Summary</H2>\n\nWe have described coloring problems for simple and non-simple line arrangements,\nwith and without edges that wrap around through infinity.\nSimple arrangements without wraparound have chromatic number three.\nNon-simple arrangements without wraparound have chromatic number four.\nSimple arrangements with wraparound have chromatic number four.\nAnd non-simple arrangements with wraparound have chromatic number five.\n\n<P><HR><P>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"index.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
