Periodically you will have to instruct new users on how to use\nGmail  You might write an introductory document, explaining\nthe basics of electronic mail and the kinds of operations one might expect\nto perform (creating a message, sending it, receiving a message, printing\nit, saving it, and so on); later in that document, or in another document,\nyou might give a tutorial providing the details of carrying out those operations\n(the specific commands to use), perhaps with a set of examples the reader\nwould follow.  You might also give an oral introduction to Gmail\nto groups of new users or create a video of that introduction. </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>In addition, you might think that Gmail\ncould be improved in various ways (such as a fancier user interface or\nadditional features).  Probably you would have to convince someone that these changes would be worth implementing.  For UCI's Gmail, it could be the director of UCI's Office of Information Technology or the director of the Gmail project at Google; for some other system, it might be your\nboss or a committee in charge of deciding what software enhancements are\nmost important. You would\nmake your case both in a written memo and in an oral presentation.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Any change in an existing system is likely\nto disrupt the system&#39;s current users.  If your change were implemented,\nyou would want to reassure the current users that the new system will be\nbetter for them&mdash;to &quot;sell them,&quot; in other words, on your changes.\n Again you might prepare something written, such as a flyer or brochure\nor memo or web page, and also make a short oral presentation or announcement\nwith the same intent.  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>For this assignment, you will choose some\nsoftware that you&#39;re familiar with and do each of these things.  As\nyou develop each of these different documents (and their corresponding oral\npresentations), focus on how the audience for each document is different&mdash;they\nhave different experience, different needs, and so on, which means that\nhow you write for each will be different, too.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage I&mdash;choosing a system:</B>  First,\nyou must decide what system you will use for this assignment.  Your system\nmay be conventional application software; it may also be a web site with\nsignificantly complex navigation or interaction.  By Thursday, April 4,\nsend a brief message to theTA, Steve Slota (</FONT><code><A HREF=\"mailto:sslota@uci.edu\">sslota@uci.edu</A></code><FONT  SIZE=4>),\nthat names the system, describes it if it&#39;s not something everyone&#39;s\nfamiliar with, and sketches out the kind of changes you&#39;re thinking\nof proposing.  Based on his feedback, you will give a one- to two-minute\noral presentation of this information to the class on April 11.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage II&mdash;introduction for novices:  </B>You\nwill write an introduction to the system for novice users, of three to four\npages.  This document should give a high-level description of the system\nand its capabilities, describing what tasks the system will perform and\ngiving the necessary background.  It should not get into the tedious minor\ndetails of which keys to press or which menu items to choose; the &quot;Writing\nInstructions&quot; project covers that kind of writing, and those details\nwould extend this assignment far beyond four pages in any case.  A good\ndraft of this is due on April 17; the final version is due Apri 24.  (All written\nassignments are due at the start of class.)  You will also give to the class\na two-minute oral version of this introduction (on April 18 or 23); we plan to videotape\nthese presentations for review in section.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage III&mdash;proposal for change:  </B>You\nwill write a proposal for changing this system, of five to six pages plus\na brief single-page cover letter.  Address this proposal to whatever decision-making\nauthority is appropriate for your software:  perhaps the company that publishes\nit, perhaps an individual or committee in your own organization.  Try to\nfind out the actual name of the actual person or group who actually has\nthe authority to make the changes you suggest, and write your proposal with\nthat person or group in mind.  Your goal should be to produce a proposal\nyou can actually send.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>A draft of your proposal is due for joint\nediting in class on April 25; a revision based on the joint editing (including\nyour editor&#39;s comments) is due on May 2.  On May 16, you will give\nyour final oral proposal for change to the appropriate decision maker; each\npresentation should take four minutes.  (We will continue as necessary\non May 22, 23, and 28; we will circulate a sign-up sheet so everyone knows when he\nor she will be speaking.)  The final written version of your proposal is\ndue on May 21.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>This change proposal is the most formal presentation\nyou will make.  Visual aids are customary in such presentations, and you\nwill prepare them (in the form of PowerPoint slides or the equivalent) and use them when you\npresent your proposal.  You will submit a draft of these slides (on paper)\nwith the draft of your proposal on April 25; you will revise them along with\nyour revision due on May 2, you will use them in your oral presentation,\nand you will turn them in with your final version.  You will find PowerPoint\neasy to learn even if you&#39;ve never seen it before, but we would recommend\ntrying it out more than just a day before the first draft is due. Instead of PowerPoint, you may use Apple's Keynote or open-source equivalents to PowerPoint or even Prezi.com; however, any compatibility issues are your responsibility to resolve before your presentation. </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage IV&mdash;promotion for users:  </B>Finally,\nyou will prepare a one-page flyer, brochure, memo, or web page announcing,\ndescribing, and promoting your change to the current users of the system.\n This &quot;promotion piece&quot; may be one- or two-sided and may be relatively\ninformal in tone&mdash;just so that it gets the message across without its readers\ndismissing it as a joke.  A draft is due for joint editing in class on May 30; the final version is due on June 4.  You will also give a two-minute\noral presentation with the same focus, in class on June 4.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Each part of this assignment shares the same\nunderlying subject matter.  What&#39;s different in each part is the intended\naudience (and thus what knowledge you assume, what you cover explicitly,\nand the level of formality).  The table on the next page shows this.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Suggestions and advice:</B>  Choose software\nthat you know something about, and more importantly, that you care about.\n The best writing (and the easiest for the writer) is writing where the\nwriter has experience with the topic and really cares about getting it across\nto the reader.  So choose something that matters to you.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Always be mindful of your audience.  Novice\nusers have different needs and a different set of assumptions than decision-makers,\nfor example.  Moreover, the appropriate level of formality is different\nfor each of your different audiences.  This table will help you focus on\nthese distinctions:</FONT>\n<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=1 WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=1>\n<COL WIDTH=33%><COL WIDTH=16%><COL WIDTH=34%><COL WIDTH=17%>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=33% VALIGN=TOP>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4>P<FONT SIZE=3>ART</FONT></FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=16% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>D<FONT SIZE=3>UE </FONT>D<FONT SIZE=3>ATES</FONT></FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=34% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>A<FONT SIZE=3>UDIENCE</FONT></FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>F<FONT SIZE=3>ORMALITY</FONT></FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=33% VALIGN=TOP>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4>Change proposal synopsis (oral), describing\nwhat changes you&#39;re proposing</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=16% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Email 4/4\n<BR>\n<BR>\noral 4/11</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=34% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Our class, who may know something about the\nsoftware (depending on your choice) and who may have suggestions about the\nchanges you propose</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Informal</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=33% VALIGN=TOP>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4>Introduction to the current system (written,\noral)</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=16% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>draft 4/17\n<BR>\n<BR>\n oral 4/18\n<BR>\n<BR>\nfinal 4/24</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=34% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Novices, unfamiliar with the software, who\nneed to learn its purpose and basic functionality</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Friendly yet professional</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=33% VALIGN=TOP>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4>Change proposal (written, oral), describing\nand justifying the changes</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=16% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>[including         slides and cover memo]\n<BR>\n<BR>\ndraft 4/25\n<BR>\n<BR>\nrevision 5/2\n<BR>\n<BR>\noral 5/16, 22, 23, 28\n<BR>\n<BR>\nfinal 5/21</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=34% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Decision makers, who know about the software\nbut must be convinced of the need to change (and the feasibility and advisability\nof the changes you propose)</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Correct and professional, addressing corporate\nhigher-ups</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=33% VALIGN=TOP>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4>Change promotion (written, oral)</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=16% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>draft 5/30\n<BR>\n<BR>\noral 6/4\n<BR>\n<BR>\nfinal 6/4</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=34% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Current users of the software, who know what\nit does now but need to know what the changes mean</FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Brief and\n<BR>informal, yet professional</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE>\n</P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>We encourage your effective use of graphics,\nthough graphics may not reduce your prose page count below the minimum.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>To the extent applicable, you should state\nyour sources of information in your written proposal, backing up whatever\nfacts and figures you used.  This need <I>not</I> be gathered all together\nat the end as a formal bibliography&mdash;it is better to mention the name of\nthe source at the point where you use its information in the body of the\npaper.  If your word processor supports automatic footnotes, use them, but\ndo not waste time trying to include footnotes manually&mdash;an in-line citation\nis fine.  Citations should provide enough detail to allow the reader to\nfind the cited work and follow up on the information and all the citations\nin a document should follow a consistent format, but the precise format\nyou use is not crucial for this assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>There&#39;s a big difference between spoken\nand written language.  For the oral portions of this assignment, do not\nsimply read from a script.  Of course you will use notes, but speak naturally\nrather than reading a &quot;canned&quot; speech.  On the other hand, the\npresentations are relatively formal in tone; joking banter and slang are\nnot appropriate.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>We will be happy to advise you on any aspect\nof your proposal.  We&#39;re a valuable resource; take advantage of our\nassistance.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Grading of oral presentations:</B>  Oral\npresentations are nerve-wracking enough for most people without the addition\nof grade pressure.  The main criterion we will use for evaluating your oral\npresentations is that you show up to give them, and that you&#39;re well\nprepared.  We will not grade down significantly for speaking style or loudness\nof voice or oratorical polish, though we do expect that you will try to\naddress your intended audience appropriately.  We will not grade down at\nall for nervousness (though we hope that will abate as the quarter progresses)\nor English pronunciation or the speaker&#39;s personality.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>You will have an opportunity to give your\nclassmates written feedback on their presentations; you will receive some\ncredit towards class participation for each presentation you comment on.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Stage IV alternative:</B>  Instead of doing\nthe promotion piece, you may prepare your own r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover\nletter according to the guidelines described in class.  The promotion piece\ngives you a chance to apply some of the design skills we discussed, but\nworking on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is also valuable.  The choice is yours;\nthe due dates and the course credit are the same with either alternative.</FONT></P>\n<BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
