You should apply at least 2 refactorings. Each refactoring should be either from the lecture or from one of the Websites/books I mentioned in the refactoring lecture. Each use of a refactoring should be carefully motivated in a brief accompanying document.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Deliverables</b><br>\nEach individual must turn in:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">1. A printed copy of their restructured code (just the classes/places where refactorings were applied). Please highlight the lines that were changed.</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">2. A printed document describing:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>* The motivation for each refactoring</p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"Apple-tab-span\">\t</span>* The impact each refactoring has on the design (i.e., how far reaching is the change to incorporate the refactoring?)</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Both of the above can be combined with <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~emilyo/teaching/info122w2015/assignments/assignment3-1.html\">part 1</a> of this assignment, i.e.,</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">* Hand in one copy of your restructured code (with patterns and refactorings applied)</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">* Hand in one accompanying document (addressing both patterns and refactoring)</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><b>Grading</b><br>\nYou will be graded on three things for Assignment 3-2:</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">1. Usefulness of the refactorings</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">2. Rationale</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">3. Level of design understanding shown in your refactorings and rationale</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
