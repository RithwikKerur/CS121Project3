There are\ntwo algorithms described in the paper, the first dealing with <i>m</i>\narc additions in O(<i>m</i><sup>3/2</sup>) time.  This algorithm\nimproves the previous best bound by a logarithmic factor for sparse\nnetworks and is within a constant factor among other algorithms\nsatisfying a natural locality property.  The second algorithm has an\nupper bound of O(<i>n</i><sup>5/2</sup>) time and a lower bound of\n&Omega;(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>2<sup>&radic;2&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i></sup>)\nobtained by relating its performance to a generalization of\nthe <i>k</i>-levels problem of combinatorial geometry.\n</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2397\">a paper</a> in\nACM Transactions on Algorithms 2012 by Bernhard Haeupler, Telikepalli\nKavitha, Rogers Mathew, Siddhartha Sen, and Robert Endre Tarjan.)</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
