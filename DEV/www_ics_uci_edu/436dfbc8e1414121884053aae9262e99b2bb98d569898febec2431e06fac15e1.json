The workshop invitees are computer architects and compiler,\noperating system, and application experts. The main goal of the workshop\nis to discuss future trends in the development of architecture and\nsoftware systems and to explore the assumptions made by the architects  \nabout software systems and by software writers about architecture.\nThe increased complexity in each of these areas calls for increased\ninteraction with researchers from all of the other disciplines to accurately\nassess the potential directions and future trends in architecture and systems.\n</p>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nThe main themes of the workshop are software- and technology-driven and\nconstrained new architectures, compiler/architecture interaction and codesign,\nand application requirements and characteristics.  Both numerical\nand non-numerical applications, such as database, data mining,\nWeb- and Java-based, and (high-performance) embedded applications, are of interest.\nIn all cases a longer-term view and assessment of the future is of most interest.\n</p>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nThis year's special focus is power-aware memory hierarchy.  Today both high-performance\nand embedded processors and systems are concerned with power dissipation. Memory   \nhierarchy is one of the major sources of on-chip and system power consumption. Until\nrecently this concern was primarily addressed via technology and circuit design.  An\nimportant and interesting issue is whether (micro)architectural innovation and compiler\nsupport can make significant contributions to reducing the power dissipation.\n \nWorkshop topics of  interest will deal with this issue and include but are not limited to:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Cache organizations that reduce power consumption\n<li> Use of adaptive techniques in the hierarchy to reduce power consumption\n<li> Power-performance trade-offs in the memory hierarchy\n<li> Compiler techniques to manage the hierarchy to reduce power consumption\n<li> Modeling, benchmarking, performance and power consumption evaluation \n<li> Other microarchtecture and compiler techniques for reducing power consumption \n</ul>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nAdditional workshop areas of interest include the perennial favorites below,\nbut preference will be given to submissions on the above-mentioned topics.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li> Processor design <br>\n<li> Single-chip multiprocessors, multi-chip servers and large-scale multiprocessors <br>\n<li> Memory technology and system organization <br>\n<li> Systems On a Chip (SOC) <br>\n<li> Architecture-compiler interaction and optimization <br>\n<li> Applications and there performance \n</ul>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nThe workshop will consist of sessions combining individual presentations \nwith discussion.  Presentations will be limited to ~20 min to provide sufficient\ntime for discussion.  An ideal presentation will concentrate on trends and future\ndirections in addition to recently obtained results.  Speculation is encouraged.\n</p>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\n<b> Workshop participation is capped at 25 invitees.  </b> <br>\n</p>\n\n\n<H3><B> <a name=\"publ\">  </a> </B></H3>\n<b> Submission and Publication </b> </center>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\n   The invitees wishing to make a presentation should submit\n   an extended abstract, up to 3 pages, by 1/6/01.\n   Submissions should be electronic in postscript  or pdf format.\n   The abstracts will be reviewed and printed in the on-site proceedigns.\n</p>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">\nThe final proceedings consisting of\nfull papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press after the meeting.\nThe papers will undergo an additional review process and be selected for\npublication in the post-proceedings.
