When he uses a name,\nhe knows exactly what he means. All names are local, and can name anything\nyou want. You're allowed to like the name or not, adopt or not.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> This is a version of the web of trust applied to names.\nMaybe we need the PGP model for names.\n<p><b>Carl Hewitt:</b> But its more than just naming people.\n<p><b>Q:</b> Wouldn't devices be genericized, such as \"Mark Day's cell\nphone\"? Some devices are not associated with a person, like a shared printer.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> Ah, but what to name.&nbsp; One way is to name capabilities\n-- It's hard to get universal registration but maybe you really want the\nobject. Like a Mobile Phone which does text paging, I may want to send\na text message to it specifically.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> You're arguing there is a global namespace of devices.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> As devices change over time, a universal registry won't\nwork. It doesn't matter that it's my cell phone. I care that it can receive\nshort messages. What if I have 2 such devices? You could maybe create a\nuniversal registry now, but it would be brittle -- what if we did this\n15 years ago?&nbsp; I think that setting up such a namespace would be futile.\n<p><b>Mike Mealling:</b>&nbsp; Isn't this device naming a red herring?\nWe want to name services, and don't care what device they're mapped to.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> This sounds better to me. By and large, systems have\nbeen established that will route messages, but, what if a sender wants\nto explicitly send to a specific device?\n<p><b>Mike Mealling:</b> But, in that case they'll have local context.\n<p><b>Q (Bob Morgan?): </b>What about Bluetooth?\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> Look at this space, can you imagine yourselves in this\nroom all with multiple bluetooth devices that are talking with each other\nconfiguring themselves to each other?\n<p><b>Mike Mealling:</b> Perhaps we should talk about naming bluetooth\nservices...\n<p><b>Henrik Rood:</b> {mentions a site with many drafts on services in\ncars}. Why not look at 3rd generation mobile.&nbsp; There you find\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; use of links ... identification card ... Many issues have\nbeen dealt with by mobile vendors, and they do have a large namespace.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> My feelings are based on looking at naming in areas\naway from telephony, but I didn't think there had been much progress with\nmobile systems. Should everything be a phone number?\n<p><b>Henrik Rood:</b> The European mobile system is based on smart cards,\nand there are gateways to the Internet. The use of smart cards in Europe\naddress many concerns.&nbsp; For instance my smart card offers services.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> Perhaps I overlooked the idea that telephone numbers\nwill be unique. And that perhaps the end points are nothing but telephone\nnumbers.\n<p><b>Henrik Rood:</b> No not just telephone numbers, but the chip stores\ninformation for you.\n<p><b>Q: </b>Service can be mobile.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> That's portability of the endpoint.\n<p><b>Henrik Rood:</b> But I can use Voice Dialing to find a place for\nyou. Right now in the Netherlands, you have voice dialing for specific\nwords, for example, you can pick up the phone and say \"Coke\" and it will\ndial for you.&nbsp; This is a service that I have from the Telecom.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> This is implemented centrally, right?\n<p><b>Carl Hewitt:</b> Ten years from now, the unrecorder life won't be\nworth living. We will record entire lives on video and exchange video.\nHumpty Dumpty gets along just fine without names. Pointing is just fine.\nNames aren't always character strings!\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> Good point.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> We have socially constructed expectations for devices.\nFor example, is the cell or home phone primary? We assume a cell is more\nimperative than a fixed line, but for me that's not the case. My cell phone\nis for everyone to contact me, and my home phone is just for friends, and\nthat's where I answer if it's important. The terms themselves are of relative\nvalue. I'm sure there are network effects on the notion of concept of devices.\n<p><b>Mike Mealling:</b> There is an interesting interface between the\nIETF and telephony SDOs. There is some discussion of using DNS for telephony\ninformation.\n<p><b>David Rosenblum:</b> Names seem to be used here for humans to name\nthings, but how about names that have to generated quickly and have a short\nlifetime. What about names that machines must generate on the fly to talk\nto each other?\n<p><b>Walt Scacchi:</b> Need guidelines for rolling your own naming schemes.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> I'm concerned about this. The X window system allowed\npeople to make their own window managers. The idea being if you build the\ncapabilities, the people would come an build thier own GUI -- provide just\nenough functionality to roll your own.&nbsp; But it turns out that people\ndidn't want to build their own windowing managers. This was a little underconstrained\nfor many users.\n<p><b>Walt Scacchi:</b> Maybe that's the answer -- <i>evolve</i> towards\na socially determined naming solution. Thus everything is a locally constructed\nname\n<p><b>Bob Morgan: </b>If everything is context dependent, then what about\nthe help desk scenario. Can you please tell me what context you are in?\nHow do you come to a resolution?\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> Support is a very important issue. Don't want names\nto break if a resolver is down for one person, but not for another. This\nis a big challenge.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> A closing thought. The battle in instant messaging\nis over ownership of the namespace.\n<p><b>Mark Day:</b> I don't agree. Microsoft and AOL don't even agree on\nthe business model. AOL wants to control the service, as opposed to the\nmodel where it's just out on the Web and anyone can just link to it.\n<p><b>Esther Dyson:</b> It's a commercial dispute masquerading as a philosophical\ndispute.\n<br>&nbsp;\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
