Clarke, Debra J. Richardson, and Steven J. Zeil in\n<i>Proceeding of the ACM SIGSOFT '88: Third Symposium on Practical\nSoftware Development Environments</i>,\npages 153-162, Boston, November 1988.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nCurrent research indicates that software reliability needs to be achieved \nthrough the careful integration of a number of diverse testing and \nanalysis techniques. To address this need, the TEAM environment has \nbeen designed to support the integration of and experimentation with\nan ever growing number of software testing and analysis tools. To achieve \nthis flexibility, we exploit three design principles: component technology \nso that common underlying functionality is recognized; generic realizations \nso that these common functions can be instantiated as diversely as\npossible; and language independence so that tools can work on multiple \nlanguages, even allowing some tools to be applicable to different phases \nof the software lifecycle. \n\n<P>\n\nThe result is an environment that contains building blocks for easily \nconstructing and experimenting with new testing and analysis techniques. \nAlthough the first prototype has just recently been implemented, we feel \nit demonstrates how modularity, genericity, and language independence \nfurther extensibility and integration.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 26 13:50:25 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
