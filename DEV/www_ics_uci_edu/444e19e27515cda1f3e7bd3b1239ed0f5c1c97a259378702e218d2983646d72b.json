An important property in this context is the \ncentrality of a vertex: the inverse of the average distance to each \nother vertex. We describe a randomized approximation algorithm for \ncentrality in weighted graphs. For graphs exhibiting the small world \nphenomenon, our method estimates the centrality of all vertices\nwith high probability within a (1+epsilon) factor in near-linear time.      \n</p>\n\n<p><b>Note</b>: this talk is to be\ngiven as part of the Southern California Theory Day, so the\ntime will probably be different from the usual 1pm.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
