Please don't\nhesitate to send me e-mail or ask me in lab if you have any questions.<br>\n-- Dan.\n<p>\nGeneral note on scoring: I used a 24 point scale (actually, \n<A HREF=#23>23, see explanation below)</A>\nand (for the most part)\nno fractional scores.  But the homework only counts for 12 points, so the\nscore on your paper was divided in two and rounded up, if necessary, to\nreach the actual score.\n<P>\n<P>\n<A NAME=H2>\nNote also that credit for simply coming up with 5 questions was previously\ngiven at the time the questions were submitted.</A>\nThis amounted to\na maximum of 3 points, and is recorded separately as ``H2''\non the score sheet accessed through the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/doc/ics1c/X/Grades.html\">\nICS 1C Student Score Request Form</A> which lists indivduals' scores\non this second part of Assignment 3 under the column headed ``H3.''\n<P>\nThus, the total score on Assignment 3 is the sum of what was\nreceived on the first part (``H2,'' maximum of 3) and the second\npart (``H3,'' maximum of 11.5 rounded up).\n<p>\n\n<HR>\n<A NAME=23><b>Links: 1 point</b></A> <br>\nThis one didn't turn out the way it should, so everyone got 0 points.\nSo consider your score to really be on a 23 point scale.\n<HR>\n\n<b>Presentation: 3 points</b><br>\n<A NAME=\"A1\"> Full</A>\ncredit for completely modifying the original skeleton (eg. removing \"About\nQQ Skeletion\"), correct spelling, \ncareful proofreading, and having hypertext links\nthat were well integrated into the answers.  That is, you should not ask the\nuser to <A HREF=\"#A1\"> click here</A> or to click on on <A HREF=\"#A1\"> this</A>.\n\n<HR>\n\n<b>Name, e-mail address, major: 2 points</b>\nEveryone got these points, except for one or two students who\nforgot to modify the skeleton.\n\n<HR>\n\n<b>3 Finds: 3 points</b>\nPoints off for forgetting the links or forgetting the brief statement\nexplaining the find.\n\n<HR>\n\n<b>5 questions and answers: 3 points each, 15 points total</b><br>\nThe goal was to have interesting, well-focused questions and correct,\nspecific answers.\n(<i>Credit for simply submitting questions was <A HREF=#H2>given\npreviously</A>.</i>)\n\n\nOn many printouts I wrote:\n<UL>\n<LI>   \"vague\" -- wanders around the answer, isn't precise and focused,\n              includes information unrelated to the question.\n<LI>   \"doesn't answer the question\" -- I was surprised that many people\n              had questions and answers that didn't quite fit together.\n              For example, if the question is \"What is an X\" then the\n              answer shouldn't just be a link telling me where to find\n              the answer.\n<LI>   \"could answer before\" -- points off for anything that you could \n              easily find in a dictionary or in 5 minutes in the \n              library's reference room.\n</UL>\nI also looked for URLs that were reasonly closely related to the\nquestion.\n<P>\nThere is inevitably some subjectivity in this part of the scoring.\nIn general I was pretty quick to take off the first point and pretty\nslow to take off the second or third.  This is reflected in the \nclass average of 17 for the assignment: most people got 9's and 10's\n(out of 15) on the question and answer part.\n<HR>\n\n<b>2 questions related to major and course: -1 or -2 points if missed</b><br>\nOne or two points off if 2 questions weren't related to the course content\nand 2 related to your major.  \n(My shorthand for this was often \"-1 Major\".)\nAnd I didn't consider \"Where should\nI go to law school\" as related to anybody's major.\n\n<HR>\n<i>This information brought to you by\n<A HREF=\"/\">www.ics.uci.edu</A><br> Current as of\n5 March 1995\n<br>\nPlease send comments to ics1c@ics.uci.edu,\nincluding the URL to which your comments apply.\n</i>\n\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
