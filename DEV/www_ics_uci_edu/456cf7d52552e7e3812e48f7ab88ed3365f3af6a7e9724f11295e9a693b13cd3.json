For example,\nQSADRZQQSM could stand for LONGFELLOW. Notice that each L is\nreplaced by a Q and each O is replaced by an S, etc. The\ntraditional method of solving a cryptogram involves using a paper\nand pencil (and an eraser) to keep track of your substitutions.\nThis applet makes that process much easier in two ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When the \"Edit Cryptogram\" checkbox is not checked, then you\ncan type a character over another one to replace all instances of\nthat character with the new one you typed. If there were any other\ncharacters the same as the one you typed, they will be replaced\nwith the one you are replacing.</li>\n\n<li>The \"Solve\" button turns on <a href=\"algo.html\">an algorithm for\nautomatically solving cryptograms</a> which can often correctly\nguess most or all of the letters in the puzzle. The algorithm will\ncontinue improving its guesses until you press the \"Stop\" button.\nIf it is unable to finish the puzzle (for instance, because the\nsolution involves words not known to the algorithm) you can often\nuse its guesses as a starting point for your own solution.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"LEFT\"><small>User interface code by <a href= \n\"mailto:strottier@novell.com\">Steve\nTrottier</a></small></td>\n<td align=\"RIGHT\"><small>Automatic solver by <a href= \n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a></small></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
