VTML seems like it's much more a representation -- in a\n&gt;single file -- of a versioned resource.\n\nNo. Or rather, er, well, *yes*, but not only.\n\nVTML was designed so as to provide a representation in which the content of\nall versions of a resource can be represented as a single stream, *as well\nas* a set of disjoint streams (containing deltas), *as well as* any mixed\ncombination of the two that makes sense (thereby requesting that if a\nversion is externalized, then all its derived versions must be external as\nwell, and that merging versions must have all merged resources\ninternalized). Using your words, it is indeed a *representation* (i.e. a\ndata format, I assume), but it is not restricted to a single stream.\n\n&gt;I'm sorry for waving about a name (\"multipart/update\") without giving\n&gt;a binding for it, since it leaves too much to the imagination.\n\nIndeed. What's not clear to me is the actual reason for a \"multipart\" MIME\ntype.\nThis means, what do you exactly need to send in more than one version at a\ntime for? I see two possible explanations:\n\n1) you want to send in updates for different resources (e.g. a file AND its\nancillary images, all modified in the meantime), and want a single commit\nfor all of them -- and this is, I understand, *evil*.\n\n2) you want to send in several updates for the same resource: e.g. I check\nout a file for the weekend on my laptop, create locally several versions --\nfriday night, saturday afternoon just before the party, and sunday evening\nbecause I'm bored -- and check them back in first thing monday morning as a\nsingle connection, with the different parts representing the different\nversions that were created locally. -- This was considered an interesting\noption for VTML, and one of the main reasons for external deltas.\n\nIn the second case, provided that VTML deltas may be the body of each part\nof a multipart/update transmission, I think I am fine with the proposal.\n\nOr did you have something else in mind?\n\nFabio\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0081.html\">Fabio Vitali: \"Re: First cut at Functional Requirements document\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0079.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Version control in OpenText\"</a>\n<li> <b>In reply to:</b> <a href=\"0078.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: Re2: what's doable in Web version control\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
