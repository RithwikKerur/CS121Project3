Since the major point of\nversion-decorated URLs is to avoid requiring client awareness, leaving\nURLs opaque is logical.\n\nI believe what we are discussing, then, is a convention for attaching\nversion information to URLs, rather than a standard.  There are many\nsuch conventions -- hosts named \"www\", for example -- that make URLs\nreadable to humans, even if they do nothing for servers and clients.\nIt seems to me that if we do promote version-decorated URLs, we should\npropose a convention.  This was the thrust of the ,;/ discussion.\n\nThe whole topic of version-decorated URLs is, however, somewhat at odds\nwith Dan's talk of versioning with links.  Version-decorated URLs\npresuppose that the server has external version control over the web\ncontent.  The use of links, it appears, is an attempt to implement a\nversioning system _in HTML_.  Before I slight this approach, maybe Dan\ncould explain how those links get there: humans type them in? created\nby web authoring tools? automatically inserted by an external versioning\nsystem on document retrieval?\n\nChristopher\n----\nChristopher Seiwald     P3 Software             <a href=\"http://www.p3.com\">http://www.p3.com</a>\n<a href=\"mailto:seiwald@p3.com\">seiwald@p3.com</a>          f-f-f-fast SCM          1-510-865-8720\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0020.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0018.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe in reply to:</b> <a href=\"0002.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next in thread:</b> <a href=\"0020.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
