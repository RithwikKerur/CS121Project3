The drawings of 3-connected planar graphs are based on\nprimal-dual circle packings. Our drawings of outerplanar graphs are based on\na new algorithm that constructs strongly monotone drawings of trees which are\nalso convex. For irreducible trees, these drawings are strictly convex.\n\n<p>\nPaper by Stefan Felsner, Alexander Igamberdiev, Philipp Kindermann, Boris\nKlemz, Tamara Mchedlidze, Manfred Scheucher\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
