It's a two-player game of coining money.\nOn your turn you must coin a denomination that cannot be expressed\nas a sum (with repetitions) of previous denominations.  For instance,\nif nickels and dimes have already been coined, you may not coin\nquarters, since nickels and dimes suffice to make up 25 cents.\nThe players who coins \"1\" loses.  (Otherwise the first player would\nsay \"1\" and win at once.)  Of course all denominations must\nbe positive integers.  The game was invented by J. H. Conway, so\nnaturally you'll find a chapter on it in _Winning Ways._\n\nEvery game of Sylver Coinage must end, because ... well, I'll let you\nfigure out why.\n\nThe body of knowledge about Sylver Coinage consists of a few\nremarkable general theorems, some empirical results for certain\ngame positions, a lot of plausible conjectures (most of them\ndisproven), and some simple positions that have not been solved\nbut would very much like to be!  My paper provides a couple of\nnew (and minor) general results, and plenty of new empirical results.\n\n-:-\n    \"'PATAGEOMETRY: The study of those mathematical properties\n     that remain invariant under brain transplants.\"\n-- \nCol.

But it also provides a handy place to mention\nthe game \"Sylver Coinage\".\n\nMy musing began when Keith Ramsay made a nice distinction between\n*construcive* solutions to math questions, and *explicit* solutions. \nFor the most part, the latter are special cases of the former, whereby you\nactually *produce* a \"closed formula\" (whatever that may be in context).\nWhereas a constructive solution need only be a recipe whereby you can\nshow that you could *get* an explicit solution if you wanted to. It seems\nto me that the distinction between explicit and constructive is a good one.\n\nAnd in fact, as we've discussed before, constructive but non-explicit\nsolutions can often arise in some contexts, particularly finite games,\nwhich most mathematicians would call NON-constructive solutions, even though\nthey are automatically constructive solutions via finiteness, just not very\nvery helpful ones!  Classic cases are Hex, where the usual strategy-stealing\nmethod proves First has a winning strategy; and Chomp on a finite\nrectangle, where the corner-stealing argument does likewise.  \nThese proofs are constructive (in the technical logic sense), \nwhile being totally non-explicit.\n\nNow I want to ask about unbounded-length games.  Not *too* infinite,\nor we'll get into far too much of a mess, but not too *finite* either,\nor the usual constructive-by-finiteness proof will be easily extendible\nto the full game.  For example; consider Nim, but where First picks a bunch\nof pile numbers, and then Second gets to decide who makes the first play\nin the nimming part of the game.    Though this \"you cut I'll choose\"\nstarting mechanic is often a good way to nullify first-move advantage,\nit doesn't here, obviously.  One can easily prove (in the usual way) that\nSecond has a winning strategy; and this proof is constructive, even though\nthe length of the game is unbounded.  Because the game is bounded after\nthe first choice is made, it's just a one-quantifier extension of \nthe standard finite game, and so easily constructivised.\n\nSo that's not nearly unbounded enough.\n\nNow we come to \"Sylver Coinage\", a fascinating game discussed at great\nlength in the bible - \"Winning Ways\", by Berlekamp, Conway and Guy.\n\nIn turn, each player picks a natural number, which must not be a sum of\n(any positive number of) previous picks.  And it is illegal to pick 1;\nplural numbers only.   You lose if you can't make any pick.\n\nSo if First picks 2, or 3, then Second can pick the other, and now as\nall plurals are a sum of 2's and 3's, First can't move, and thus loses.\nSo First might pick 4, then second better not pick 2 or 3,  just as\nbefore; but neither should he pick 5, or First will pick 11, cutting\nout all numbers except 2,3 and 6,7, and whatever Second does now First\ncan match with its mate.\n\nIn general, we can play the game with any finite combination of starting\nnumbers already \"picked\" on the table.  The bible notes that the game is\nunsolved in general, even though some starting positions are known to be\nlosers, and some winners.  The bible also notes that a solution can be\nproven to exist, even though it may not be \"writable down\" in some sense.\n\nOne of the nice things about this game, is that it is not only unbounded,\nbut the first moves can be played such that it is *still* unbounded.\nIt is unboundedly unbounded, as they put it.  Not only that, but also\nthe first *unboundedly many* moves can be played so that it is *still* \nunbounded, so it is unboundedly unboundedly unbounded; and it's unboundedly \nthat as well, and unboundedly *that*, and so on unboundedly...\nin very ordinal-like fashion.\n\nNonetheless there *are* starting move sequences which *do* lead to\nbounded length tail games, such as the {4,5,11} above, and it was\nshown by Sylvester that eventually any choice sequence *must* lead\nto this situation, and that any actual play of the game *must* end.\nIt's in honor of Sylvester that they give it the name, and \"coinage\"\nbecause it is very neatly presented as a coinage denomination problem.\nSYLver Coinage is a neat witty mis-spelling of the type so common in\nthe bible; though I think they missed a trick by not calling it\n\"Sylver COYnage\", on the grounds that the players very commonly start\nby coyly dancing around picking very factorful numbers, before slowly\ngetting to grips with more nearly co-prime ones, whence it soon ends.\n\nSo the game is a play-finite one; just incredibly well unbounded.\n\nNow, we come to my constructivist query.  I'll put on the same simple\n\"you cut I'll choose\" starting condition, and see what we get.\n\nLet First choose any finite starting set of picks, for the start position;\nthen let Second choose who will be the first player to start the adding\nof new numbers alternately one at a time.  Then they play out the game\nin the standard manner.\n\nThis new game has an OBVIOUS stratgey-stealing proof that it is a win\nto player Second!  And yet, I believe this is a non-constructive proof,\nand one that cannot be simply made constructive, (unlike the unbounded\nNim above).    Not yet, anyway.\n\nNote that this \"cut-&amp;-choose\" version is not constructively unsolved\nmerely because of the unboundedness, nor even subsequently because of\nthe unexplicitness of the standard game - for just consider \"cut-&amp;-choose\"\n2-dimensional Chomp, which is also largely lacking explicit solutions:-\n\n(A) In this, the first player chooses a finite jagged rectangle as\n    the starting position, and Second chooses who'll be starter. I think\n    that this is easily constructively proved winnable by Second.\n\n(B) But \"cut-&amp;-choose\" Sylver Coinage is NOT constructively thus proved\n    to be a win to Second, I suspect.

If\na finite integer sequence  s  is a win for player  I, put the basic open\nneighborhood  U_s ={reals extending  s}  into  A; likewise if  s  breaks\nthe rules and it was  II  who first broke them.  So  A  is an open set,\nand the game an open game.  (Indeed, by Sylvester, the corresponding\nset  B  for  II  is  A's complement, i.e. the game is clopen).  Now we\nappeal to the theorem  \"for any set  X, open games on  X^w  are deter-\nmined\".\n\n    So a solution (winning strategy) exists... but that's that.\nRecall the well-known proof:  if  I  does not have a winning strategy\nthen for any move  x1  II has a reply  y1  such that from there on,\nI  doesn't have a w.s.  So for any  x2  there is a  y2  that does\nlikewise... and so on.  This strategy for  II  is a winning one: if\nx1,y1,x2,y2,...  were in  A  some initial segment would be  an  s,\nand from there on  I  would have had a w.s. -- namely, any strategy.\n\n    The non-constructiveness of this is clear.  (Indeed, the\ntheorem is equivalent to the full Axiom of Choice).\n\n@One of the nice things about this game, is that it is not only unbounded,\n@but the first moves can be played such that it is *still* unbounded.\n@It is unboundedly unbounded, as they put it.

(B)  seems to need\n\"for all m,  m  is a sum of elements from  s\"... but no, no quantifier\nis needed; it is enough that  s  contain  2 and 3  (and that no member\nof  s  is a sum of prior ones).

But it also provides a handy place to mention\n&gt; @the game \"Sylver Coinage\".\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    What??  You are not interested in bending Time to get an\n&gt; excluded-middle proof that Space does not exist, Bill?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; @My musing began when Keith Ramsay made a nice distinction between\n&gt; @*construcive* solutions to math questions, and *explicit* solutions. \n&gt; @For the most part, the latter are special cases of the former, whereby you\n&gt; @actually *produce* a \"closed formula\" (whatever that may be in context).\n&gt; @Whereas a constructive solution need only be a recipe whereby you can\n&gt; @show that you could *get* an explicit solution if you wanted to. It seems\n&gt; @to me that the distinction between explicit and constructive is a good one.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @And in fact, as we've discussed before, constructive but non-explicit\n&gt; @solutions can often arise in some contexts, particularly finite games,\n&gt; @which most mathematicians would call NON-constructive solutions, even though\n&gt; @they are automatically constructive solutions via finiteness, just not very\n&gt; @very helpful ones!  Classic cases are Hex, where the usual strategy-stealing\n&gt; @method proves First has a winning strategy; and Chomp on a finite\n&gt; @rectangle, where the corner-stealing argument does likewise.  \n&gt; @These proofs are constructive (in the technical logic sense), \n&gt; @while being totally non-explicit.\n\n  Yes, but even these easy starting cases contain some interesting subtle\npoints.  HA is Heyting arithmetic, the usual axioms of PA but formulated\nover intuitionistic logic.  HA does not prove all instances of Law of the\nExcluded Middle but it does prove the following universally quantified\ninstance of LEM:\n\n(*)   (for all x)(for all y) [ x=y or ~x=y].\n\n  The HA proof of (*) is by a double induction on x and y: prove (*) by\ninduction on x, where the inductive claims proved along the way are\nthemselves proved by induction on y.\n\n  I recall I once convinced myself that I could use Kripke models to show\nthat if we drop induction from HA, having just a theory of the\ndefinitions of + and *, and probably even add axioms saying we have a\ncommutative ring, over intuitionistic logic (*) is not provable.  Indeed\nthe x=0 specialization of (*) is not provable.\n\n  The proof Bill mentions of determinacy would have a base case of\nterminal positions.  I think over full HA considerations like (*) above\ngive a version of LEM for classifications of who won, but without\ninduction I expect there could be difficulties about LEM failing about\nwho wins.  Ie loosely speaking the previous corresponds to \"ambigous\nnumbers\" that can't be recognized as =0 or ~=0, and similarly there could\nbe \"ambiguous terminal positions\" about recognizing who has won.\n\n  Of course this isn't disagreeing with anyting Bill wrote, because\nconstructivism would normally be taken to include induction.  But if my\nsuggestion is correct, it is interesting that even at this early stage we\nrequire some strength of induction.  (Ie, as opposed to the classical\nversion, were (*) and related are trivial without induction).\n\n&gt; @Now I want to ask about unbounded-length games.  Not *too* infinite,\n&gt; @or we'll get into far too much of a mess, but not too *finite* either,\n&gt; @or the usual constructive-by-finiteness proof will be easily extendible\n&gt; @to the full game.  For example; consider Nim, but where First picks a bunch\n&gt; @of pile numbers, and then Second gets to decide who makes the first play\n&gt; @in the nimming part of the game.    Though this \"you cut I'll choose\"\n&gt; @starting mechanic is often a good way to nullify first-move advantage,\n&gt; @it doesn't here, obviously.  One can easily prove (in the usual way) that\n&gt; @Second has a winning strategy; and this proof is constructive, even though\n&gt; @the length of the game is unbounded.  Because the game is bounded after\n&gt; @the first choice is made, it's just a one-quantifier extension of \n&gt; @the standard finite game, and so easily constructivised.\n\n  Yes, again even the constructive proof is able to \"cheat\" and get\nlimited cases of LEM, ie each terminal postion is determined.\n\n&gt;    Seems to be the same situation as Chomp (choose-a-rectangle),\n&gt; or nxn Hex.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Or checkers...  Go...  You know. Trivial games.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; @So that's not nearly unbounded enough.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @\n&gt; @Now we come to \"Sylver Coinage\", a fascinating game discussed at great\n&gt; @length in the bible - \"Winning Ways\", by Berlekamp, Conway and Guy.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @In turn, each player picks a natural number, which must not be a sum of\n&gt; @(any positive number of) previous picks.  And it is illegal to pick 1;\n&gt; @plural numbers only.   You lose if you can't make any pick.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @So if First picks 2, or 3, then Second can pick the other, and now as\n&gt; @all plurals are a sum of 2's and 3's, First can't move, and thus loses.\n&gt; @So First might pick 4, then second better not pick 2 or 3,  just as\n&gt; @before; but neither should he pick 5, or First will pick 11, cutting\n&gt; @out all numbers except 2,3 and 6,7, and whatever Second does now First\n&gt; @can match with its mate.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @In general, we can play the game with any finite combination of starting\n&gt; @numbers already \"picked\" on the table.  The bible notes that the game is\n&gt; @unsolved in general, even though some starting positions are known to be\n&gt; @losers, and some winners.  The bible also notes that a solution can be\n&gt; @proven to exist, even though it may not be \"writable down\" in some sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;    Yes.   Think of the reals, w^w, as runs of Sylver Coinage.  If\n&gt; a finite integer sequence  s  is a win for player  I, put the basic open\n&gt; neighborhood  U_s ={reals extending  s}  into  A; likewise if  s  breaks\n&gt; the rules and it was  II  who first broke them.  So  A  is an open set,\n&gt; and the game an open game.  (Indeed, by Sylvester, the corresponding\n&gt; set  B  for  II  is  A's complement, i.e. the game is clopen).  Now we\n&gt; appeal to the theorem  \"for any set  X, open games on  X^w  are deter-\n&gt; mined\".\n&gt; \n&gt;    So a solution (winning strategy) exists... but that's that.\n&gt; Recall the well-known proof:  if  I  does not have a winning strategy\n&gt; then for any move  x1  II has a reply  y1  such that from there on,\n&gt; I  doesn't have a w.s.  So for any  x2  there is a  y2  that does\n&gt; likewise... and so on.  This strategy for  II  is a winning one: if\n&gt; x1,y1,x2,y2,...  were in  A  some initial segment would be  an  s,\n&gt; and from there on  I  would have had a w.s. -- namely, any strategy.\n&gt; \n&gt;    The non-constructiveness of this is clear.  (Indeed, the\n&gt; theorem is equivalent to the full Axiom of Choice).\n\n  Do you mean use AC to pick the  y1, y2 ... for II ?  I agree that if we\nare playing over some complex index set of moves choice may be needed to\npick the yi's.  The discussion just now was stated for games over w\n(omega), and this is the correct index set of plays for Bill's game.  Use\nthe natural well-ordering on w to pick the yi's.  Everything else in the\nproof seems definable also.  So I don't see why, for example this isn't a\ntheorem over classical logic of ZF.\n\n  On the other hand, there is an LEM issue about this proof that affects\nan intuitionistic attempt.  Namely the division into cases about whether\nor not I has a winning strategy:  ie if I wins, we are done, else\nconstruct a w.s. for II.  The statement being LEM'd here has a real\nexistential quantifier (there exists a w.s. for I), so LEM can't be\nreadily recovered as it can be for low complexity statements like (*).\n\n  So as I see it, there is a non-constructive aspect to this proof, but I\ndon't think it is related to AC.\n\n&gt; @One of the nice things about this game, is that it is not only unbounded,\n&gt; @but the first moves can be played such that it is *still* unbounded.\n&gt; @It is unboundedly unbounded, as they put it.  Not only that, but also\n&gt; @the first *unboundedly many* moves can be played so that it is *still* \n&gt; @unbounded, so it is unboundedly unboundedly unbounded; and it's unboundedly \n&gt; @that as well, and unboundedly *that*, and so on unboundedly...\n&gt; @in very ordinal-like fashion.\n\n  I haven't read Winning Ways, so I don't know if this is discussed, but\nBill's \"ordinal\" comment can be made very precise.  Below Bill mentions\nthat Sylvester proved that each play of the game is finite.  So\nconsider the tree of plays of the game (positions of the game being\nnodes of the tree), and impose a partial ordering on this corresponding\nto \"growing down\":  later positions of play are deemed \"smaller\". \nSylvester's finite play claim is equivalent to the claim this tree is\nwell-founded.  For such trees we can assign an ordinal rank to all nodes:\nterminal positions are 0, and non-terminal postions are the proper sup of\ntheir immediate successor position ranks (successors in play: predecessors\nin the tree ordering).  (Proper sup: the least ordinal strictly greater\nthan the successor ranks).\n\n  Then among such well-founded games, bounded games where the longest\nplay has exactly n moves (for n finite) are exactly those with opening\nposition having rank n.  Games are unbounded iff opeing rank is infinite.\nUnbounded games where each first move produces a bounded position are\nexactly those with opening rank omega.  Games having a maximum play of\nlength n leading to an unbounded position are rank w+n.  \"Unboundedly\nunbounded\" corresponds to rank &gt;= w*2.\n\n  In general any countable ordinal can be realized as the rank of the top\nof a well-founded tree.\n\n  From Bill's comments above, I would guess Sylver coinage has been\nclaimed to be of at least rank w^w.  It would be interesting to know the\nexact ordinal.\n\n&gt; @Nonetheless there *are* starting move sequences which *do* lead to\n&gt; @bounded length tail games, such as the {4,5,11} above, and it was\n&gt; @shown by Sylvester that eventually any choice sequence *must* lead\n&gt; @to this situation, and that any actual play of the game *must* end.\n&gt; @It's in honor of Sylvester that they give it the name, and \"coinage\"\n&gt; @because it is very neatly presented as a coinage denomination problem.\n&gt; @SYLver Coinage is a neat witty mis-spelling of the type so common in\n&gt; @the bible; though I think they missed a trick by not calling it\n&gt; @\"Sylver COYnage\", on the grounds that the players very commonly start\n&gt; @by coyly dancing around picking very factorful numbers, before slowly\n&gt; @getting to grips with more nearly co-prime ones, whence it soon ends.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @So the game is a play-finite one; just incredibly well unbounded.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @\n&gt; @Now, we come to my constructivist query.  I'll put on the same simple\n&gt; @\"you cut I'll choose\" starting condition, and see what we get.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @Let First choose any finite starting set of picks, for the start position;\n&gt; @then let Second choose who will be the first player to start the adding\n&gt; @of new numbers alternately one at a time.  Then they play out the game\n&gt; @in the standard manner.\n&gt; @\n&gt; @This new game has an OBVIOUS stratgey-stealing proof that it is a win\n&gt; @to player Second!  And yet, I believe this is a non-constructive proof,\n&gt; @and one that cannot be simply made constructive, (unlike the unbounded\n&gt; @Nim above).    Not yet, anyway.\n\n  Yes I agree with this.  Proving the strategy-stealing proof works seems\nto need LEM over whether the base games wins for I.  This is a complex\nenough statement that we don't seem to get LEM for free.\n\n  Of course, this LEM instance is just the statement of determinacy for\nthe base game.  But as discussed earlier that claim itself has LEM\ndifficulties.\n\n&gt;    Well, in the cut-and-choose version of any game  G,  I  never\n&gt; has a winning strategy  (no starting position of  G  has  w.s.'s for\n&gt; both sides!)...  so  cut-and-choose is determined  IFF  II  has a w.s.\n&gt; for it  IFF  G is determined for every starting position.  If our proof\n&gt; of the latter was non-constructive, then no wonder!...\n\n  Yes, Illias is making the same point.\n\n&gt; @Note that this \"cut-&amp;-choose\" version is not constructively unsolved\n&gt; @merely because of the unboundedness, nor even subsequently because of\n&gt; @the unexplicitness of the standard game - for just consider \"cut-&amp;-choose\"\n&gt; @2-dimensional Chomp, which is also largely lacking explicit solutions:-\n&gt; @\n&gt; @(A) In this, the first player chooses a finite jagged rectangle as\n&gt; @    the starting position, and Second chooses who'll be starter. I think\n&gt; @    that this is easily constructively proved winnable by Second.\n\n  Yes, even though these solutions are intractible to write out,\nintuitionism can handle them with inductions over base cases of provable\nLEM.  In these easy cases intuitionism can fake classical well enough,\nand the harder case of Sylver coinage it seems it can't.\n\n&gt; @(B) But \"cut-&amp;-choose\" Sylver Coinage is NOT constructively thus proved\n&gt; @    to be a win to Second, I suspect.  Just classically so.\n\n  I would suspect so too.  Unfortunately I can only conjecture this, not\nprove it.\n\n&gt; @Am I right in these last two comments?\n&gt; @Would some constructivist expert please tell me?\n\n  I am no expert though.  For the first claim about Chomp I am more\nconfident, ie the intuitionism can do it.  For the second claim about\nwhat intuitionism can't do, I am just agreeing that it sure looks that\nway, but to really say I better call in those experts too.\n\n&gt; @If so, it is intriguing that essentially the same proof can be regarded\n&gt; @constructively in one case but not in the other, even though both games\n&gt; @are finite but unbounded!\n\n  Yes.  I guess one difference is Chomp is easily provable to have rank w,\nso handling it only involves inductions up to omega.  Sylver coinage has\nrank well beyond omega, which contributes to the difficulties.  It forces\nus to consider LEM for more complicated statements where we don't get LEM\nfor free.\n\n&gt;    (A)  is clopen (boldface Delta-0-1), like before.  Actually,\n&gt; it is just  Delta-0-1 (recursive); that's easy.  (B)  seems to need\n&gt; \"for all m,  m  is a sum of elements from  s\"... but no, no quantifier\n&gt; is needed; it is enough that  s  contain  2 and 3  (and that no member\n&gt; of  s  is a sum of prior ones).  So  (B)  is recursive too.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Now general theory says that there exists a hyperarithmetical\n&gt; (Delta-1-1)  w.s. ...  to do better it takes specifics.  E.g.  (A)\n&gt; does have a recursive  w.s., due to the simple structure of its\n&gt; Delta-0-1  set.  Establishing a recursive w.s. for (B) would need,\n&gt; I imagine, some breakthrough -- something particular about the\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                        Ilias\n\n  Yes.\n\n  If the result is as we all seem to be conjecturing, we are asking for\nan independence result, what intuitionism can't prove.  I would guess\nthis would be difficult, needing to combine the strangeness of\nintuitionistic counterexamples to clasical theorems with the\ntechnicalities of Sylver coinage.\n\n  What sort of thing would be such a solution?  There are Kripke models,\nand some other methods I think Kleene gave, using recursion theory? \nAnother question is should an independence proof like this over classical\nlogic be acceptable, or must we have intuitionism in the meta-language\nalso?  I never pay much attention to this because I like classical logic\nand intuitionism is just a side topic for me, so if classical logic says\nso that's good enough for me.  But constructivist purists might not agree.\nCome to think of it, for simple independence results is there a\nconservative extension result saying it doesn't matter?\n\n  Anyway, this whole question of independence results and intuitionistic\ncounterexamples raises another pet peeve of mine.  Independence results\nhave a different meta-mathematical flavour from simple straightforward\nmathematical results.  And sure enough, in classical logic the effort to\nformalize solutions along these lines have uncovered a technical\ndifference reflecting this intuitive difference: the independence results\nmust be proven from a higher consistency strength theory, or must\nexplictly include a consistency premise.  I think this technical version\nin classical logic has brought a lot of clarity to such areas.\n\n  Now consider how similar issues are dealt with in the intuitionistic\nliterature.  So called intuitionistic counterexamples, which seem to be\nwaffling about what is being assumed and what level of machinery is being\nused.  \"If we could do this we could decide whether pi has 7 9's, so we\ncan't do this...\".  So when did you prove we can't decide pi has 7 9's? \nAhh we can't do this intuitionistcally?  So intuitionism is consistent? \nHow did you prove that, and in what level of language, since you never\nbothered to specify where you were working?  Note that Godel's theorem\napplies to HA.  Are they really trying to tell us intuitionism is\ninconsistent?\n\n  Anyway for me a good solution would be Kripke models or something like\nthat (not Brouwer's creative subject etc).  But I would be surprised if\nsuch a solution were easy.\n--\nDavid Libert     (<a href=\n\"mailto:ah170@freenet.carleton.ca\">ah170@freenet.carleton.ca</a>)\n1.

It forces\n||&gt; us to consider LEM for more complicated statements where we don't get LEM\n||&gt; for free.\n|\n|Yes, it seems so.  It's odd, though.  I'd have though induction over smallish\n|ordinals was fairly constructive, yet it seems not. \n\nI guess you see \"induction over ordinals\" as the primary working\ningredient here. Look more carefully.\n\n|Indeed, one *can* see\n|that there might well be trouble even with a simple double induction,\n|(i.e. over w^2).  If, to verify  A(n, x), you may go down to the A(n-1,  )'s\n|but may have to go enormously far, to  A(n-1, huge), well, one can see why \n|a constructivist may have a problem with that.   I guess.    Maybe.\n\nDon't think in terms of loose \"trouble\". Think of the specific steps\ninvolved. We can call a position in the game \"decided\" if one player\nor the other has a winning strategy in that position. We deduce for a\ngiven position P that if all the \"lesser\" positions Q&lt;P are decided\nthen P is also decided. How do we do that? Well, there is a set of\nallowed moves for the player whose turn it is, each leading to one of\nthe lesser positions. If one of those positions Q is a winner for that\nplayer, then of course P is as well, because the player can take that\nmove. On the other hand, if all of those positions are winners for the\nother player, then the other player has a winning strategy (apply a\nwinning strategy at whichever position comes next).\n\nThen (nonconstructively) we say, always either there exists a winning\nplay from P or there doesn't (and since each position which can be\nmoved to is decided, in that case the other player has a winning\nstrategy in each). Of course if there are finitely many allowed\nmoves, each which leads to a decided position, then P is also decided.\nClear enough? It's like the proof that all horses have the same color;\nthe whole problem lies with (certain cases of) the single inductive\nstep.\n\nThe original Sylver Coinage game is nevertheless decided; we have a\nwinning strategy, just not a very illuminating one. For the first\nplayer, picking 5 is a winning move. Then when the second player\npicks a number, the game is reduced to one with finitely many\nremaining numbers. By a strategy-stealing argument, we know that\nplayer 1 has a winning strategy, and needs only to do a finite search\nto implement it.\n\n...\n||&gt;   So called intuitionistic counterexamples, which seem to be   ...\n||&gt;  \"If we could do this we could decide whether pi has 7 9's, so we\n||&gt; can't do this...\".  So when did you prove we can't decide pi has 7 9's? \n|\n|The pi things are traditional Heyting, but not of the essence, I suspect.\n|The study of these counterexamples (\"fickle\" I think they're called) is\n|fairly unimpeachable, I imagine.  A better scenario would be perhaps to say. \n|\"If we could do this we could decide \n|                 whether an arbitrary TM will halt, so we can't do this...\"\n|That would make it much more gritty.     Even granitey.\n\nFinding a proof that the conjecture in question implies one of the\nstandard assumptions known to be outside of your \"modus operandi\" is\nmore to my taste than are the examples involving pi and so on. It's\nwhat mathematicians working nonconstructively often do when confronted\nwith statements which require this or that set-theoretical principle,\nafter all.\n\nOn the other hand, part of the point of the prosaic \"counterexamples\"\nseems to be to make the argument more concrete, which is typically\nperceived as making it \"grittier\". Your metaphor (the argument\nbecoming grittier as it becomes less concrete) seems a bit odd even to\nme. I think Brouwer would have objected to the idea that we need\nsomehow to do more than what is required to convey the intuition, in\norder to make it a more serious proof.\n\n||&gt;  So intuitionism is consistent? \n|\n|I'm sure that there are more technical approaches now, but in Heyting's\n|popularising book, intuitionism was more or less declared \"obviously\n|consistent\", because of its model in N, which was taken to be a \"mental\n|given\".\n|That's how I dimly recall it, though no doubt I'll get a rocket from Keith\n|for having completely misunderstood the whole point.  Anyway, OK, I don't\n|*disagree* with them; the same reasoning tells us that PA is *obviously*\n|consistent, which I'm quite happy with, on its somewhat informal level.\n\nThere are some cute remarks in Feferman's _In the Light of Logic_\nabout how Goedel skewered various of Hilbert's intuitions about how\nthese principles would relate to each other. One of Hilbert's guesses\nwas that the consistency of the law of excluded middle would be a much\nbigger deal than it was. The fact that HA is consistent and PA can be\nproven to be equiconsistent with HA has been used as a proof of the\nconsistency of PA. \n\nGoing the other direction is nothing, however. If you *drop* an\nassumption, *obviously* you are not going to introduce a contradiction\nwhere none existed before.\n\nNo, if you're going to worry about the consistency of intuitionism,\nyou are doing one of two things: either worry also about the\nconsistency of classical mathematics (and there's only so much to be\ndone to help you there), or be concerned because of the extensions to\nclassical mathematics which were made by intuitionists that contradict\nclassical mathematics. Brouwer had his free-choice sequences, for\nexample. That's a whole different story. The logicians have cooked up\n\"interpretations\" which show those are consistent if some more familiar\ntheoriest are consistent, although I have never been keenly interested\nin this bit of tidying up.\n\n||&gt; Anyway for me a good solution would be Kripke models or something like\n|that\n|\n|I keep hearing about these.  But there doesn't seem to be any reasonably\n|simple intro anywhere.  Like, I mean, something along the lines of a\n|Schaum series book!  I'd really like to learn about Kripke models - can \n|you make any likely suggestions?\n\nI haven't found much use for them. It's one of those things which one\nmight think would help you figure out intuitionism by leveraging off\none's prior familiarity with classical mathematics, but really doesn't\nseem to help much. It's more of a technical tool.\n\nThe definition should not be hard to find, and it's reasonably simple,\nalthough I'm not sure I remember the rules correctly. You have a\npartially ordered set F, and define a relationship |= between elements\nof F and statements in the first-order language of some structure. You\ndefine f|= p&amp;q when f|= p and f|= q. You define f|= p or q when f|= p\nor f|= q. You define f|= false never to hold. You define f|= p-&gt;q to\nhold if for every f'&gt;=f for which f'|=p, also f'|=q. Then you need to\nhave a domain of elements at each element of F in order to specify the\ninterpretation of the atomic statements and to define the meaning of\nf|=(Ax)P(x) and of f|=(Ex)P(x).\n\nKeith Ramsay\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:mathwft@math.canterbury.ac.nz\">mathwft@math.canterbury.ac.nz</a> (Bill Taylor)\n<b>Date:</b>           6 Mar 2000 06:11:05 GMT\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     sci.math\n<b>Subject:</b>        Re: Sylver Coinage - a constructivist conundrum?\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nOK then, time for me to show off my ignorance again.

After playing\n5.3^N and 7.3^N, you will be able to exclude every multiple of 3^N that \nis &gt;23.3^N; but either 2^m.3^(N-1).(2n+1) or 2^m.3^(N-1).(2n-1) will \nbe congruent to +3^(N-1) or -3^(N-1) mod 3^N, so by taking sums of these\nwith 5.3^N and 7.3^N, you will be able to exclude all sufficiently large\nmultiples of 3^(N-1), where `sufficiently large' depends only on m, n, and N.\nSo the p, ..., x, q that occur in the second group will be limited in size,\nand similar problems will occur in succeeding groups.\n\nThe Bible says (abridged):  ``Let g be the g.c.d. of the moves made.  Then\nit's not hard to see that only finitely many multiples of g are not expressible\nas sums of numbers already played.  So after at most this known number of \nmoves the g.c.d. must be reduced.''\n\nSo we may associate with each position of Sylver Coinage an ordered pair\n(g, N), where g is the g.c.d. of the moves made, and N is the number of\ninexpressible multiples of g.  Any move from this position must either be\n\n        an inexpressible multiple of g, taking us to (g, M), where M &lt; N\n\n                              or\n\n        an x not a multiple of g, taking us to (g', P), for some P,\n              where g'=gcd(g,x) is a proper divisor of g.\n\nIn either case, the ordered pair strictly decreases (in lexicographic order).\nThis gives the bound of w^2.\n\nIn your example, the sequence of g.c.d.s is\n\n         2^m.3^N.(2n+1), 2^m.3^N, 2^(m-1).3^N, ..., 2.3^N, 3^N\n\nin the first group, but when you start the second group the g.c.d. will drop\nalmost immediately to\n\n         3^(N-1),\n\ncausing trouble.\n-- \nDavid Moews                                       <a href= \n\"mailto:dmoews@xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu\">dmoews@xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu</a>\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:colonel@monmouth.com\">colonel@monmouth.com</a> (He Comes As No Surprise)\n<b>Date:</b>           8 Mar 2000 17:14:28 -0500\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     sci.math\n<b>Subject:</b>        Re: Sylver Coinage - a constructivist conundrum?\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nIn &lt;<a href=\n\"mailto:20000305215649.05178.00000487@nso-cv.aol.com\">20000305215649.05178.00000487@nso-cv.aol.com</a>&gt;, <a\nhref=\"mailto:kramsay@aol.mangled\">kramsay@aol.mangled</a> wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; |In turn, each player picks a natural number, which must not be a sum of\n&gt; |(any positive number of) previous picks.

For example, W.W. defines an\nend-position as a position with g=1 in which every legal move u less\nthan t excludes t, and a quiet end-position as the same except that\nu excludes t using just one instance of u.

(This\ndoes not actually involve the game of Sylver Coinage; it is only\nimportant in characterizing it.)\n\nHutchings's Theorem: If g(m,n)=1 and t(m,n)&gt;1, then {m,n} is an ender\n(and therefore \"N\").\n\nNow here are the unproved results:\n\nProposition X:  Let S and T be initial segments of the same ascending\narithmetic progression with g=1.

It is easy to replace the condition that m and n are\ngreater than 3 with the weaker condition of Hutchings's Theorem.\nTechnically even {2,3} (where t=1) is a quiet ender--the only\nender that is \"P\".\n\n-:-\n\t\"'PATAGEOMETRY: The study of those mathematical properties\n\t that remain invariant under brain transplants.\"\n-- \nCol.

If S is an ender, then S is a quiet ender.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No progress yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I'll try to adapt Roberts's ideas.\n\nRoberts's formula has inspired me to reformulate Proposition Y:\n\n\tProposition Y:  Let S = {a[0], a[1], ... , a[s]} be an increasing\n\tarithmetic progression of numbers greater than 3.  If s divides\n\ta[0]-2, then S is a quiet ender; otherwise S is not an ender.\n\nThis is more specific and should be easier to prove.\n\n-:-\n\tWhen by judgement one means knowing how something comes to be\n\twhat it is, the judgement must appear as re-constructing the\n\tidentical universe of the difference.  Then every model\n\tincludes the measure of its own difference.  No state of\n\tequilibrium is empowered to remain identical, or to compel the\n\tindividual to alter (and integrate with it).  The identical is\n\tequal to itself, since it is different.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t--Franco Spisani (1975)\n-- \nCol. G. L.
