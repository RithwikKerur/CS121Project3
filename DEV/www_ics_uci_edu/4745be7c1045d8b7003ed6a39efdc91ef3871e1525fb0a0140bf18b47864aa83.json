Our copy of Wired still lay unread in our growing \"read\nsometime\" pile, though we had noticed the article on Xanadu, Nelson's\nhypertext project.  The email left us reeling:</P>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nThe June issue of WIRED magazine contains an extremely nasty  and\nmean-spirited article entitled \"The Curse of Xanadu,\"  by Gary Wolf, which\npurports to be the obituary of Project Xanadu.   \n\nThe article is an affront to the alumni and veterans of the Xanadu project,\nsome fifty of us over the years, contriving to make our endeavors look\nimpossible and asinine ...\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P>Some background will help put this message in perspective.  While most\nfolks credit Vannevar Bush with the first description of\nhypertext-like capability in an article titled, \"As We May Think,\"\npublished in 1945, the system he described (which he called Memex) was\nbased on microfilm.  In 1960, Ted Nelson invented computer-based\nhypertext for a term project while a graduate student at Harvard, and\nthereafter became increasingly consumed with his vision of global\nhypertext, which he called the Xanadu system.  He coined the term\n\"hypertext\" and presented a paper on \"zippered lists,\" a key algorithm\nin his Xanadu system, at a national conference of the Association for\nComputing Machinery in 1965.</P>\n\n<P>Given the dramatic growth of the World Wide Web (which still lacks\nmany key features of the Xanadu system), you would think that Nelson\nwould be accorded the same respect as other scientists and engineers\nwhose work has dramatically entered our lives.  However, due to early\nhigh expectations placed onto the Xanadu project, combined with a\nseries of wrenchingly tragic setbacks, the Xanadu system is still\nstruggling to reach market, decades after its conception.</P>\n\n<P>Even though Nelson is not one to mince words, the intensity of his\nemail message still took us by surprise.  Digging out our Wired, we\nread through the offending article, and had to agree: the article is\nindeed a carefully crafted slam of Nelson and Xanadu (the article can\nbe accessed via the WWW at\n<A HREF=\"http://www.hotwired.com/wired/3.06/features/xanadu.html\">\nhttp://www.hotwired.com/wired/3.06/features/xanadu.html</a>).\nFeeling that the mission of KUCI is to give marginalized voices a powerful\noutlet, we approached Nelson about appearing on the Cyberspace Report.\nA mere week after receiving his stunning email, Ted Nelson was our\nfeatured guest.  Here are some excerpts from the interview.</P>\n\n<P><B>Cyberspace Report:</B> What inspiration led you to develop hypertext?</P>\n\n<P><B>Ted Nelson:</B> Well I was always, as a kid, into writing and reading\nand literature and movies basically, like a lot of people, and I had\ndone a great deal of writing as a youth, and re-writing, and the\nintricacy of taking ideas and sentences and trying to arrange them\ninto coherent, sensible, structures of thought struck me as a\nparticularly intricate and complex task, and I particularly minded\nhaving to take thoughts which were not intrinsically sequential and\nsomehow put them in a row because print as it appears on the paper, or\nin handwriting, is sequential.  There was always something wrong with\nthat because you were trying to take these thoughts which had a\nstructure, shall we say, a spatial structure all their own, and put\nthem into linear form.  Then the reader had to take this linear\nstructure and recompose his or her picture of the overall content,\nonce again placed in this nonsequential structure.  You had two it\nseemed -- and now I'm reconstructing because I don't know how\nexplicitly I thought this out as a youth -- you had to take these two\nadditional steps of deconstructing some thoughts into linear sequence,\nand then reconstructing them.  Why couldn't that all be bypassed by\nhaving a nonsequential structure of thought which you presented\ndirectly?  That was the hypothesis -- well the hyperthesis really --\nof hypertext, that you could save both the writer's time and the\nreader's time and effort in putting together and understanding what\nwas being presented.</P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> What was your inspiration for the Xanadu system itself?</P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> Well basically Xanadu has always been coextensive with my whole\nparadigm -- I gave a talk on this last night at Xerox PARC -- which\nwas that you want to be able to keep track of your own creative output\nbeing able to see the differences between my own versions and say, gee\nif I move this from the beginning to the middle, and lets try it that\nway, but then try moving the middle to the beginning in another\nversion, how does it come out each way?  So on the one hand, you want\nas a writer or creative constructor of anything, those tools which\nwill most contribute to your understanding of the consequences of your\nown design decisions.  On the other hand, for a new publishing system\nof the future, and it seemed manifest to me in 1960 that we would be\nreading and writing on computer screens that were interactive and all\nthis would be fed by a vast feeder network of digital digitalia around\nthe world, since we're going to be publishing in a system of this\nkind, what would be the reward structure, what would be the document\nstructure, and what would be the most beneficial extension of\nliterature as we knew it.  To me literature is the great ideal here,\nnot some engineer's notion of information retrieval.  The engineers\nseem to have the notion that you can take the documents that are\nwritten and dip them in some sort of technical acid and the facts will\nfall to the bottom and then these facts will roll into their\nappropriate slots.  This is not so.  Writing is the way it is because\nevery word generally has some kind of meaning.  It's finding these\nmeanings and making them most useful to me that seems the great\nproblem.  So the issue is what will be the extension of literature\ninto the great realm of interactive, multi-dimensional, many-threaded\npresentational forms.  So Xanadu basically has been my name for an\nevolving but essentially centrally the same system for the supply and\npresentation of material with two basic relationships: what we would\ncall the link, which is an unchanging connection between objects, or\nparts which are different, and the transclusion, which is a maintained\nconnection between parts which are the same.</P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> It sounds like the Xanadu system, many many years ago\nsolved a lot of the really pertinent problems that are just only\nstarting to surface in the World Wide Web today.  But yet the WWW has\nmanaged to become by now the dominant hypertext paradigm.  For the\nvast majority of people in the United States right now when you say\nhypertext they think of Netscape or Mosaic and that is their notion of\nhypertext.  Now that the WWW is so dominant, how does Xanadu have to\nchange, to modify itself to fit into the new reality of a WWW world?</P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> That's a good question, I'm still muddling with it.\nFirst of all, I think the WWW was a brilliant simplification.  As I\nunderstand it, and maybe I have this wrong, but Tim Berners-Lee came\nand we had lunch, in, oh I guess it was 1989, 90, something like that,\nin Sausalito, and I really liked the guy, and he'd done this very\nsimple thing, and it sounded too trivial to me {laughs} but he\ncertainly was a nice fellow and I expected to keep in touch with him,\nalthough I am a very bad correspondent, and the next thing I knew\nsuddenly the thing had caught on.  And what it turns out to be is\nsimply an extension of file transfer protocol, in other words it's\nsaying you can anonymously go in and dip in and take out this file and\nhere is a proposed way to look at it.  This is called HTML.  You have\nto undestand the HTML/SGML kind of format where you've got all these\nwarty little knobs and boogers in it that are formatting codes -- this\nis absolutely contrary to the Xanadu idea that you have clean data\nundefiled.  However, it works, it's very simple, and you can always\ntake those things out, so that's OK.  But all it is is FTP with\nlipstick so that you can look at these things and the jump addresses\nare hidden and the formats and you have paragraph levels and stuff and\nit's basically what people needed and frankly I think it's much better\nthan word processing.  I'm really happy now that I'm planning to\nswitch from Microsoft Word to HTML just because there's no need not\nto.  It's a perfectly good format, and it makes everything simpler to\nbrowse in.</P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> You've obviously been at one point a visionary...</P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> At one point?  When did that end? </P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> Even now with the WWW your ideas are taking on sort of a\nnew reality in some way shape and form...</P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> Or seemingly more real to some people.</P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> If some people who have what seem like visionary ideas\nright now, how would you encourage them to go about turning them into\nreality based on your own experiences?</P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> What would I recommend to a young visionary today?\n{laughter} Very straightforward, learn to deal with short term goals\nand not delegate. I trusted them {laughter} famous last words.  These\nare people I still love and respect, but if I had been able to hold it\ntogether and {pause} not try to overstretch and overgrab and managed\nshort term goals better, things would have been very different.  But\nagain I took a big goal as a single unit and then I turned it over to\nothers who took it as a single unit and made it a bigger goal and thus\npostponed dealing with a well-defined situation.</P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> Well, certainly the Xanadu system has had sort of a\ncheckered, and some would say, tragic history...</P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> Well I would agree with the tragic, but the past tense I\ndon't agree with.  We're having a meeting right now as to how best to\nput the system on the web because it's still working better than it\nwas in 1992, and as far as I know it can be finished.</P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> There was a recent article in Wired magazine which took\na very critical view of the whole Xanadu project to date.  I know I've\nreceived email from you where you were saying that you thought the\narticle was almost libelous...</P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> Not almost, definitely. </P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> OK, definitely libelous.  Would you care to comment\nabout your objections to the Wired article, which many of our\nlisteners probably have access to? </P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> Sure.  Well it comes down to a great deal to personal\nviewpoint and personal integrity.  People see the world differently\nand the reporter, whose name is Gary Wolf, makes his biases extremely\nclear in the article, but they were by no means clear when he so\ncharmingly inveigled his way into my confidence.  Now of course I've\ngenerally taken the point of view that posterity would like what I did\nand so I've trusted journalists as sort of ambassadors from posterity\nand this has been a mistake in general but, ahem, Mr. Wolf did not\nmake his biases in any way evident when we saw each other.  It turns\nout that the three things he most dislikes as far as I can tell are\nidealism, untidyness, and immodesty, all three of which he found in\nprofusion in the Xanadu project.  For myself, I have always hated\nthings in people, well the people who I've regarded as shallow,\nconventional, pompous, and smug.  So each of us hit the jackpot in the\nother.  But as I say, he got to strike first, in this extremely\nscurrilous and nasty piece. </P>\n\n<P>He emailed me recently saying, gee I seem to have overlooked all the\npositive statements, which is interesting because in my eight or so\nreadings of the article I did not find one positive statement which\nwas not immediately taken back by sarcasm or innuendo.  What I object\nto as actually libelous in the piece of course has nothing to do --\nwell of course it has something to do with it -- but is not directly a\nmatter of its tone or its nastyness.  Libel consists of damaging,\nfalse statements which are being promulgated either maliciously or\nnegligently.  Now as a reporter your standards for negligence may be\nrather slippery but this man had definite access to a great deal of\ninformation and I believe he was extremely, shall we say, disingenuous\nin the use of that information and how he passed it on.  For example\nhe very amusingly talks about us as if we are blundering hobbyists and\nsays that computer scientists would not have agreed with us, therefore\naccording to Wolf we were not computer scientists, right.  He says of\nRoger Gregory, my good friend whom he impugned and was much nastier to\nthan me, he says Roger Gregory was not an elite researcher or computer\nscientist.  Yet a few paragraphs later he mentions that Roger had\ndeveloped a new addressing scheme based on transfinite arithmetic.\nNow I do not know what Mr. Wolf means by computer science, but within\nmy world, someone who invents an addressing scheme based on\ntransfinite arithmetic is not stamp collecting. That's computer\nscience, or it was that week, and this is serious stuff.  By elite\nresearcher I suppose he means \"annointed researcher\" such having PhD's\nor working at Xerox PARC or being licensed to kiss the feet of\nso-and-so.  But we basically, on our own, were doing important, strong\nwork at the forefront and Mr. Wolf has made a point of trashing us and\nignoring any indication we were not a bunch of deranged hobbyists.\nFor example, he does not mention the contributions of Eric Drexler to\nthe team precisely, I think, because eveyone agrees that Eric Drexler\nis a scientist, and therefore obviously doesn't fit into Mr. Wolf's\nthesis.</P>\n\n<P><B>CR:</B> Do you have any final, last words for our audience? </P>\n\n<P><B>TN:</B> No, but just thank you very much for listening Orange \nCounty, and I'm with you in spirit and good luck with the bonds. </P>\n\n<P>A complete, digital copy of this interview can be accessed from the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/csr/cyber.html\">\nCyberspace Report WWW page</a>.</P>\n\n<P>Copyright &copy 1996, Jim Whitehead</P>", "encoding": "ascii"}
