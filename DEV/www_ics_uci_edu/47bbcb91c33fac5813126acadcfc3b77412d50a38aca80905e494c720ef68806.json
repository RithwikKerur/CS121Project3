If we do not provide support for security in the standard\n&gt;so that different clients can speak a generic security language we will end\n&gt;up with a versioning protocol that may be implemented but will be hidden\n&gt;behind a proprietary security wall. Security is ugly but we can not avoid\n&gt;it. We can not punt it.\n\nI agree that security is very important for versioning, and also for\ndistributed authoring.  There are many situations where you would not want\nto send unencrypted files over the wire.\n\nWhat I would like is a better understanding of whether existing HTTP\nsecurity protocols can be used (e.g., SHTTP, MD5, certificates), or whether\nwe need to call for something new.  If we go to the HTTP working group and\nsay \"we need a security protocol to support distributed authoring,\" their\nfirst questions will be a) exactly what distributed functionality depends\non security capability, and b) in what way do the existing security\nmechanisms not support the functionality decribed in the answer to a).\n\nAlso, I think we need to be very careful in our terminology to separate\n\"access control\" from \"security.\"  These two areas, while somewhat related,\nare not synonymous.\n\nAccess control is definitely needed to support versioning.  The question in\nmy mind is whether we only need locking, or whether more fine-grain control\nover access control is needed.  I know we can do versioning with only\nlocking -- what more can be done with full-featured access control\nfunctionality?\n\n- Jim Whitehead &lt;<a href=\"mailto:ejw@ics.uci.edu\">ejw@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0117.html\">David G.
