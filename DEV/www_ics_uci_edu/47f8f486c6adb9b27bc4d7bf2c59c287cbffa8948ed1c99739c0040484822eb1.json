The \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ietf.org/\">\nInternet Engineering Task Force (ITEF)</a>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/\"> \nWorld Wide Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WEBDAV) Working Group</a>\nis developing interoperability specifications for how to perform remote \nauthoring and versioning of web content. IRUS was pleased to co-sponsor a \ntwo-day W3C symposium, enabling IRUS sponsors to participate in this \nlimited-attendance event. IRUS also sponsored a two-day WebDAV working group \nmeeting, held at UC Irvine.\n\n<p>\n\n<b>International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)</b>\n<br>\n\nIRUS was pleased to have provided support for ICSE, the premier\ninternational conference on the topic of software engineering. ICSE is \na week long event sponsored by \n<A HREF=\"http://www.acm.org/\"> ACM<a>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.acm.org/sigsoft/\"> SIGSOFT</a>\nand \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ieee.org/\"> IEEE</a>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.computer.org/\"> Computer Society</a>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.tcse.org/\"> TCSE,</a> \nfeaturing prestigious keynotes, a technical program, a\ndoctoral symposium, research demonstrations, commercial exhibitions, \nworkshops, and tutorials.  IRUS has supported ICSE 16, the ICSE 16 \nSoftware Engineering/Human Computer Interaction Workshop, and \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icse97/\">\nICSE 97 (ICSE 19).</a>\n\n<p>\n\n<b>Human Computer Interaction (HCI) Consortium</b>\n<br>\n\nThis ten year old consortium, centered at the University of Colorado,\nBoulder, sponsors an annual basic research meeting. Member organizations, \nwhich are drawn from universities and commercial and government research \nlabs, include Apple, Bellcore, NYNEX, SunSoft, Tektronix, US West, \nXerox PARC, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Colorado, Georgia Tech, \nMIT, Virginia Tech, and UC Irvine. \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIRUS,</a> \nthe UCI \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science Department,</a> \nand the UCI \n<A HREF=\"http://www.crito.uci.edu/\">\nCenter for Research on Information Technology and Organizations (CRITO)</a> \nshare the UCI membership. \n\n<p>\n\n<b>Software Engineering Tools and Technology (SETT) Tools Fair</b>\n<br>\n\nThis one day IRUS event featured offerings from popular vendors and\navant garde solutions from research labs. Attendees experienced leading \nproducts and state-of-the-art technologies, received valuable advice \nfrom exhibitors, learned about key products and solutions, evaluate \nsoftware based on hands on tool demonstrations, and gained educational \nadvantages by seeing new technologies in action.\n\n<p>\n\n<b> COCOMO 2.0</b>\n<br>\nIRUS is also involved with the\n<A HREF=\"http://sunset.usc.edu/COCOMOII/Cocomo.html\">COCOMO 2.0\nproject</A>,\na joint effort with the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.usc.edu\">\nUniversity of Southern California's</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://sunset.usc.edu/index.html\">\nCenter for Software Engineering (USC/CSE)</A>.\n\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">Back to the IRUS home page</A>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n \n</BODY></HTML>\n \n \n", "encoding": "ascii"}
