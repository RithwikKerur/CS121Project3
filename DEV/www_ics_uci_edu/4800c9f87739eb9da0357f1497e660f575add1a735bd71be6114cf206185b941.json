We\ncount the number of lakes and connected land masses formed and destroyed\nin this rainstorm to obtain the result.\n<P>\nFor each local minimum there will be one lake formed.\nFor each saddle there will either be two lakes joined or a single lake\ndoubling back on itself and disconnecting one land mass from another\n(let J and D denote the number of times these events happen respectively).\nFor each peak a land mass will be eliminated.\nInitially there is one land mass, and in the final sitation there is one global lake.\nThus we have 1+D-F=0 and 0+V-J=1.\nCombining these two equations with the fact that D+J=E yields the result.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nOne can either view the rainfall as (unnaturally) causing the global water levels\nto always be at the same height, so that two lakes reach a saddle at the same time;\nor one can take a more realistic viewpoint and say that the rainfall may\nvary arbitrarily over the globe, but when one lake reaches a saddle the water will\nspill over it (and the lake will not rise) until the lake on the other\nside of the saddle reaches the same height.\n<P>\nThis proof is close to self-dual, the biggest asymmetry being in the\ndefinition of the height function.\nAs usual, the Jordan curve theorem is involved, in the fact that a lake\ndoubling back on itself creates an island. The principle of classifying the singular points (peaks, saddles, and valleys) for a height function defined on a surface is the main idea behind Morse theory, but this proof dates back much earlier than Morse, to an 1863 publication of M&ouml;bius.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
