Efficient algorithm for finding\nseparators for a graph class often leads to efficient divide-and-conquer\nalgorithms for different problems on the graph class. A separator theorem\ntypically provides worst-case guarantees on the balance of the parts and on\nthe size of their shared boundary. Separator theorems have been found for\nplanar graphs, bounded-genus graphs, and minor-free graphs. For a\ntriangulated planar graph with n vertices, it is known that there exists a\ncycle of size O(sqrt(n)) that splits the graph in roughly equal sizes. In\nthis talk we discuss some recent results on small separators for planar\ngraphs.\n\n<p>\nFirst we show a simple proof for the existence of a planar separator\nexploiting simple geometry, probability theory and the well-known\ncircle-packing theorem on planar graphs. This result can be also extended to\nreprove the existence of separators in graphs with k-ply intersection\nrepresentation of d-dimentional balls, and the k-nearest neighbor graphs on a\nset of d-dimensional points. Finally we also describe a recent algorithm to\nconstruct a cycle separator with sqrt(8m) edges for a planar graph containing\nm edges.\n\n<p>\n(This talk is based on two recent papers: one is an arxiv paper by Sariel\nHar-Peled, and the other is an ALENEX 2013 paper by Eli Fox-Epstein, Shay\nMozes, Phitchaya Mangpo Phothilimthana, and Christian Sommer.)\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
