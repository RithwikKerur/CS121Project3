If the\nmessages are not delivered in the order they were sent (for example\nwhen the communica- tion delay time is arbitrary) then two players\nrequire at least <i>n</i>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1 messages. In an\nasynchronous network, where the messages are delivered in the order\nthey were sent, 0.88<i>n</i> messages suffice. In a synchronous\n0.586<i>n</i> messages suffice and 0.536<i>n</i> messages are\nrequired in the worst case. We exhibit a simple randomized\nalgorithm with expected worst-case cost of 0.5<i>n</i> messages,\nand a deterministic algorithm for <i>k</i>&nbsp;<u>&gt;</u>&nbsp;2\nplayers with a cost well below <i>n</i> for all <i>\nk</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;o(sqrt&nbsp;<i>n</i>). The graph-theoretic\nframework we formulated for expressing and analyzing algorithms for\nthis problem may be of independent interest.</p>\n\n<p>(From a SODA '98 paper by Buhrman et al.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
