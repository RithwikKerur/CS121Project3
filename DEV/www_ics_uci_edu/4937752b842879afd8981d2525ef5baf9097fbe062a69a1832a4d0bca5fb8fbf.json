Find a lexicographic breadth first search ordering for G, starting\nfrom vertex a.\n\n(2) Is the graph G from problem 1 a chordal graph? Why or why not?\n\n(3) Describe an ordering for the vertices of G such that the greedy\ncoloring algorithm finds the smallest possible number of colors for G,\nand another ordering for the vertices of G such that the greedy\nalgorithm uses too many colors.\n\n(4) Let H be the graph with five vertices a, b, c, d, e, and seven edges\nab, ac, bc, bd, cd, ce, and de. Find a set of five intervals\nrepresenting H as an interval graph.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
