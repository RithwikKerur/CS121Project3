(There's a hot debate about whether this is a historically sound interpretation, but we'll set this aside here.) And courts have also read the First Amendment as applying to executive agencies and the federal courts as well as Congress.<P>\r\n But absent really exceptional circumstances, the First and Fourteenth Amendments do *not* constrain private entities: Private employees, private university, private dinner party hosts, private businesses.<P>\r\n There can be nothing unconstitutional about a private list moderator rejecting your posting to a discussion list, Prodigy editing out your dirty words, or a service provider refusing to let its users put up Nazi-themed Web pages. Only &quot;state action&quot; (which actually includes all government action, including federal action) implicates the constitutional protections.<P>\r\n What if the speech restrictions are imposed by a private actor who is in some way related to the government - for instance, subsidized or employed by a government agency? The rule is that &quot;state action&quot; is present only when the speech restriction is dictated or influenced by the government. Thus,<P>\r\n<BLOCKQUOTE> - GOVERNMENT FUNDING ISN'T ENOUGH: If a private employer restricts what his employees may e-mail, there's no state action, even if the employer gets all its business from government contracts.<P>\r\n - GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP OF THE COMPUTER ISN'T ENOUGH: If a public university lets someone set up a moderated discussion list on its computer, and the moderator excludes certain messages, there's no state action, even though the list is on a public computer.<P>\r\n - GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT OF THE MODERATOR ISN'T ENOUGH: The fact that a list moderator is employed by the government is not by itself enough: If a public university lets a faculty member set up a moderated discussion list, there's almost certainly no state action, so long as the faculty member's decisions are his own and not dictated by the government.<P>\r\n - GOVERNMENT DICTATION OF SPEECH RESTRICTION IS ENOUGH: But if a public entity has an employee set up a moderated list, and *instructs* the employee to reject any, say, profane or bigoted messages, there is state action (though conceivably, as we'll see below, the government's action might still be constitutional).<P></BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n Qualification: This relates only to rights under the U.S. Constitution. Some state constitutions and state statutes do provide protection against some private speech restrictions. A California law, for instance, generally bans many restrictions imposed on students by private universities.<P>\r\n<BR>authors:\r\n<TABLE CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>\r\n<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Larry Lessig</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>David Post</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Eugene Volokh</TD></TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<BR>\r\n<CENTER>\r\n<HR SIZE=\"3\" WIDTH=\"65%\">\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"../csl_lessons.html\">Back to Lesson Index</A>\r\n</CENTER>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\">\r\nCopyright \u00a9 1999 Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc.
