In all three areas,\nthere are problems that can be solved effectively using greedy\nalgorithms, and (as we will show in this talk) many of these problems\nhave an underlying combinatorial structure that can be exploited to\nspeed up the runtime of the greedy algorithms. We focus on the use of a\nspecific technique and its application across all three fields: the\nnearest-neighbor chain algorithm. This technique originated in the\ncontext of speeding up hierarchical clustering algorithms in the 80s,\nand a slight variation was recently used to the same effect in the\ncontext of some stable matching problems. Independently, Robert Preis\ndeveloped a linear-time two-approximation algorithm for the maximum\nweighted matching problem using similar ideas. In this talk, we work\ntoward unifying all these algorithms into a single framework, and extend\nthe techniques to other problems such as maximum independent set and set\ncover.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Pedro Matias.)</p>\n\n</body></html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
