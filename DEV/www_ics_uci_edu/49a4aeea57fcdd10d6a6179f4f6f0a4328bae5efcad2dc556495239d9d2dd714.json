We prove a simulation lemma showing\nthat a large class of PRAM algorithms can be e\u000eciently\nsimulated via MapReduce. The strength of MapReduce,\nhowever, lies in the fact that it uses both sequential and\nparallel computation. We demonstrate how algorithms\ncan take advantage of this fact to compute an MST of a\ndense graph in only two rounds, as opposed to Omega(log(n))\nrounds needed in the standard PRAM model. We show\nhow to evaluate a wide class of functions using the\nMapReduce framework. We conclude by applying this\nresult to show how to compute some basic algorithmic\nproblems such as undirected s-t connectivity in the\nMapReduce framework.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
