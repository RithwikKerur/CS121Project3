Current sequencing of an individual&#8217;s genome is done by extracting short segments of DNA, randomly sampling those segments and then assembling the hundreds of millions, or even hundreds of billions, of pieces into a whole genome, which remains a costly undertaking. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, which enable the rapid generation of billions of bases of genes at relatively low cost, pose a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. \n</p>\n<p>\n&#8220;Although a number of computational tools have been developed to address this problem, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes,&#8221; says Xie. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe primary goal of his NIH-funded research is to develop computational algorithms and open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of NGS analysis tools and expand the accessibility of those tools to previously understudied regions. This will create a new way of mapping the sequencing to the reference genome, identifying all mapping locations instead of one or only a few. That will be followed by a machine-learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads.\n</p>\n<p>\nUCI computer scientists on the project are collaborating with biologists developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems, including Timothy Osborne of Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute, Kyoko Yokomori of the UCI School of Medicine and Ken Cho of UCI&#8217;s School of Biological Sciences. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe UCI team&#8217;s work to reduce the cost and improve the accuracy of sequencing ultimately may make it possible to create an individual patient&#8217;s genome as part of a routine diagnostic procedure. \n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<p><b><a name=\"winter_2013_meenakshisundaram_mukherjee_receive_best_paper_award_at_icvgip_2012\"></a>Meenakshisundaram, Mukherjee receive best paper award at ICVGIP 2012</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\">\n<div align=\"CENTER\">\n      <img alt=\"photo: Gopi Meenakshisundaram \" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/gopi.jpg\" style=\"margin: auto auto;\"/>\n<p><b> Gopi <br/> Meenakshisundaram </b></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Uddipan Mukherjee\" height=\"90px\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/noteworthy/UddipanMukherjee-noteworthy.jpg\" style=\"height: 90px;\"/>\n<p><b> Uddipan <br/> Mukherjee </b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\n&#8220;<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7egopi/SamplePubs/Tweening.pdf\">Tweening Boundary Curves of Non-Simple Immersions of a Disk</a>,&#8221; by associate professor of computer science \n<strong>Gopi Meenakshisundaram</strong> \nand Ph.D. student \n<strong>Uddipan Mukherjee</strong>, \nwon the sole best paper award at the eighth Indian Conference of Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing (<a href=\"http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/graphics/icvgip2012/\">ICVGIP</a>) held in Mumbai, India. \n</p>\n<p>\nTweening, also known as shape morphing, is an important concept in keyframe animation wherein an initial shape is transformed smoothly into a final shape.

An expert in computer security and privacy, Tsudik leads a team that is exploring security advantages and strengthening potential weaknesses of Named-Data Networking (NDN) in preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Such attacks disable their victims by overloading them with communications from &#8220;zombies&#8221; or &#8220;bots&#8221; &#8212; that is, computers that have already been compromised by hackers for malicious purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\nNDN aims to replace the current Internet Protocol (IP). Rather than the IP method of assigning names to computers and addresses to their network interfaces, NDN names the content that travels through the network. To provide trust in communicated information, each piece of named content must be signed by its producer.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe current IP-based Internet allows anyone to &#8220;talk&#8221; to any entity, such as a computer or a router. This opens the door for DoS and attack types. And attacks are not the only problem with today&#8217;s Internet. Tsudik says the Internet&#8217;s decades-old architecture &#8220;was not designed for the kind of communication that takes place over it today: web traffic and rich multimedia communication. It was primarily designed for email and remote terminal access.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nIn other words, the Internet is not just threatened by hackers and other miscreants; it is also a victim of its own popularity.
