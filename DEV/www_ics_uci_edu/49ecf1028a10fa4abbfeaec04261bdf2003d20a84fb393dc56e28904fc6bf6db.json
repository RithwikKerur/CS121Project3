Changes since draft-ietf-webdav-protocol-04.txt</h3>\n\n   [Editor's note: This section will not appear in the final form of\n   this document.  Its purpose is to provide a concise list of changes\n   from the previous revision of the draft for use by reviewers.]\n\n<P>Added this change section.\n\n<P>Removed scoping for namespaces so the namespace for\n   every element is explicitly stated.\n\n<P>Changed the syntax from &lt;?XML:Namespace.../&gt; to &lt;?namespace...?&gt;.\n\n<P>Removed propfindresult, this was left over from the old search\n   format.\n\n<P>Changed all the DAV XML element names to lower case.\n\n<P>Changed the property format to use Name and Namespace rather than\n   name and schema.\n\n<P>Removed proploc attribute and removed section on GETting, DELETEing,\n   and PUTing properties since we do not provide a mechanism for\n   getting a URI for properties.  Also removed the requirement that\n   properties be URI addressable.\n\n<P>Removed quoted string choice from owner header, it is just XML.\n\n<P>Made all the HTTP error codes use the same format.\n\n<P>Changed the name of the create element in <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> to set, the new\n   name seems to cause less confusion.\n\n<P>Moved all headers in the draft to a single section.\n\n<P>Deleted the state token section of the draft and moved the state\n   token headers to the header section of the draft.  Removed the state\n   token header.\n\n<P>Changed the write lock section to state that a Lock-Token request\n   header, not a state-token request header, is to be submitted on\n   request for write locked resources.\n\n<P>Created a \"generic\" XML element section for XML elements that get\n   repeatedly re-used throughout the spec.  I moved LINK XML element to\n   this section.\n\n<P>Made <TT> multistatus</TT> and Schema discovery their own level one sections.\n\n<P>Collected all the properties together.\n\n<P>Removed all references to the possibility of properties have their\n   own URIs.  This includes removing the property identifier section.\n\n<P>Separated the section on web collections and namespaces into two\n   separate sections.\n\n<P>Collected all the new response codes together into their own\n   section.\n\n<P>Changed the XML multiresponse element name to <TT> multistatus</TT>.\n\n<P>Added a stand alone section on levels of DAV compliance. I also went\n   method by method, property by property, to specify compliance\n   requirements.\n\n<P>Added an introduction.\n\n<P>Changed all the \"True\" and \"False\" to \"T\" and \"F\".\n\n<P>Altered the first two paragraphs of the Property Names section to\n   make the relationship between a property's name and its schema a\n   little clearer.  I also added some text in the same section defining\n   a property name as a namespace and element.\n\n<P>Added a second paragraph to property model for http resources -\n   overview.  This paragraph clarifies why XML was chosen.\n\n<P>Added a 409 Conflict error to move to cover attempts to move a\n   collection with members.\n\n<P>Changed the collection requirement to read the collections SHOULD\n   end with \"/\".  Also added a SHOULD about returning a location header\n   if the client submits a URL for a collection without a trailing \"/\".\n\n<P>Moved the owner header into the body due to size concerns.\n\n<P>Replaced the iscollection xml element with <TT>resourcetype</TT>.\n\n<P>Moved the DAV property to the <TT>DAV</TT> header that is returned with\n   <TT>OPTIONS</TT>.\n\n<P>Folded the tree draft into this draft.  Changed the <TT>DELETE</TT>, <TT>COPY</TT>,\n   and <TT>MOVE</TT> sections to include their effect on collections as taken\n   from the tree draft.  Created a <TT>Depth</TT> header section and put in the\n   general rules that were in the introduction to the tree draft.  I\n   also added the 102 response and response-status header.\n\n<P>Removed the versioning section.\n\n<P>Put all the methods into a single section.\n\n<P>Replaced the <TT>PROPFIND</TT> request body with a propfind header. Now the\n   response can be cached just using vary.\n\n<P>Nuked resinfo for <TT>INDEX</TT> and combined it with <TT> multistatus</TT> which is\n   now used for both <TT>INDEX</TT> and <TT>PROPFIND</TT>.  Stripped down <TT>INDEX</TT> as\n   agreed.\n\n<P>Removed the problem definition and proposed solution sections. We\n   can always cut and paste them together from the older version if we\n   feel we need them but this draft is supposed to be a dry run for\n   last call and last call documents do not have problem\n   definition/proposed solution sections.\n\n<P>Killed the section on schema discovery, it is controversial and we\n   aren't going to be able to require it.  We should specify it in a\n   different spec.\n\n<P>Added a section on notational conventions used within the document.\n\n<P>Moved the terminology section to the end of the document to provide\n   better flow from the high-level introduction to the specific\n   introduction sections.\n\n<P>Increased the numeric value of the 4xx status codes introduced in\n   this specification to avoid conflicts with the new revision of the\n   HTTP/1.1 specification, which introduces two new 4xx status codes.\n\n<P>Wrote internationalization concerns section.\n\n<P>Added XML version number to all examples.\n\n<h2>Contents</h2>\n<PRE>\n\nSTATUS OF THIS MEMO...................................................1\nABSTRACT..............................................................1\nCHANGES...............................................................1\n\n1.1.

Introduction</h2>\n\n<P>This document describes an extension to the HTTP/1.1 protocol that\n   allows clients to perform remote web content authoring operations.\n   This extension provides a coherent set of methods, headers, request\n   entity body formats, and response entity body formats that provide\n   operations for:\n\n<P>Properties: The ability to create, remove, and query information\n   about Web pages, such as its author, creation date, etc. Also, the\n   ability to link pages of any media type to related pages.\n\n<P>Collections: The ability to create sets of related documents, and to\n   receive a listing of pages at a particular hierarchy level (like a\n   directory listing in a file system).\n\n<P>Locking: The ability to keep more than one person from working on a\n   document at the same time. This prevents the \"lost update problem\"\n   in which modifications are lost as first one author, then another\n   writes their changes without merging the other author's changes\n\n<P>Namespace Operations: The ability to copy and move Web resources\n\n<P>Efficient Update: The ability to send changes which are proportional\n   to the size of the change rather than retransmitting the entire\n   resource.\n\n<P>Requirements and rationale for these operations are described in a\n   companion document, \"Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and\n   Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web\" [Slein et al., 1997].\n\n<P>The sections below provide a detailed introduction to resource\n   properties (Section 3), collections of resources (Section 4), and\n   locking operations (Section 5).  These sections introduce the\n   abstractions manipulated by the WebDAV-specific HTTP methods\n   described in Section 8, \"HTTP Methods for Distributed Authoring\".\n\n<P>In HTTP/1.1, method parameter information was exclusively encoded in\n   HTTP headers. Unlike HTTP/1.1, WebDAV, encodes method parameter\n   information either in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) [Bray,\n   Sperberg-McQueen, 1997] request entity body, or in an HTTP header.\n   The use of XML to encode method parameters was motivated by the\n   ability to add extra XML elements to existing structures, providing\n   extensibility, and by XML's ability to encode information in ISO\n   10646 character sets, providing internationalization support. As a\n   rule of thumb, parameters are encoded in XML entity bodies when they\n   have unbounded length, or when they may be shown to a human user and\n   hence require encoding in an ISO 10646 character set.  Otherwise,\n   parameters are encoded within an HTTP header.  Section 9 describes\n   the new HTTP headers used with WebDAV methods.\n\n<P>In addition to encoding method parameters, XML is used in WebDAV to\n   encode the responses from methods, providing the extensibility and\n   internationalization advantages of XML for method output, as well as\n   input. XML elements used in this specification are defined in\n   Section 12.\n\n<P>While the response codes provided by HTTP/1.1 are sufficient to\n   describe the preponderance of error conditions encountered by WebDAV\n   methods, there are some errors that do not fall neatly into the\n   existing categories.  New status codes developed for the WebDAV\n   methods are defined in Section 10.  Since some WebDAV methods may\n   operate over many resources, the multiresponse status type has been\n   introduced to return status information for multiple resources.\n   Multiresponse status is described in Section 11.\n\n<P>The properties mechanism is employed by WebDAV to store information\n   about the current state of the resource.  For example, when a lock\n   is taken out on a resource, a lock information property describes\n   the current state of the lock. Section 13 defines the properties\n   used within the WebDAV specification.\n\n<P>Finishing off the specification are sections on what it means to be\n   compliant with this specification (Section 14), on\n   internationalization support (Section 15), and on security (Section\n   16).\n\n\n<h2>3. Data Model for Resource Properties</h2>\n\n<h3>3.1. The Resource Property Model</h3>\n\n<P>Properties are pieces of data that describe the state of a resource.\n   Properties are data about data.\n\n<P>Properties are used in distributed authoring environments to provide\n   for efficient discovery and management of resources.  For example, a\n   'subject' property might allow for the indexing of all resources by\n   their subject, and an 'author' property might allow for the\n   discovery of what authors have written which documents.\n\n<P>The DAV property model consists of name/value pairs.  The name of a\n   property identifies the property's syntax and semantics, and\n   provides an address by which to refer to that syntax and semantics.\n\n<P>There are two categories of properties: \"live\" and \"non-live\".  A\n   live property has its syntax and semantics enforced by the server.\n   This represents the two cases of a) the value of a property is read-only, maintained by the server, and b) the value of the property is\n   maintained by the client, but server performs syntax checking on\n   submitted values. A non-live property has its syntax and semantics\n   enforced by the client; the server merely records the value of the\n   property verbatim.\n\n<h3>3.2. Existing Metadata Proposals</h3>\n\n<P>Properties have long played an essential role in the maintenance of\n   large document repositories, and many current proposals contain some\n   notion of a property, or discuss web metadata more generally.  These\n   include PICS [Miller et al., 1996], PICS-NG, the Rel/Rev draft\n   [Maloney, 1996], Web Collections, XML [Bray, Sperberg-McQueen,\n   1997], several proposals on representing relationships within HTML,\n   digital signature manifests (DCMF), and a position paper on Web\n   metadata architecture [Berners-Lee, 1997].  Work on PICS-NG and Web\n   Collections has been subsumed by the Resource Definition Framework\n   (RDF) metadata activity of the World Wide Web Consortium, which\n   consists of a network-based data model and an XML representation of\n   that model.\n\n<P>Some proposals come from a digital library perspective.  These\n   include the Dublin Core [Weibel et al., 1995] metadata set and the\n   Warwick Framework [Lagoze, 1996], a container architecture for\n   different metadata schemas.  The literature includes many examples\n   of metadata, including MARC [MARC, 1994], a bibliographic metadata\n   format, and RFC 1807 [Lasher, Cohen, 1995], a technical report\n   bibliographic format employed by the Dienst system. Additionally,\n   the proceedings from the first IEEE Metadata conference describe\n   many community-specific metadata sets.\n\n<P>Participants of the 1996 Metadata II Workshop in Warwick, UK\n   [Lagoze, 1996], noted that, \"new metadata sets will develop as the\n   networked infrastructure matures\" and \"different communities will\n   propose, design, and be responsible for different types of\n   metadata.\" These observations can be corroborated by noting that\n   many community-specific sets of metadata already exist, and there is\n   significant motivation for the development of new forms of metadata\n   as many communities increasingly make their data available in\n   digital form, requiring a metadata format to assist data location\n   and cataloging.\n\n<h3>3.3. Properties and HTTP Headers</h3>\n\n<P>Properties already exist, in a limited sense, in HTTP message\n   headers.  However, in distributed authoring environments a\n   relatively large number of properties are needed to describe the\n   state of a resource, and setting/returning them all through HTTP\n   headers is inefficient.  Thus a mechanism is needed which allows a\n   principal to identify a set of properties in which the principal is\n   interested and to then set or retrieve just those properties.\n\n<h3>3.4. Property Values</h3>\n\n<P>The value of a property is expressed as a well-formed XML document.\n\n<P>XML has been chosen because it is a flexible, self-describing,\n   structured data format that supports rich schema definitions, and\n   because of its support for multiple character sets.  XML's self-describing nature allows any property's value to be extended by\n   adding new elements.  Older clients will not break because they will\n   still have the data specified in the original schema and will ignore\n   elements they do not understand.  XML's support for multiple\n   character sets allows human-readable properties to be encoded and\n   read in a character set familiar to the user.\n\n<h3>3.5. Property Names</h3>\n\n<P>A property name is a universally unique identifier that is\n   associated with a schema that provides information about the syntax\n   and semantics of the property.\n\n<P>Because a property's name is universally unique, clients can depend\n   upon consistent behavior for a particular property across multiple\n   resources, so long as that property is \"live\" on the resources in\n   question.\n\n<P>The XML namespace mechanism, which is based on URIs, is used to name\n   properties because it provides a mechanism to prevent namespace\n   collisions and for varying degrees of administrative control.\n\n<P>The property namespace is flat; that is, no hierarchy of properties\n   is explicitly recognized.  Thus, if a property A and a property A/B\n   exist on a resource, there is no recognition of any relationship\n   between the two properties.  It is expected that a separate\n   specification will eventually be produced which will address issues\n   relating to hierarchical properties.\n\n<P>Finally, it is not possible to define the same property twice on a\n   single resource, as this would cause a collision in the resource's\n   property namespace.\n\n\n<h2>4. Collections of Web Resources</h2>\n\n<P>This section provides a description of a new type of Web resource,\n   the collection, and discusses its interactions with the HTTP URL\n   namespace. The purpose of a collection resource is to model\n   collection-like objects (e.g., filesystem directories) within a\n   server's namespace.\n\n<P>All DAV compliant resources MUST support the HTTP URL namespace\n   model specified herein.\n\n<h3>4.1. Collection Resources</h3>\n\n<P>A collection is a resource whose state consists of an unordered list\n   of internal members, an unordered list of external members, and a\n   set of properties.  An internal member resource MUST have a URI that\n   is immediately relative to the base URI of the collection, that is,\n   a relative URI in which \"../\" is illegal, which MUST begin with \"./\"\n   and which SHOULD contain a \"/\" at the end of the URI if the internal\n   member resource is itself a collection.\n\n<P>An external member resource MUST be an absolute URI that is not an\n   internal URI.  Any given internal or external URI MUST only belong\n   to the collection once, i.e., it is illegal to have multiple\n   instances of the same URI in a collection.  Properties defined on\n   collections behave exactly as do properties on non-collection\n   resources.\n\n<P>There is a standing convention that when a collection is referred to\n   by its name without a trailing slash, the trailing slash is\n   automatically appended.  Due to this, a resource MAY accept a URI\n   without a trailing \"/\" to point to a collection. In this case it\n   SHOULD return a location header in the response pointing to the URL\n   ending with the \"/\".  For example, if a client performs an <TT>INDEX</TT> on\n   http://foo.bar/blah (no trailing slash), the resource\n   http://foo.bar/blah/ (trailing slash) MAY respond as if the\n   operation were invoked on it, and SHOULD return a location header\n   with http://foo.bar/blah/ in it.\n\n\n<h3>4.2. Creation and Retrieval of Collection Resources</h3>\n\n<P>This document specifies the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method to create new collection\n   resources, rather than using the existing HTTP/1.1 <TT>PUT</TT> or <TT>POST</TT>\n   method, for the following reasons\n\n<P>In HTTP/1.1, the <TT>PUT</TT> method is defined to store the request body at\n   the location specified by the Request-URI.  While a description\n   format for a collection can readily be constructed for use with <TT>PUT</TT>,\n   the implications of sending such a description to the server are\n   undesirable.  For example, if a description of a collection that\n   omitted some existing resources were <TT>PUT</TT> to a server, this might be\n   interpreted as a command to remove those members.  This would extend\n   <TT>PUT</TT> to perform <TT>DELETE</TT> functionality, which is undesirable since it\n   changes the semantics of <TT>PUT</TT>, and makes it difficult to control\n   <TT>DELETE</TT> functionality with an access control scheme based on methods.\n\n<P>While the <TT>POST</TT> method is sufficiently open-ended that a \"create a\n   collection\" <TT>POST</TT> command could be constructed, this is undesirable\n   because it would be difficult to separate access control for\n   collection creation from other uses of <TT>POST</TT>.\n\n<P>This document specifies the <TT>INDEX</TT> method for listing the contents of\n   a collection, rather than relying on the existing HTTP/1.1 <TT>GET</TT>\n   method.  This is to avoid conflict with the de-facto standard\n   practice of redirecting a <TT>GET</TT> request on a directory to its\n   index.html resource.\n\n<P>The exact definition of the behavior of <TT>GET</TT> and <TT>PUT</TT> on collections\n   is defined later in this document.\n\n<h3>4.3. HTTP URL Namespace Model</h3>\n\n<P>The HTTP URL Namespace is a hierarchical namespace where the\n   hierarchy is delimited with the \"/\" character.  DAV compliant\n   resources MUST maintain the consistency of the HTTP URL namespace.\n   Any attempt to create a resource (excepting the root member of a\n   namespace) that would not be the internal member of a collection\n   MUST fail. For example, if the collection http://www.foo.bar.org/a/\n   exists, but http://www.foo.bar.org/a/b/does not exist, an attempt to\n   create http://www.foo.bar.org/a/b/c must fail.\n\n<h3>4.4. Source Resources and Output Resources</h3>\n\n<P>For many resources, the entity returned by a <TT>GET</TT> method exactly\n   matches the persistent state of the resource, for example, a GIF\n   file stored on a disk.  For this simple case, the URL at which a\n   resource is accessed is identical to the URL at which the source\n   (the persistent state) of the resource is accessed.  This is also\n   the case for HTML source files that are not processed by the server\n   prior to transmission.\n\n<P>However, the server can sometimes process HTML resources before they\n   are transmitted as a return entity body.  For example, server-side-include directives within an HTML file instruct a server to replace\n   the directive with another value, such as the current date.  In this\n   case, what is returned by <TT>GET</TT> (HTML plus date) differs from the\n   persistent state of the resource (HTML plus directive).  Typically\n   there is no way to access the HTML resource containing the\n   unprocessed directive.\n\n<P>Sometimes the entity returned by <TT>GET</TT> is the output of a data-producing process that is described by one or more source resources\n   (that may not even have a location in the URL namespace).  A single\n   data-producing process may dynamically generate the state of a\n   potentially large number of output resources.  An example of this is\n   a CGI script that describes a \"finger\" gateway process that maps\n   part of the namespace of a server into finger requests, such as\n   http://www.foo.bar.org/finger_gateway/user@host.\n\n<P>In the absence of distributed authoring capabilities, it is\n   acceptable to have no mapping of source resource(s) to the URI\n   namespace. In fact, preventing access to the source resource(s) has\n   desirable security benefits.  However, if remote editing of the\n   source resource(s) is desired, the source resource(s) should be\n   given a location in the URI namespace.  This source location should\n   not be one of the locations at which the generated output is\n   retrievable, since in general it is impossible for the server to\n   differentiate requests for source resources from requests for\n   process output resources.  There is often a many-to-many\n   relationship between source resources and output resources.\n\n<P>On WebDAV compliant servers, for all output resources which have a\n   single source resource (and that source resource has a URI), the URI\n   of the source resource SHOULD be stored in a link on the output\n   resource with type http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/source.  Note\n   that by storing the source URIs in links on the output resources,\n   the burden of discovering the source is placed on the authoring\n   client.\n\n\n<h2>5. Locking</h2>\n\n<P>The ability to lock a resource provides a mechanism for serializing\n   access to that resource.  Using a lock, an authoring client can\n   provide a reasonable guarantee that another principal will not\n   modify a resource while it is being edited.  In this way, a client\n   can prevent the \"lost update\" problem.\n\n<P>This specification allows locks to vary over two client-specified\n   parameters, the number of principals involved (exclusive vs. shared)\n   and the type of access to be granted.  Furthermore, this document\n   only provides the definition of locking for one lock access type,\n   the write lock.  However, the syntax is extensible, and permits the\n   eventual specification of other access types.\n\n<h3>5.1. Exclusive Vs. Shared Locks</h3>\n\n<P>The most basic form of lock is an exclusive lock.  This is a lock\n   where the access right in question is only granted to a single\n   principal.  The need for this arbitration results from a desire to\n   avoid having to constantly merge results.\n\n<P>However, there are times when the goal of a lock is not to exclude\n   others from exercising an access right but rather to provide a\n   mechanism for principals to indicate that they intend to exercise\n   their access right.  Shared locks are provided for this case.  A\n   shared lock allows multiple principals to receive a lock.  Hence any\n   principal with appropriate access can get the lock.\n\n<P>With shared locks there are two trust sets that affect a resource.\n   The first trust set is created by access permissions.  Principals\n   who are trusted, for example, may have permission to write the\n   resource.  Those who are not, don't.  Among those who have access\n   permission to write the resource, the set of principals who have\n   taken out a shared lock also must trust each other, creating a\n   (typically) smaller trust set within the access permission write\n   set.\n\n<P>Starting with every possible principal on the Internet, in most\n   situations the vast majority of these principals will not have write\n   access to a given resource.  Of the small number who do have write\n   access, some principals may decide to guarantee their edits are free\n   from overwrite conflicts by using exclusive write locks.  Others may\n   decide they trust their collaborators will not overwrite their work\n   (the potential set of collaborators being the set of principals who\n   have write permission) and use a shared lock, which informs their\n   collaborators that a principal is potentially working on the\n   resource.\n\n<P>The WebDAV extensions to HTTP do not need to provide all of the\n   communications paths necessary for principals to coordinate their\n   activities.  When using shared locks, principals may use any out of\n   band communication channel to coordinate their work (e.g., face-to-face interaction, written notes, post-it notes on the screen,\n   telephone conversation, Email, etc.)  The intent of a shared lock is\n   to let collaborators know who else is potentially working on a\n   resource.\n\n<P>Shared locks are included because experience from web distributed\n   authoring systems has indicated that exclusive write locks are often\n   too rigid.  An exclusive write lock is used to enforce a particular\n   editing process: take out exclusive write lock, read the resource,\n   perform edits, write the resource, release the lock.  This editing\n   process has the problem that locks are not always properly released,\n   for example when a program crashes, or when a lock owner leaves\n   without unlocking a resource.  While both timeouts and\n   administrative action can be used to remove an offending lock,\n   neither mechanism may be available when needed; the timeout may be\n   long or the administrator may not be available.\n\n<P>Despite their potential problems, exclusive write locks are\n   extremely useful, since often a guarantee of freedom from overwrite\n   conflicts is what is needed. This specification provides both\n   exclusive write locks and the less strict mechanism of shared locks.\n\n<h3>5.2. Required Support</h3>\n\n<P>A WebDAV compliant server is not required to support locking in any\n   form.  If the server does support locking it MAY choose to support\n   any combination of exclusive and shared locks for any access types.\n\n<P>The reason for this flexibility is that locking policy strikes to\n   the very heart of the resource management and versioning systems\n   employed by various storage repositories.  These repositories\n   require control over what sort of locking will be made available.\n   For example, some repositories only support shared write locks while\n   others only provide support for exclusive write locks while yet\n   others use no locking at all.  As each system is sufficiently\n   different to merit exclusion of certain locking features, this\n   specification leaves locking as the sole axis of negotiation within\n   WebDAV.\n\n<h3>5.3. Lock Tokens</h3>\n\n<P>A lock token is a URI that identifies a particular lock.  A lock\n   token is returned by every successful <TT>LOCK</TT> operation in the lock-token response header, and can also be discovered through lock\n   discovery on a resource.\n\n<P>Lock token URIs are required to be unique across all resources for\n   all time. This uniqueness constraint allows lock tokens to be\n   submitted across resources and servers without fear of confusion.\n\n<P>This specification provides a lock token URI scheme called\n   opaquelocktoken that meets the uniqueness requirements.  However\n   resources are free to return any URI scheme so long as it meets the\n   uniqueness requirements.\n\n<h3>5.4. opaquelocktoken Lock Token URI Scheme</h3>\n\n<P>The opaquelocktoken URI scheme is designed to be unique across all\n   resources for all time.  Due to this uniqueness quality, a client\n   MAY submit an opaque lock token in a Lock-Token request header and\n   an if-state[-not]-match header on a resource other than the one that\n   returned it.\n\n<P>All resources MUST recognize the opaquelocktoken scheme and, at\n   minimum, recognize that the lock token was not generated by the\n   resource.  Note, however, that resources are not required to\n   generate opaquelocktokens in <TT>LOCK</TT> method responses.\n\n<P>In order to guarantee uniqueness across all resources for all time\n   the opaquelocktoken requires the use of the GUID mechanism.\n\n<P>Opaquelocktoken generators, however, have a choice of how they\n   create these tokens.  They can either generate a new GUID for every\n   lock token they create, which is potentially very expensive, or they\n   can create a single GUID and then add extension characters.  If the\n   second method is selected then the program generating the extensions\n   MUST guarantee that the same extension will never be used twice with\n   the associated GUID.\n\n<PRE>   Opaque-Lock-Token = \"opaquelocktoken\" \":\" GUID [Extension]\n   GUID = ; As defined in [Leach, Salz, 1997]\n   Extension = *urlc   ;urlc is defined in [Berners-Lee et al., 1997]\n   (draft-fielding-url-syntax-07.txt)\n</PRE>\n\n<h3>5.5. Lock Capability Discovery</h3>\n\n<P>Since server lock support is optional, a client trying to lock a\n   resource on a server can either try the lock and hope for the best,\n   or perform some form of discovery to determine what lock\n   capabilities the server supports.  This is known as lock capability\n   discovery.  Lock capability discovery differs from discovery of\n   supported access control types, since there may be access control\n   types without corresponding lock types.  A client can determine what\n   lock types the server supports by retrieving the supportedlock\n   property.\n\n<P>Any DAV compliant resource that supports the <TT>LOCK</TT> method MUST\n   support the supportedlock property.\n\n<h3>5.6. Active Lock Discovery</h3>\n\n<P>If another principal locks a resource that a principal wishes to\n   access, it is useful for the second principal to be able to find out\n   who the first principal is.  For this purpose the lockdiscovery\n   property is provided.  This property lists all outstanding locks,\n   describes their type, and provides their lock token.\n\n<P>Any DAV compliant resource that supports the <TT>LOCK</TT> method MUST\n   support the lockdiscovery property.\n\n\n<h2>6. Write Lock</h2>\n\n<P>This section describes the semantics specific to the write access\n   type for locks.  The write lock is a specific instance of a lock\n   type, and is the only lock type described in this specification.  A\n   DAV compliant resource MAY support the write lock.\n\n<h3>6.1. Methods Restricted by Write Locks</h3>\n\n<P>A write lock prevents a principal without the lock from successfully\n   executing a <TT>PUT</TT>, <TT>POST</TT>, <TT>PATCH</TT>, <TT>PROPPATCH</TT>, <TT>MOVE</TT>, <TT>DELETE</TT>, <TT>MKCOL</TT>, <TT>ADDREF</TT>\n   or <TT>DELREF</TT> on the locked resource.  All other current methods, <TT>GET</TT> in\n   particular, function independent of the lock.\n\n<P>Note, however, that as new methods are created it will be necessary\n   to specify how they interact with a write lock.\n\n<h3>6.2. Write Locks and Properties</h3>\n\n<P>While those without a write lock may not alter a property on a\n   resource it is still possible for the values of live properties to\n   change, even while locked, due to the requirements of their schemas.\n   Only dead properties and live properties defined to respect locks\n   are guaranteed not to change while write locked.\n\n<h3>6.3. Write Locks and Null Resources</h3>\n\n<P>It is possible to assert a write lock on a null resource in order to\n   lock the name.  Please note, however, that locking a null resource\n   effectively makes the resource non-null, as the resource now has\n   lock related properties defined on it.\n\n<h3>6.4. Write Locks and Collections</h3>\n\n<P>A write lock on a collection prevents the addition or removal of\n   members of the collection.  As a consequence, when a principal\n   issues a request to create a new internal member of a collection\n   using <TT>PUT</TT> or <TT>POST</TT>, or to remove an existing internal member of a\n   collection using <TT>DELETE</TT>, this request MUST fail if the principal\n   does not have a write lock on the collection.\n\n<P>However, if a write lock request is issued to a collection\n   containing internal member resources that are currently locked in a\n   manner which conflicts with the write lock, the request MUST fail\n   with a 409 Conflict status code.\n\n<h3>6.5. Write Locks and <TT>COPY</TT>/<TT>MOVE</TT></h3>\n\n<P>The owner of a write lock MUST NOT execute a <TT>MOVE</TT> method on a\n   resource he has locked.  This specification intentionally does not\n   define what happens if a <TT>MOVE</TT> method request is made on a locked\n   resource by the lock's owner.\n\n<P>A <TT>COPY</TT> method invocation MUST NOT duplicate any write locks active\n   on the source.\n\n<h3>6.6. Re-issuing Write Locks</h3>\n\n<P>If a principal already owns a write lock on a resource, any future\n   requests for the same type of write lock, on the same resource,\n   while the principal's previous write lock is in effect, MUST result\n   in a successful response with the same lock token as provided for\n   the currently existing lock.  Two lock requests are defined to be\n   identical if their <TT>Lock-Info</TT> headers are identical.\n\n<h3>6.7. Write Locks and The Lock-Token Request Header</h3>\n\n<P>If a user agent is not required to have knowledge about a lock when\n   requesting an operation on a locked resource, the following scenario\n   might occur.  Program A, run by User A, takes out a write lock on a\n   resource.  Program B, also run by User A, has no knowledge of the\n   lock taken out by Program A, yet performs a <TT>PUT</TT> to the locked\n   resource.  In this scenario, the <TT>PUT</TT> succeeds because locks are\n   associated with a principal, not a program, and thus program B,\n   because it is acting with principal A's credential, is allowed to\n   perform the <TT>PUT</TT>.  However, had program B known about the lock, it\n   would not have overwritten the resource, preferring instead to\n   present a dialog box describing the conflict to the user.  Due to\n   this scenario, a mechanism is needed to prevent different programs\n   from accidentally ignoring locks taken out by other programs with\n   the same authorization.\n\n<P>In order to prevent these collisions the lock token request header\n   is introduced.  Please refer to the Lock Token Request Header\n   section for details and requirements.\n\n<h4>6.7.1. Write Lock Token Example</h4>\n\n<PRE>\n   COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.ics.uci.edu\n   Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html\n   Lock-Token: &lt;opaquelocktoken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2&gt;\n   &lt;opaquelocktoken:AAAASDFcalkjfdas12312&gt;\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n</PRE>\n\n\n<P>In this example, both the source and destination are locked so two\n   lock tokens must be submitted.  If only one of the two resources was\n   locked, then only one token would have to be submitted.\n\n\n<h2>7. Notational Conventions</h2>\n\n<P>Since this document describes a set of extensions to the HTTP/1.1\n   protocol, the augmented BNF used herein to describe protocol\n   elements is exactly the same as described in Section 2.1 of RFC\n   2068, <I>Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1</I> [Fielding et al.,\n   1997].  Since this augmented BNF uses the basic production rules\n   provided in Section 2.2 of RFC 2068, these rules apply to this\n   document as well.\n\n<P>The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [Bradner,\n   1997].\n\n\n<h2>8. HTTP Methods for Distributed Authoring</h2>\n\n<H3>8.1. <TT>PROPFIND</TT></H3>\n\n<P>The <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method retrieves properties defined on the Request-URI,\n   if it is a non-collection resource, or on the Request-URI and\n   potentially its member resources, if the resource is a collection.\n   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method.\n\n<P>A client MAY submit a <TT>Depth</TT> header with a <TT>PROPFIND</TT> on a collection\n   with a value of \"0\", \"1\" or \"infinity\".  DAV compliant servers MUST\n   support the \"0\", \"1\" and \"infinity\" behaviors. By default, the\n   <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method on a collection without a <TT>Depth</TT> header MUST act as\n   if a Depth = infinity header was included.\n\n<P>A client MUST submit a Propfind request header describing what\n   information is being requested.  It is possible to request\n   particular property values, all property values, or a list of the\n   names of the resource's properties.\n\n<P>The response is a text/xml message body that contains a <TT> multistatus</TT>\n   XML element that describes the results of the attempts to retrieve\n   the various properties.  If a property was successfully retrieved\n   then its value MUST be returned in a prop XML element.  If the scope\n   of <TT>PROPFIND</TT> covers more than a single resource, as is the case with\n   Depth values of \"1\" and \"infinity\", each response XML element MUST\n   contain an <TT>href</TT> XML element which identifies the resource on which\n   the properties in the prop XML element are defined. In the case of\n   allprop and propname, if a principal does not have the right to know\n   if a particular property exists, an error MUST NOT be returned.  The\n   results of this method SHOULD NOT be cached.\n\n<h4>8.1.1.

The specified depth is zero, hence the\n   <TT>PROPFIND</TT> applies only to the collection itself, and not to any of\n   its members.  The <TT>Propfind</TT> header specifies the name of four\n   properties whose values are being requested. In this case only two\n   properties were returned, since the principal issuing the request\n   did not have sufficient access rights to see the third and fourth\n   properties.\n\n<h4>8.1.2.

DAV compliant resources MUST support\n   the setting of arbitrary dead properties.\n\n<P>The request message body of a <TT>PROPPATCH</TT> method MUST contain at least\n   one propertyupdate XML element.  Instruction processing MUST occur\n   in the order instructions are received (i.e., from top to bottom),\n   and MUST be performed atomically.\n\n<h4>8.2.1. propertyupdate XML element</h4>\n\n<BR>   Name:       <TT>propertyupdate</TT>\n<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\n<BR>   Purpose:    To contain a request to alter the properties on a\n   resource.\n<BR>   Parent:     None\n<BR>   Values=     1*(set | remove)\n<BR>   Description: This XML element is a container for the information\n   required to modify the properties on the resource.

Specifying the removal of a property that does\n   not exist is not an error.  All the elements in prop MUST be empty,\n   as only the names of properties to be removed are required.\n\n\n<h4>8.2.4. Response Codes</h4>\n\n<LI>   200 OK - The command succeeded.  As there can be a mixture of sets\n   and removes in a body, a 201 Create seems inappropriate.\n\n<LI>   403 Forbidden - The client, for reasons the server chooses not to\n   specify, cannot alter one of the properties.\n\n<LI>   405 Conflict - The client has provided a value whose semantics are\n   not appropriate for the property.

Since the Copyright-Owner property could not be removed, no\n   property modifications occur.  The Method Failure response code for\n   the Authors property indicates this action would have succeeded if\n   it were not for the conflict with removing the Copyright-Owner\n   property.\n\n<h3>8.3. <TT>MKCOL</TT> Method</h3>\n\n<P>The <TT>MKCOL</TT> method is used to create a new collection. All DAV\n   compliant resources MUST support the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method.\n\n<h4>8.3.1. Request</h4>\n\n<P><TT>MKCOL</TT> creates a new collection resource at the location specified by\n   the Request-URI.  If the Request-URI exists, then <TT>MKCOL</TT> must fail.\n   During <TT>MKCOL</TT> processing, a server MUST make the Request-URI a member\n   of its parent collection.  If no such ancestor exists, the method\n   MUST fail.  When the <TT>MKCOL</TT> operation creates a new collection\n   resource, all ancestors MUST already exist, or the method MUST fail\n   with a 409 Conflict status code.  For example, if a request to\n   create collection /a/b/c/d/ is made, and neither /a/b/ nor /a/b/c/\n   exists, the request MUST fail.\n\n<P>When <TT>MKCOL</TT> is invoked without a request body, the newly created\n   collection has no members.\n\n<P>A <TT>MKCOL</TT> request message MAY contain a message body.  The behavior of\n   a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request when the body is present is limited to creating\n   collections, members of a collection, bodies of members and\n   properties on the collections or members.  If the server receives a\n   <TT>MKCOL</TT> request entity type it does not support or understand it MUST\n   respond with a 415 Unsupported Media Type status code.  The exact\n   behavior of <TT>MKCOL</TT> for various request media types is undefined in\n   this document, and will be specified in separate documents.\n\n<h4>8.3.2. Response Codes</h4>\n\n<P>Responses from a <TT>MKCOL</TT> request are not cacheable, since <TT>MKCOL</TT> has\n   non-idempotent semantics.\n\n<LI>   201 Created - The collection or structured resource was created in\n   its entirety.\n\n<LI>   403 Forbidden - This indicates at least one of two conditions: 1)\n   The server does not allow the creation of collections at the given\n   location in its namespace, and 2) The parent collection of the\n   Request-URI exists but cannot accept members.\n\n<LI>   405 Method Not Allowed - <TT>MKCOL</TT> can only be executed on a\n   deleted/non-existent resource.\n\n<LI>   409 Conflict - A collection cannot be made at the Request-URI until\n   one or more intermediate collections have been created.\n\n<LI>   415 Unsupported Media Type- The server does not support the request\n   type of the body.\n\n<LI>   419 Insufficient Space on Resource - The resource does not have\n   sufficient space to record the state of the resource after the\n   execution of this method.\n\n<h4>8.3.3. Example</h4>\n\n<P>This example creates a collection called /webdisc/xfiles/ on the\n   server www.server.org.\n\n<PRE>\n   MKCOL /webdisc/xfiles/ HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.server.org\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>\n\n   HTTP/1.1 201 Created\n</PRE>\n\n<h3>8.4. <TT>INDEX</TT> Method</h3>\n\n<P>The <TT>INDEX</TT> method is used to enumerate the members of a resource.\n   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>INDEX</TT> method if they\n   have members.\n\n<h4>8.4.1. The Request</h4>\n\n<P>For a collection, <TT>INDEX</TT> MUST return a list of its members.  All\n   WebDAV compliant resources MUST support the text/xml response entity\n   described below.  The <TT>INDEX</TT> result for a collection MAY also return\n   a list of the members of child collections, to any depth.\n\n<P>Collections that respond to an <TT>INDEX</TT> method with a text/xml entity\n   MUST contain a single <TT> multistatus</TT> XML element which contains a\n   response XML element for each member.\n\n<P>A resource that supports <TT>INDEX</TT> MUST return the <TT>resourcetype</TT> property\n   for each member.\n\n<P>Note that the prop XML element MAY contain additional properties.\n\n<h4>8.4.2.

All other DAV compliant resources MAY support the <TT>ADDREF</TT>\n   method as appropriate.\n\n<h4>8.5.1. The Request</h4>\n\n<P>The <TT>ADDREF</TT> method adds the URI specified in the Collection-Member\n   header as an external member to the collection specified by the\n   Request-URI.  The value in the <TT>Collection-Member</TT> header MUST be an\n   absolute URI meeting the requirements of an external member URI.\n\n<P>It is not an error if the URI specified in the Collection-Member\n   header already exists as an external member of the collection.\n   However, after processing the <TT>ADDREF</TT> there MUST be only one instance\n   of the URI in the collection.  If the URI specified in the\n   <TT>Collection-Member</TT> header already exists as an internal member of the\n   collection, the <TT>ADDREF</TT> method MUST fail with a 412 Precondition\n   Failed status code.\n\n<h4>8.5.2. Example</h4>\n\n<PRE>\n   ADDREF /~ejw/dav/ HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.ics.uci.edu\n   Collection-Member: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n</PRE>\n\n\n<P>This example adds the URI http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/ as an\n   external member resource of the collection\n   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/dav/.\n\n\n<h3>8.6. <TT>DELREF</TT> Method</h3>\n\n<P>The <TT>DELREF</TT> method is used to remove external members from a\n   resource.  All DAV compliant collection resources MUST support the\n   <TT>DELREF</TT> method.  All other DAV compliant resources MUST support the\n   <TT>DELREF</TT> method only if they support the <TT>ADDREF</TT> method.\n\n<h4>8.6.1. The Request</h4>\n\n<P>The <TT>DELREF</TT> method removes the URI specified in the Collection-Member\n   header from the collection specified by the Request-URI.\n\n<P>DELREFing a URI which is not a member of the collection is not an\n   error.  DELREFing an internal member MUST fail with a 412\n   Precondition Failed status code.\n\n<h4>8.6.2. Example</h4>\n\n<PRE>\n   <TT>DELREF</TT> /~ejw/dav/ HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.ics.udi.edu\n   Collection-Member: http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n</PRE>\n\n<P>This example removes the URI http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/, an\n   external member resource, from the collection\n   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/dav/.\n\n\n<h3>8.7. <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT> for Collections</h3>\n\n<P>The semantics of <TT>GET</TT> are unchanged when applied to a collection,\n   since <TT>GET</TT> is defined as, \"retrieve whatever information (in the form\n   of an entity) is identified by the Request-URI\" [Fielding et al.,\n   1997].  <TT>GET</TT> when applied to a collection MAY return the contents of\n   an \"index.html\" resource, a human-readable view of the contents of\n   the collection, or something else altogether, and hence it is\n   possible the result of a <TT>GET</TT> on a collection will bear no\n   correlation to the state of the collection.\n\n<P>Similarly, since the definition of <TT>HEAD</TT> is a <TT>GET</TT> without a response\n   message body, the semantics of <TT>HEAD</TT> are unmodified when applied to\n   collection resources.\n\n<h3>8.8. <TT>POST</TT> for Collections</h3>\n\n<P>Since by definition the actual function performed by <TT>POST</TT> is\n   determined by the server and often depends on the particular\n   resource, the behavior of <TT>POST</TT> when applied to collections cannot be\n   meaningfully modified because it is largely undefined.  Thus the\n   semantics of <TT>POST</TT> are unmodified when applied to a collection.\n\n<H3>8.9. <TT>DELETE</TT></H3>\n\n<h4>8.9.1. <TT>DELETE</TT> Method for Non-Collection Resources</h4>\n\n<P>If the <TT>DELETE</TT> method is issued to a non-collection resource which is\n   an internal member of a collection, then during <TT>DELETE</TT> processing a\n   server MUST remove the Request-URI from its parent collection.  A\n   server MAY remove the URI of a deleted resource from any collections\n   of which the resource is an external member.\n\n<h4>8.9.2. <TT>DELETE</TT> for Collections</h4>\n\n<P>The <TT>DELETE</TT> method on a collection MUST act as if a Depth = Infinity\n   header was used on it.  A client MUST NOT submit a <TT>Depth</TT> header on a\n   <TT>DELETE</TT> on a collection with any value but Infinity.\n\n<P><TT>DELETE</TT> instructs that the collection specified in the request-URI,\n   the records of its external member resources, and all its internal\n   member resources, are to be deleted.\n\n<P>If any member cannot be deleted then all of the member's progeny\n   MUST NOT be deleted, so as to maintain the namespace.\n\n<P>Any headers included with <TT>DELETE</TT> MUST be applied in processing every\n   resource to be deleted.  In this case, a header of special interest\n   is the <TT>Destroy</TT> header, which specifies the method to be used to\n   delete all resources in the scope of the <TT>DELETE</TT>.\n\n<P>When the <TT>DELETE</TT> method has completed processing it MUST return a\n   consistent namespace.\n\n<P>The response SHOULD be a Multi-Status response that describes the\n   result of the <TT>DELETE</TT> on each affected resource.\n\n<h4>8.9.2.1. Example</h4>\n\n<PRE>\n   DELETE  /container/ HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.foo.bar\n   Destroy: NoUndelete\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>\n\n   HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status\n   Content-Type: text/xml\n   Content-Length: xxxxx\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>   &lt;?XML version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n   &lt;?namespace href = \"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" As = \"d\"?&gt;\n   &lt;d:multistatus&gt;\n     &lt;d:response&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/container/resource1&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/container/resource2&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:status&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK&lt;/d:status&gt;\n     &lt;/d:response&gt;\n     &lt;d:response&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/container/&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:status&gt;HTTP/1.1 420 Method Failure&lt;/d:status&gt;\n     &lt;/d:response&gt;\n     &lt;d:response&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/container/resource3&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:status&gt;HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed&lt;/d:status&gt;\n     &lt;/d:response&gt;\n   &lt;/d:multistatus&gt;\n</PRE>\n\n<P>In this example the attempt to delete\n   http://www.foo.bar/container/resource3 failed because the server was\n   unable to guarantee that resource3 would not be able to be\n   undeleted.  Consequently, the attempt to delete\n   http://www.foo.bar/container/ also failed, but resource1 and\n   resource2 were deleted. Even though a <TT>Depth</TT> header has not been\n   included, a depth of infinity is assumed because the method is on a\n   collection. As this example illustrates, <TT>DELETE</TT> processing need not\n   be atomic.\n\n<H3>8.10. <TT>PUT</TT></H3>\n\n<h4>8.10.1. <TT>PUT</TT> for Non-Collection Resources</h4>\n\n<P>A <TT>PUT</TT> performed on an existing resource replaces the <TT>GET</TT> response\n   entity of the resource.  Properties defined on the resource MAY be\n   recomputed during <TT>PUT</TT> processing.  For example, if a server\n   recognizes the content type of the request body, it may be able to\n   automatically extract information that could be profitably exposed\n   as properties.\n\n<P>A <TT>PUT</TT> that would result in the creation of a resource without an\n   appropriately scoped parent collection MUST fail with a 405 Method\n   Not Allowed.\n\n<h4>8.10.2. <TT>PUT</TT> for Collections</h4>\n\n<P>As defined in the HTTP/1.1 specification [Fielding et al., 1997],\n   the \"<TT>PUT</TT> method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under\n   the supplied Request-URI.\"  Since submission of an entity\n   representing a collection would implicitly encode creation and\n   deletion of resources, this specification intentionally does not\n   define a transmission format for creating a collection using <TT>PUT</TT>.\n   Instead, the <TT>MKCOL</TT> method is defined to create collections.  If a\n   <TT>PUT</TT> is invoked on a collection resource it MUST fail.\n\n<P>When the <TT>PUT</TT> operation creates a new non-collection resource all\n   ancestors MUST already exist.  If all ancestors do not exist, the\n   method MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.  For example, if\n   resource /a/b/c/d.html is to be created and /a/b/c/ does not exist,\n   then the request must fail.\n\n<h3>8.11. <TT>COPY</TT> Method</h3>\n\n<P>The <TT>COPY</TT> method creates a duplicate of the specified resource.  All\n   DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>COPY</TT> method.\n\n<P>Support for the <TT>COPY</TT> method does not guarantee the ability to copy a\n   resource. For example, separate programs may control resources on\n   the same server.  As a result, it may not even be possible to copy a\n   resource to a location that appears to be on the same server.\n\n<h4>8.11.1. The Request</h4>\n\n<P>The <TT>COPY</TT> method creates a duplicate of the source resource, given by\n   the Request-URI, in the destination resource, given by the\n   <TT>Destination</TT> header.  The <TT>Destination</TT> header MUST be present.  The\n   exact behavior of the <TT>COPY</TT> method depends on the type of the source\n   resource.\n\n<h4>8.11.1.1. <TT>COPY</TT> for HTTP/1.1 resources</h4>\n\n<P>When the source resource is not a collection the body of the\n   destination resource MUST be octet-for-octet identical to the body\n   of the source resource.  Alterations to the destination resource do\n   not modify the source resource.  Alterations to the source resource\n   do not modify the destination resource.  Thus, all copies are\n   performed \"by-value\".\n\n<P>All properties on the source resource MUST be duplicated on the\n   destination resource, subject to modifying headers, following the\n   definition for copying properties.\n\n<h4>8.11.1.2. <TT>COPY</TT> for Properties</h4>\n\n<P>The following section defines how properties on a resource are\n   handled during a <TT>COPY</TT> operation.\n\n<P>Live properties SHOULD be duplicated as identically behaving live\n   properties at the destination resource.  Since they are live\n   properties, the server determines the syntax and semantics of these\n   properties.  Properties named by the <TT>Enforce-Live-Properties</TT> header\n   MUST be live on the destination resource, or the method MUST fail.\n   If a property is not named by Enforce-Live-Properties and cannot be\n   copied live, then its value MUST be duplicated, octet-for-octet, in\n   an identically named, dead property on the destination resource.\n\n<P>If a property on the source already exists on the destination\n   resource and the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is set to \"T\" then the property at\n   the destination MUST be overwritten with the property from the\n   source.  If the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is \"F\" and the previous situation\n   exists, then the <TT>COPY</TT> MUST fail with a 409 Conflict.\n\n<h4>8.11.1.3. <TT>COPY</TT> for Collections</h4>\n\n<P>The <TT>COPY</TT> method on a collection without a <TT>Depth</TT> header MUST act as\n   if a Depth = infinity header was included.  A client MAY submit a\n   <TT>Depth</TT> header on a <TT>COPY</TT> on a collection with a value of \"0\" or\n   \"infinity\".  DAV compliant servers MUST support the \"0\" and\n   \"infinity\" behaviors.\n\n<P>A <TT>COPY</TT> of depth infinity instructs that the collection specified in\n   the Request-URI, the records of its external member resources, and\n   all its internal member resources, are to be copied to a location\n   relative to the <TT>Destination</TT> header.\n\n<P>A <TT>COPY</TT> of depth \"0\" only instructs that the collection, the\n   properties, and its external members, not its internal members, are\n   to be copied.\n\n<P>Any headers included with a <TT>COPY</TT> are to be applied in processing\n   every resource to be copied.\n\n<P>The exception to this rule is the <TT>Destination</TT> header. This header\n   only specifies the destination for the Request-URI.  When applied to\n   members of the collection specified in the request-URI the value of\n   Destination is to be modified to reflect the current location in the\n   hierarchy.  So, if the request-URI is \"a\" and the destination is \"b\"\n   then when a/c/d is processed it MUST use a destination of b/c/d.\n\n<P>When the <TT>COPY</TT> method has completed processing it MUST have created a\n   consistent namespace at the destination.  Thus if it is not possible\n   to <TT>COPY</TT> a collection with internal members, the internal members may\n   still be copied but a collection will have to be created at the\n   destination to contain them.\n\n<P>The response is a Multi-Status response that describes the result of\n   the <TT>COPY</TT> on each affected resource.  The response is given for the\n   resource that was to be copied, not the resource that was created as\n   a result of the copy.  In other words, each entry indicates whether\n   the copy on the resource specified in the <TT>href</TT> succeeded or failed\n   and why.\n\n<P>The exception to this rule is for errors that occurred on the\n   destination.  For example, if the destination was locked the\n   response would indicate the destination URL and a 421 Destination\n   Locked error.\n\n<h4>8.11.1.4. Type Interactions</h4>\n\n<P>If the destination resource identifies a collection and the\n   <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is \"T\", prior to performing the copy the server\n   MUST perform a <TT>DELETE</TT> operation on the collection.\n\n<h4>8.11.2. Response Codes</h4>\n\n<LI>200 OK - The source resource was successfully copied to a pre-existing destination resource.\n\n<LI>201 Created - The source resource was successfully copied.  The copy\n   operation resulted in the creation of a new resource.\n\n<LI>412 Precondition Failed - This status code MUST be returned if the\n   server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties listed\n   in the <TT>Enforce-Live-Properties</TT> header, or if the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is\n   \"F\", and the state of the destination resource is non-null.\n\n<LI>419 Insufficient Space on Resource - The destination resource does\n   not have sufficient space to record the state of the resource after\n   the execution of this method.\n\n<LI>421 Destination Locked - The destination resource was locked and\n   either a valid <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header was not submitted, or the <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header identifies a lock held by another principal.\n\n<LI>500 Server Error - The resource was in such a state that it could\n   not be copied.  This may occur if the <TT>Destination</TT> header specifies a\n   resource that is outside the namespace the resource is able to\n   interact with.\n\n<h4>8.11.3. Overwrite Example</h4>\n\n<P>This example shows resource\n   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being copied to the\n   location http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html.  The\n   contents of the destination resource were overwritten, if non-null.\n\n<PRE>\n   COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.ics.uci.edu\n   Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>\n\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n</PRE>\n\n<h4>8.11.4. No Overwrite Example</h4>\n\n<P>The following example shows the same copy operation being performed,\n   except with the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header set to \"F.\"  A response of 412\n   Precondition Failed is returned because the destination resource has\n   a non-null state.\n\n<PRE>\n   COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.ics.uci.edu\n   Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html\n   Overwrite: \"F\"\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>\n\n   HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed\n</PRE>\n\n<h4>8.11.5. Collection Example</h4>\n\n<PRE>\n   COPY /container/ HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.foo.bar\n   Destination: http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/\n   Enforce-Live-Properties: *\n   Depth: Infinity\n</PRE>\n<PRE>\n\n   HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status\n   Content-Type: text/xml\n   Content-Length: xxxxx\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>   &lt;?XML version=\"1.0\"&gt;\n   &lt;?namespace href = \"http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\" As = \"d\"?&gt;\n   &lt;d:multistatus&gt;\n     &lt;d:response&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/resource1&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/resource2&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/R2/D2&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:status&gt;HTTP/1.1 201 Created&lt;/d:status&gt;\n     &lt;/d:response&gt;\n     &lt;d:response&gt;\n          &lt;d:href&gt;http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/R2/&lt;/d:href&gt;\n          &lt;d:status&gt;HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed&lt;/d:status&gt;\n     &lt;/d:response&gt;\n   &lt;/d:multistatus&gt;\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>Depth</TT> header is unnecessary as the default behavior of <TT>COPY</TT> on a\n   collection is to act as if a \"Depth: Infinity\" header had been\n   submitted.  In this example most of the resources, along with the\n   collection, were copied successfully. However the collection R2\n   failed, most likely due to a problem with enforcing live properties.\n   R2's member D2 was successfully copied.  As a result a collection\n   was created at www.foo.bar/othercontainer/R2 to contain D2.\n\n<h3>8.12. <TT>MOVE</TT> Method</h3>\n\n<P>The move operation on a resource is the logical equivalent of a copy\n   followed by a delete, where the actions are performed atomically.\n   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the <TT>MOVE</TT> method.\n\n<P>However, support for the <TT>MOVE</TT> method does not guarantee the ability\n   to move a resource to a particular destination. For example,\n   separate programs may actually control different sets of resources\n   on the same server.  Therefore, it may not even be possible to move\n   a resource within a namespace that appears to belong to the same\n   server.\n\n<h4>8.12.1. The Request</h4>\n\n<P>If a resource exists at the destination, the destination resource\n   will be DELETEd as a side effect of the <TT>MOVE</TT> operation, subject to\n   the restrictions of the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header.\n\n<h4>8.12.2. <TT>MOVE</TT> for Collections</h4>\n\n<P><TT>MOVE</TT> instructs that the collection specified in the Request-URI, the\n   records of its external member resources, and all its internal\n   member resources, are to be moved to a location relative to the\n   <TT>Destination</TT> header.\n\n<P>The <TT>MOVE</TT> method on a collection MUST act as if a Depth \"infinity\"\n   header was used on it.  A client MUST NOT submit a <TT>Depth</TT> header on a\n   <TT>MOVE</TT> on a collection with any value but \"infinity\".\n\n<P>Any headers included with <TT>MOVE</TT> are to be applied in processing every\n   resource to be moved.\n\n<P>The exception to this rule is the <TT>Destination</TT> header.  The behavior\n   of this header is the same as given for <TT>COPY</TT> on collections.\n\n<P>When the <TT>MOVE</TT> method has completed processing it MUST have created a\n   consistent namespace on both the source and destination, creating\n   collections at the source or destination as necessary.\n\n<P>As specified in the definition of <TT>MOVE</TT>, a <TT>MOVE</TT> of a collection over\n   another collection causes the destination collection and all its\n   members to be deleted.\n\n<P>The response is a Multi-Status response that describes the result of\n   the <TT>MOVE</TT> on each affected resource.  The response is given for the\n   resource that was to be moved, not the resource that was created as\n   a result of the move.  In other words, each entry indicates whether\n   the move on the resource specified in the <TT>href</TT> succeeded or failed\n   and why.\n\n<P>The exception to this rule is for errors that occurred on the\n   destination.  For example, if the destination was locked the\n   response would indicate the destination URL and a 421 Destination\n   Locked error.\n\n<h4>8.12.3. Response Codes</h4>\n\n<LI>   200 OK - The move operation was successful.\n\n<LI>   409 Conflict - The <TT>MOVE</TT> was attempted on a collection with members.\n   While the <TT>COPY</TT> part of this operation could succeed the <TT>DELETE</TT> could\n   not.  Therefore the <TT>MOVE</TT> MUST fail.\n\n<LI>   412 Precondition Failed - This status code MUST be returned if the\n   server was unable to maintain the liveness of the properties listed\n   in the <TT>Enforce-Live-Properties</TT> header, or if the <TT>Overwrite</TT> header is\n   \"F\", and the state of the destination resource is non-null.\n\n<LI>   421 Destination Locked - The destination resource was locked and\n   either a valid <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header was not submitted, or the <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header identifies a lock held by another principal.\n\n<LI>   502 Bad Gateway - This may occur when the destination is on another\n   server and the destination server refuses to accept the resource\n\n<h4>8.12.4. Overwrite Example</h4>\n\n<P>This example shows resource\n   http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/index.html being moved to the\n   location http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html.

A lock token will need to be submitted for every\n   resource, both source and destination, anywhere in the scope of the\n   method, that is locked.  In this case the proper lock token was not\n   submitted for the destination http://www.foo.bar/othercontainer/C2.\n   This means that the resource continer/c2 could not be moved,\n   although its child container/C2/R2 could be moved.\n\n<h3>8.13. <TT>LOCK</TT> Method</h3>\n\n<P>The following sections describe the <TT>LOCK</TT> method, which is used to\n   take out a lock of any access type.  These sections on the <TT>LOCK</TT>\n   method describe only those semantics that are specific to the <TT>LOCK</TT>\n   method and are independent of the access type of the lock being\n   requested.  Once the general <TT>LOCK</TT> method has been described,\n   subsequent sections describe the semantics of the \"write\" access\n   type, and the write lock.\n\n<h4>8.13.1. Operation</h4>\n\n<P>A <TT>LOCK</TT> method invocation creates the lock specified by the Lock-Info\n   header on the Request-URI.  Lock method requests SHOULD have a XML\n   request body which contains an Owner XML element for this lock\n   request. The <TT>LOCK</TT> request MAY have a <TT>Timeout</TT> header.\n\n<P>A successful response to a lock invocation MUST include <TT>Lock-Token</TT>\n   and <TT>Timeout</TT> headers.  Clients MUST assume that locks may arbitrarily\n   disappear at any time, regardless of the value given in the Timeout\n   header.  The <TT>Timeout</TT> header only indicates the behavior of the\n   server if \"extraordinary\" circumstances do not occur.  For example,\n   an administrator may remove a lock at any time or the system may\n   crash in such a way that it loses the record of the lock's\n   existence. The response MUST also contain the value of the\n   lockdiscovery property in a prop XML element.\n\n<h4>8.13.2. The Effect of Locks on Properties and Collections</h4>\n\n<P>By default the scope of a lock is the entire state of the resource,\n   including its body and associated properties.  As a result, a lock\n   on a resource also locks the resource's properties, and a lock on a\n   property may lock a property's resource or may restrict the ability\n   to lock the property's resource.  Only a single lock token MUST be\n   used when a lock extends to cover both a resource and its\n   properties.  Note that certain lock types MAY override this\n   behavior.\n\n<P>For collections, a lock also affects the ability to add or remove\n   members.  The nature of the effect depends upon the type of access\n   control involved.\n\n<h4>8.13.3. Locking Replicated Resources</h4>\n\n<P>Some servers automatically replicate resources across multiple URLs.\n   In such a circumstance the server MAY only accept a lock on one of\n   the URLs if the server can guarantee that the lock will be honored\n   across all the URLs.\n\n<h4>8.13.4. Locking Multiple Resources</h4>\n\n<P>The <TT>LOCK</TT> method supports locking multiple resources simultaneously\n   by allowing for the listing of several URIs in the <TT>LOCK</TT> request.\n   These URIs, in addition to the Request-URI, are then to be locked as\n   a result of the <TT>LOCK</TT> method's invocation.  When multiple resources\n   are specified the <TT>LOCK</TT> method only succeeds if all specified\n   resources are successfully locked.\n\n<P>The Lock-Tree option of the lock request specifies that the resource\n   and all its internal children (including internal collections, and\n   their internal members) are to be locked.  This is another mechanism\n   by which a request for a lock on multiple resources can be\n   specified.\n\n<P>Currently existing locks can not be extended to cover more or less\n   resources, and any request to expand or contract the number of\n   resources in a lock MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code. So,\n   for example, if resource A is exclusively write locked and then the\n   same principal asks to exclusively write lock resources A, B, and C,\n   the request will fail as A is already locked and the lock can not be\n   extended.\n\n<P>A successful result will return a single lock token which represents\n   all the resources that have been locked.  If an <TT>UNLOCK</TT> is executed\n   on this token, all associated resources are unlocked.\n\n<P>If the lock cannot be granted to all resources, a 409 Conflict\n   status code MUST be returned with a response entity body containing\n   a <TT> multistatus</TT> XML element describing which resource(s) prevented the\n   lock from being granted.\n\n<h4>8.13.5. Interaction with other Methods</h4>\n\n<P>The interaction of a <TT>LOCK</TT> with various methods is dependent upon the\n   lock type.  However, independent of lock type, a successful <TT>DELETE</TT>\n   of a resource MUST cause all of its locks to be removed.\n\n<h4>8.13.6. Lock Compatibility Table</h4>\n\n<P>The table below describes the behavior that occurs when a lock\n   request is made on a resource.\n\n<table>\n<TR><TH>   Current lock state/<BR>   Lock request<TH>      Shared Lock<TH>       Exclusive<BR>Lock</TR>\n<TR><TD>   None<TD>                     True<TD>              True</TR>\n<TR><TD>  Shared Lock<TD>              True<TD>              False</TR>\n<TR><TD>   Exclusive Lock<TD>           False <TD>            False*</TR>\n</TABLE>\n\n<P>Legend: True = lock MAY be granted.  False = lock MUST NOT be\n   granted.  *=if the principal requesting the lock is the owner of the\n   lock, the lock MAY be regranted.\n\n<P>The current lock state of a resource is given in the leftmost\n   column, and lock requests are listed in the first row.  The\n   intersection of a row and column gives the result of a lock request.\n   For example, if a shared lock is held on a resource, and an\n   exclusive lock is requested, the table entry is \"false\", indicating\n   the lock must not be granted.\n\n<P>If an exclusive or shared lock is re-requested by the principal who\n   owns the lock, the lock MUST be regranted.  If the lock is\n   regranted, the same lock token that was previously issued MUST be\n   returned.\n\n<h4>8.13.7. Owner XML Element</h4>\n\n<BR>   Name:       <TT>owner</TT>\n<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\n<BR>   Purpose:    Provide information about the principal taking out a\n   lock.\n<BR>   Parent:     Any\n<BR>   Values:          XML Elements\n   Descripton: The Owner XML element provides information sufficient\n   for either directly contacting a principal (such as a telephone\n   number or Email URI), or for discovering the principal (such as the\n   URL of a homepage) who owns a lock.\n\n<h4>8.13.8. Lock Response</h4>\n\n<P>A successful lock response MUST contain a Lock-Token response\n   header, a <TT>Timeout</TT> header and a prop XML element in the response body\n   which contains the value of the lockdiscovery property.\n\n<h4>8.13.9. Response Codes</h4>\n\n<LI>   409 Conflict - The resource is locked, so the method has been\n   rejected.\n\n<LI>   412 Precondition Failed - The included Lock-Token was not\n   enforceable on this resource or the server could not satisfy the\n   request in the <TT>Lock-Info</TT> header.\n\n<h4>8.13.10.

In\n   this request, the client has specified that it desires an infinite\n   length lock, if available, otherwise a timeout of 4.1 billion\n   seconds, if available.  The <TT>Owner</TT> header field specifies the web\n   address for contact information for the principal taking out the\n   lock.\n\n<P>This lock request has failed, because the server rejected the lock\n   request for http://foo.bar/blah.  The 409 Conflict status code\n   indicates that the server was unable to satisfy the request because\n   there is a conflict between the state of the resources and the\n   operation named in the request.  Within the <TT> multistatus</TT>, the 202\n   Accepted status code indicates that the lock method was accepted by\n   the resources, and would have been completed if all resources named\n   in the request were able to be locked.  The 403 Forbidden status\n   code indicates that the server does not allow lock requests on this\n   resource.\n\n<h3>8.14. <TT>UNLOCK</TT> Method</h3>\n\n<P>The <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method removes the lock identified by the lock token in\n   the <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header from the Request-URI, and all other resources\n   included in the lock.\n\n<P>Any DAV compliant resource which supports the <TT>LOCK</TT> method MUST\n   support the <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method.\n\n<h4>8.14.1. Example</h4>\n\n<PRE>\n   UNLOCK /workspace/webdav/info.doc HTTP/1.1\n   Host: webdav.sb.aol.com\n   Lock-Token:opaquelocktoken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2\n</PRE>\n<PRE>\n   HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n</PRE>\n\n\n<P>In this example, the lock identified by the lock token\n   \"opaquelocktoken:123AbcEfg1284h23h2\" is successfully removed from\n   the resource http://webdav.sb.aol.com/workspace/webdav/info.doc.  If\n   this lock included more than just one resource, the lock was removed\n   from those resources as well.\n\n<h3>8.15. <TT>PATCH</TT> Method</h3>\n\n<P>The <TT>PATCH</TT> method is used to modify parts of the entity returned in\n   the response to a <TT>GET</TT> method.  DAV compliant resources MAY support\n   the <TT>PATCH</TT> method.\n\n<h4>8.15.1. The Request</h4>\n\n<P>The request entity of the <TT>PATCH</TT> method contains a list of\n   differences between the resource identified by the Request-URI and\n   the desired content of the resource after the <TT>PATCH</TT> action has been\n   applied.  The list of differences is in a format defined by the\n   media type of the entity (e.g., \"application/diff\") and must include\n   sufficient information to allow the server to convert the original\n   version of the resource to the desired version.  Processing\n   performed by <TT>PATCH</TT> is atomic.  Hence all changes MUST be\n   successfully executed or the method fails.  <TT>PATCH</TT> MUST fail if\n   executed on a non-existent resource; i.e., <TT>PATCH</TT> does not create a\n   resource as a side effect.\n\n<P>If the request appears (at least initially) to be acceptable, the\n   server MUST transmit an interim 100 response message after receiving\n   the empty line terminating the request headers and continue\n   processing the request.  Since the semantics of <TT>PATCH</TT> are non-idempotent, responses to this method are not cacheable.\n\n<P>While server support for <TT>PATCH</TT> is optional, if a server does support\n   <TT>PATCH</TT>, it MUST support at least the text/xml diff format defined\n   below.  Support for the VTML difference format [VTML] is\n   recommended, but not required.\n\n<h4>8.15.2. text/xml elements for <TT>PATCH</TT></h4>\n\n<P>The resourceupdate XML element contains a set of XML sub-entities\n   that describe modification operations.  The name and meaning of\n   these XML elements are given below.  Processing of these directives\n   MUST be performed in the order encountered within the XML document.\n   A directive operates on the resource as modified by all previous\n   directives (executed in sequential order).  The length of the\n   resource MAY be extended or reduced by a <TT>PATCH</TT>.\n\n<P>The changes specified by the resourceupdate XML element MUST be\n   executed atomically.\n\n<h4>8.15.2.1. resourceupdate XML Element</h4>\n\n<BR>   Name:       <TT>resourceupdate</TT>\n<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/\n<BR>   Purpose:    Contains an ordered set of changes to a non-collection,\n   non-property resource.\n<BR>   Parent:     None\n<BR>   Value=      *(insert | delete | replace)\n\n\n<h4>8.15.2.2. insert XML Element</h4>\n\n<BR>   Name:       <TT>insert</TT>\n<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/\n<BR>   Purpose:    Insert the XML element's contents starting at the\n   specified octet.\n<BR>   Parent:     resourceupdate\n<BR>   Value:      The insert XML element MUST contain an octet-range XML\n   attribute that specifies an octet position within the body of a\n   resource.  A value of \"end\" specifies the end of the resource.  The\n   body of the insert XML element contains the octets to be inserted.\n\n<P>Please note that in order to protect the white space contained in\n   this XML element the following attribute/value MUST be included in\n   the element: XML-SPACE = \"PRESERVE\". This attribute is defined in\n   the XML specification [Bray, Sperberg-McQueen, 1997].\n\n<h4>8.15.2.3. delete XML Element</h4>\n\n<BR>   Name:       <TT>delete</TT>\n<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/\n<BR>   Purpose:    Removes the specified range of octets.\n<BR>   Parent:     resourceupdate\n<BR>   Value:      The delete XML element MUST contain an octet-range XML\n   attribute.\n\n<P>Discussion: The octets that are deleted are removed, which means the\n   resource is collapsed and the length of the resource is decremented\n   by the size of the octet range.  It is not appropriate to replace\n   deleted octets with zeroed-out octets, since zero is a valid octet\n   value.\n\n<h4>8.15.2.4. replace XML Element</h4>\n\n<BR>   Name:       <TT>replace</TT>\n<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/\n<BR>   Purpose:    Replaces the specified range of octets with the contents\n   of the XML element.  If the number of octets in the XML element is\n   different from the number of octets specified, the update MUST be\n   rejected.\n<BR>   Parent:     resourceupdate\n<BR>   Value:      The replace XML element MUST contain an octet-range XML\n   attribute.  The contents of the entity are the replacement octets.\n\n<P>Please note that in order to protect the white space contained in\n   this XML element the following attribute/value MUST be included in\n   the element: XML-SPACE = \"PRESERVE\"\n                                     .\n\n                                       This attribute is defined in the\n   XML specification [Bray, Sperberg-McQueen, 1997].\n\n<h4>8.15.2.5. octet-range Attribute</h4>\n\n<BR>   Name:       <TT>octet-range</TT>\n<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/patch/\n<BR>   Purpose:    Specifies a range of octets that the enclosing property\n   affects.\n<BR>   Parent:     insert | delete | replace\n<BR>   Value:      number [\"-\" (number | \"end\")]\n               Number = 1*Digit\n\n<BR>   Description: Octet numbering begins with 0.  If the octet contains a\n   single number then the operation is to begin at that octet and to\n   continue for a length specified by the operation.  In the case of a\n   delete, this would mean to delete a single octet.  In the case of an\n   insert this would mean to begin the insertion at the specified octet\n   and to continue for the length of the included value, extending the\n   resource if necessary.  In the case of replace, the replace begins\n   at the specified octet and overwrites all that follow to the length\n   of the included value.\n\n<h4>8.15.3. Response Codes</h4>\n\n<LI>200 OK - The request entity body was processed without error,\n   resulting in an update to the state of the resource.\n\n<LI>409 Conflict - If the update information in the request message body\n   does not make sense given the current state of the resource (e.g.,\n   an instruction to delete a non-existent line), this status code MAY\n   be returned.\n\n<LI>415 Unsupported Media Type - The server does not support the content\n   type of the update instructions in the request message body.\n\n<LI>418 Unprocessable Entity - The entity body submitted with the <TT>PATCH</TT>\n   was not understood by the resource.\n\n<LI>419 Insufficient Space on Resource - The resource does not have\n   sufficient space to record the state of the resource after the\n   execution of this method.\n\n<h4>8.15.4.

HTTP Headers for Distributed Authoring</h2>\n\n<h3>9.1. Collection-Member Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   CollectionMember = \"Collection-Member\" \":\" URI   ; URI is defined in\n   section 3.2.1 of [Fielding et al., 1997]\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>Collection-Member</TT> header specifies the URI of an external\n   resource to be added/deleted to/from a collection.\n\n<h3>9.2. DAV Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   DAV = \"DAV\" \":\" (\"1\" | \"2\" | extend)\n</PRE>\n\n<P>This header indicates that the resource supports the DAV schema and\n   protocol to the level indicated.  All DAV compliant resources MUST\n   return the <TT>DAV</TT> header on all <TT>OPTIONS</TT> responses.\n\n<h3>9.3. Depth Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   Depth = \"Depth\" \":\" (\"0\" | \"1\" | \"infinity\")\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>Depth</TT> header is used with methods executed on collections to\n   indicate whether the method is to be applied only to the collection\n   (Depth = 0), to the collection and its immediate children, (Depth =\n   1), or the collection and all its progeny (Depth = infinity).  Note\n   that Depth = 1 and Depth = infinity behavior only applies to\n   internal member resources, and not to external member resources.\n\n<P>The <TT>Depth</TT> header is only supported if a method's definition\n   explicitly provides for such support.\n\n<P>The following rules are the default behavior for any method that\n   supports the depth header. A method MAY override these defaults by\n   defining different behavior in its definition.\n\n<P>Methods which support the depth header MAY choose not to support all\n   of the header's values and MAY define, on a case by case basis, the\n   behavior of the method on a collection if a depth header is not\n   present. For example, the <TT>MOVE</TT> method only supports Depth = infinity\n   and if a depth header is not present will act as if a Depth =\n   infinity header had been applied.\n\n<P>Clients MUST NOT rely upon methods executing on members of their\n   hierarchies in any particular order or the execution being atomic.\n   Note that methods MAY provide guarantees on ordering and atomicity.\n\n<P>Upon execution, a method with a depth header will perform as much of\n   its assigned task as possible and then return a response specifying\n   what it was able to accomplish and what it failed to do.\n\n<P>So, for example, an attempt to <TT>COPY</TT> a hierarchy may result in some\n   of the members being copied and some not.\n\n<P>Any headers on a method with a depth header MUST be applied to all\n   resources in the scope of the method. For example, an if-match\n   header will have its value applied against every resource in the\n   method's scope and will cause the method to fail if the header fails\n   to match.\n\n<P>If a resource, source or destination, within the scope of the method\n   is locked in such a way as to prevent the successful execution of\n   the method, then the lock token for that resource MUST be submitted\n   with the request in the Lock-Token request header.\n\n<h3>9.4. Destination Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   Destination = \"Destination\" \":\" URI\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>Destination</TT> header specifies a destination resource for methods\n   such as <TT>COPY</TT> and <TT>MOVE</TT>, which take two URIs as parameters.\n\n<h3>9.5. Destroy Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   DestroyHeader = \"Destroy\" \":\" #Choices\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>   Choices = \"VersionDestroy\" | \"NoUndelete\" | \"Undelete\" | extend\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>   Extend = RFC-Reg | Coded-URL\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>   RFC-Req = Token ; This is a token value (defined in section 2.2 of\n   [Fielding et al., 1997]) that has been published as an RFC.\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>   Coded-URL = \"&lt;\" URI \"&gt;\"\n</PRE>\n\n<P>When deleting a resource the client often wishes to specify exactly\n   what sort of delete should be performed.  The <TT>Destroy</TT> header, used\n   with the <TT>Mandatory</TT> header, allows the client to specify the end\n   result it desires.  The <TT>Destroy</TT> header is specified as follows:\n\n<P>The Undelete token requests that, if possible, the resource should\n   be left in a state such that it can be undeleted.  The server is not\n   required to honor this request.\n\n<P>The NoUndelete token requests that the resource MUST NOT be left in\n   a state such that it can be undeleted.\n\n<P>The VersionDestroy token includes the functionality of the\n   NoUndelete token and extends it to include having the server remove\n   all versioning references to the resource that it has control over.\n\n<h3>9.6. Enforce-Live-Properties Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   EnforceLiveProperties = \"Enforce-Live-Properties\" \":\" (\"*\" | \"Omit\"\n   | 1*(Property-Name))\n</PRE>\n\n<PRE>   Property-Name = Coded-URL\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>Enforce-Live-Properties</TT> header specifies properties that MUST be\n   \"live\" after they are copied (moved) to the destination resource of\n   a copy (or move).  If the value \"*\" is given for the header, then it\n   designates all live properties on the source resource.  If the value\n   is \"Omit\" then the server MUST NOT duplicate on the destination\n   resource any properties that are defined on the source resource.  If\n   this header is not included then the server is expected to act as\n   defined by the default property handling behavior of the associated\n   method.\n\n<h3>9.7. If-None-State-Match</h3>\n\n<PRE>   If-None-State-Match = \"If-None-State-Match\" \":\" 1#Coded-URL\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>If-None-State-Match</TT> header is intended to have similar\n   functionality to the <TT>If-None-Match</TT> header defined in section 14.26\n   of RFC 2068.  However the if-none-state-match header is intended for\n   use with any URI which represents state information about a\n   resource, referred to as a state token.  A typical example is a lock\n   token.\n\n<P>If any of the state tokens identifies the current state of the\n   resource, the server MUST NOT perform the requested method.\n   Instead, if the request method was <TT>GET</TT>, <TT>HEAD</TT>, <TT>INDEX</TT>, or <TT>PROPFIND</TT>,\n   the server SHOULD respond with a 304 Not Modified response,\n   including the cache-related entity-header fields (particularly ETag)\n   of the current state of the resource.  For all other request\n   methods, the server MUST respond with a status of 412 Precondition\n   Failed.\n\n<P>If none of the state tokens identifies the current state of the\n   resource, the server MAY perform the requested method.\n\n<P>If any of the tokens is not recognized then the method MUST fail\n   with a 412 Precondition Failed.\n\n<P>Note that the \"AND\" and \"OR\" keywords specified with the <TT>If-State-Match</TT> header are intentionally not defined for If-None-State-Match,\n   because this functionality is not required.\n\n<h3>9.8. If-State-Match</h3>\n\n<PRE>   If-State-Match = \"If-State-Match\" \":\" (\"AND\" | \"OR\") 1#Coded-URL\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>If-State-Match</TT> header is intended to have similar functionality\n   to the <TT>If-Match</TT> header defined in section 14.25 of RFC 2068.\n   However the <TT>If-State-Match</TT> header is intended for use with any URI\n   which represents state information about a resource.  A typical\n   example is a lock token.\n\n<P>If the AND keyword is used and all of the state tokens identify the\n   state of the resource, then the server MAY perform the requested\n   method.  If the OR keyword is used and any of the state tokens\n   identifies the current state of the resource, then the server MAY\n   perform the requested method.  If the keyword requirement for the\n   the keyword used is not met, the server MUST NOT perform the\n   requested method, and MUST return a 412 Precondition Failed\n   response.\n\n<P>If any of the tokens is not recognized then the method MUST fail\n   with a 412 Precondition Failed.\n\n<h3>9.9. Lock-Info Request Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   LockInfo = \"Lock-Info\" \":\" DAVLockType SP DAVLockScope [SP\n   AdditionalLocks] [SP Lock-Tree]\n   DAVLockType = \"LockType\" \"=\" DAVLockTypeValue\n   DAVLockTypeValue = (\"Write\" | Extend)\n   DAVLockScope = \"LockScope\" \"=\" DAVLockScopeValue\n   DAVLockScopeValue = (\"Exclusive\" |\"Shared\" | Extend)\n   AdditionalLocks = \"AddLocks\" \"=\" 1*(\"&lt;\" URI \"&gt;\")\n   Lock-Tree = \"Lock-Tree\" \"=\" (\"T\" | \"F\")\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The Lock-Info request header specifies the scope and type of a lock\n   for a <TT>LOCK</TT> method request.  The syntax specification below is\n   extensible, allowing new type and scope identifiers to be added.\n\n<P>The LockType field specifies the access type of the lock.  At\n   present, this specification only defines one lock type, the \"Write\"\n   lock.  The LockScope field specifies whether the lock is an\n   exclusive lock, or a shared lock.  The AddLocks field specifies\n   additional URIs, beyond the Request-URI, to which the lock request\n   applies.  The LockTree field is used to specify recursive locks.  If\n   the LockTree field is \"T\", the lock request applies to the hierarchy\n   traversal of the internal member resources of the Request-URI, and\n   the AddLocks URIs, inclusive of the Request-URI and the AddLocks\n   URIs.  It is not an error if LockTree is \"T\", and the Request-URI or\n   the AddLocks URIs have no internal member resources.  By default,\n   the value of LockTree is \"F\", and this field MAY be omitted when its\n   value is \"F\".\n\n<h3>9.10. Lock-Token Request Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   Lock-Token = \"Lock-Token\" \":\" 1#Coded-URL\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The Lock-Token request header, containing a lock token owned by the\n   requesting principal, is used by the principal to indicate that the\n   principal is aware of the existence of the lock specified by the\n   lock token.\n\n<P>If the following conditions are met:\n\n   1) The method is restricted by a lock type that requires the\n   submission of a lock token, such as a write lock,\n   2) The user-agent has authenticated itself as a principal,\n   3) The user-agent is submitting a method request to a resource on\n   which the principal owns a write lock,\n\n<P>Then:\n\n   1) The method request MUST include a <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header with the lock\n      token, or,\n   2) The method MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.\n\n<P>If multiple resources are involved with a method, such as a <TT>COPY</TT> or\n   <TT>MOVE</TT> method, then the lock tokens, if any, for all involved\n   resources, MUST be included in the Lock-Token request header.\n\n<P>For example, Program A, used by user A, takes out a write lock on a\n   resource.  Program A then makes a number of <TT>PUT</TT> requests on the\n   locked resource.  All the requests contain a Lock-Token request\n   header that includes the write lock state token.  Program B, also\n   run by User A, then proceeds to perform a <TT>PUT</TT> to the locked\n   resource.  However, program B was not aware of the existence of the\n   lock and so does not include the appropriate Lock-Token request\n   header.  The method is rejected even though principal A is\n   authorized to perform the <TT>PUT</TT>.  Program B can, if it so chooses, now\n   perform lock discovery and obtain the lock token.  Note that\n   programs A and B can perform GETs without using the Lock-Token\n   header because the ability to perform a <TT>GET</TT> is not affected by a\n   write lock.\n\n<P>Having a lock token provides no special access rights.  Anyone can\n   find out anyone else's lock token by performing lock discovery.\n   Locks are to be enforced based upon whatever authentication\n   mechanism is used by the server, not based on the secrecy of the\n   token values.\n\n<h3>9.11. Lock-Token Response Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   Lock-Token = \"Lock-Token\" \":\" Coded-URL\n</PRE>\n\n<P>If a resource is successfully locked then a <TT>Lock-Token</TT> header will\n   be returned containing the lock token that represents the lock.\n\n<h3>9.12. Overwrite Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   Overwrite = \"Overwrite\" \":\" (\"T\" | \"F\")\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>Overwrite</TT> header specifies whether the server should overwrite\n   the state of a non-null destination resource during a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT>.\n   A value of \"F\" states that the server MUST NOT perform the <TT>COPY</TT> or\n   <TT>MOVE</TT> operation if the state of the destination resource is non-null.\n   By default, the value of Overwrite is \"T,\" and a client MAY omit\n   this header from a request when its value is \"T.\" While the\n   <TT>Overwrite</TT> header appears to duplicate the functionality of the If-Match: * header of HTTP/1.1, If-Match applies only to the Request-URI, and not to the Destination of a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT>.\n\n<P>If a <TT>COPY</TT> or <TT>MOVE</TT> is not performed due to the value of the Overwrite\n   header, the method MUST fail with a 409 Conflict status code.\n\n<h3>9.13. Propfind Request Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   Propfind = \"Propfind\" \":\" (\"allprop\" | \"propname\" | RFC-Reg |\n   1*(Property-Name))\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The <TT>Propfind</TT> header is used to specify which properties are to be\n   returned in a <TT>PROPFIND</TT> method.  The properties are identified by\n   their URIs.  Two special tokens are defined for use with the\n   <TT>Propfind</TT> header, allprop and propname.  The allprop token specifies\n   that all property names and values on the resource are to be\n   returned.  The propname token specifies that only a list of property\n   names on the resource are to be returned.\n\n<h3>9.14. Status-URI Response Header</h3>\n\n<P>The Status-URI response header MAY be used with the 102 Processing\n   response code to inform the client as to the status of a method.\n\n<PRE>   Status-URI = \"Status-URI\" \":\" *(Status-Code \"&lt;\" URI \"&gt;\") ; Status-\n   Code is defined in 6.1.1 of [Fielding et al., 1997]\n</PRE>\n\n<P>The URIs listed in the header are source resources which have been\n   affected by the outstanding method.  The status code indicates the\n   resolution of the method on the identified resource.  So, for\n   example, if a <TT>MOVE</TT> method on a collection is outstanding and a 102\n   \"Processing\" response with a Status-URI response header is returned,\n   the included URIs will indicate resources that have had move\n   attempted on them and what the result was.\n\n<h3>9.15. Timeout Header</h3>\n\n<PRE>   TimeOut = \"Timeout\" \":\" 1#TimeType\n   TimeType = (\"Second-\" DAVTimeOutVal | \"Infinite\" | Other)\n   DAVTimeOutVal = 1*digit\n   Other = Extend field-value   ; See section 4.2 of RFC 2068\n</PRE>\n\n<P>Clients MAY include <TT>Timeout</TT> headers in their <TT>LOCK</TT> requests.\n   However, the server is not required to honor or even consider these\n   requests.  Clients MUST NOT submit a Timeout request header with any\n   method other than a <TT>LOCK</TT> method.\n\n<P>A Timeout request header MUST contain at least one TimeType and MAY\n   contain multiple TimeType entries. The purpose of listing multiple\n   TimeType entries is to indicate multiple different values and value\n   types that are acceptable to the client.  The client lists the\n   TimeType entries in order of preference.\n\n<P>The Timeout response header MUST use a Second value, Infinite, or a\n   TimeType the client has indicated familiarity with.  The server MAY\n   assume a client is familiar with any TimeType submitted in a Timeout\n   header.\n\n<P>The \"Second\" TimeType specifies the number of seconds that MUST\n   elapse between granting of the lock at the server, and the automatic\n   removal of the lock.  A server MUST not generate a timeout value for\n   \"Second\" greater than 2^32-1.\n\n<P>The timeout counter is restarted any time an owner of the lock sends\n   a method to any member of the lock, including unsupported methods,\n   or methods which are unsuccessful.  It is recommended that the <TT>HEAD</TT>\n   method be used when the goal is simply to restart the timeout\n   counter.\n\n<P>If the timeout expires then the lock is lost.  Specifically the\n   server SHOULD act as if an <TT>UNLOCK</TT> method was executed by the server\n   on the resource using the lock token of the timed-out lock,\n   performed with its override authority. Thus logs should be updated\n   with the disposition of the lock, notifications should be sent,\n   etc., just as they would be for an <TT>UNLOCK</TT> request.\n\n<P>Servers are advised to pay close attention to the values submitted\n   by clients, as they will be indicative of the type of activity the\n   client intends to perform.  For example, an applet running in a\n   browser may need to lock a resource, but because of the instability\n   of the environment within which the applet is running, the applet\n   may be turned off without warning.  As a result, the applet is\n   likely to ask for a relatively small timeout value so that if the\n   applet dies, the lock can be quickly harvested.  However, a document\n   management system is likely to ask for an extremely long timeout\n   because its user may be planning on going off-line.\n\n<h2>10. Response Code Extensions to HTTP/1.1</h2>\n\n<P>The following response codes are added to those defined in HTTP/1.1\n   [Fielding et al., 1997].\n\n<h3>10.1. 102 Processing</h3>\n\n<P>Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process,\n   especially methods that support the <TT>Depth</TT> header.  In such cases the\n   client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response.  To\n   prevent this the server MAY return a 102 response code to indicate\n   to the client that the server is still processing the method.\n\n<P>If a method is taking longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but\n   arbitrary value) to process the server SHOULD return a 102\n   \"Processing\" response.\n\n<h3>10.2. 207 Multi-Status</h3>\n\n<P>The response requires providing status for multiple independent\n   operations.\n\n<h3>10.3. 418 Unprocessable Entity</h3>\n\n<P>The server understands the content type of the request entity, but\n   was unable to process the contained instructions.\n\n<h3>10.4. 419 Insufficient Space on Resource</h3>\n\n<P>The resource does not have sufficient space to record the state of\n   the resource after the execution of this method.\n\n<h3>10.5. 420 Method Failure</h3>\n\n<P>The method was not executed on a particular resource within its\n   scope because some part of the method's execution failed causing the\n   entire method to be aborted.  For example, if a resource could not\n   be moved as part of a <TT>MOVE</TT> method, all the other resources would\n   fail with a 420 Method Failure.\n\n<h3>10.6. 421 Destination Locked</h3>\n\n<P>The destination resource of a method is locked, and either the\n   request did not contain a valid <TT>Lock-Info</TT> header, or the Lock-Info\n   header identifies a lock held by another principal.\n\n\n<h2>11. Multi-Status Response</h2>\n\n<P>The default 207 Multi-Status response body is a text/xml HTTP entity\n   that contains a single XML element called <TT> multistatus</TT>, which\n   contains a set of XML elements called response, one for each 200,\n   300, 400, and 500 series status code generated during the method\n   invocation.  100 series status codes MUST NOT be recorded in a\n   response XML element.\n\n<h3>11.1. <TT> multistatus</TT> XML Element</h3>\n\n<BR>   Name:       <TT>multistatus</TT>\n<BR>   Namespace:  http://www.ietf.org/standards/dav/\n<BR>   Purpose:    Contains multiple response messages.\n<BR>   Parent:     Any\n<BR>   Value:      1*response [responsedescription]\n<BR>   Description: The responsedescription at the top level is used to\n   provide a general message describing the overarching nature of the\n   response.

Each link contains three\n   elements, two of which, <TT>src</TT> and <TT>dst</TT>, are part of the DAV schema\n   defined in this document, and one which is defined by the schema\n   http://www.foocorp.com/project/ (Source, Library, and Makefile).  A\n   client which only implements the elements in the DAV spec will not\n   understand the foocorp elements and will ignore them, thus seeing\n   the expected source and destination links.  An enhanced client may\n   know about the foocorp elements and be able to present the user with\n   additional information about the links.

DAV Compliance Levels</h2>\n\n<P>A DAV compliant resource can choose from two levels of compliance.\n   A client can discover which level a resource supports by executing\n   <TT>OPTIONS</TT> on the resource, and examining the \"DAV\" header which is\n   returned.\n\n<P>Since this document describes extensions to the HTTP/1.1 protocol,\n   minimally all DAV compliant resources, clients, and proxies MUST be\n   compliant with RFC 2068 [Fielding et al., 1997].\n\n<h3>14.1. Level 1</h3>\n\n<P>A level 1 compliant resource MUST meet all \"MUST\" requirements in\n   all sections of this document.\n\n<h3>14.2. Level 2</h3>\n\n<P>A level 2 compliant resource MUST meet all level 1 requirements and\n   support the supportedlock property as well as the <TT>LOCK</TT> method.\n\n\n<h2>15. Internationalization Considerations</h2>\n\n<P>In the realm of internationalization issues, this specification is\n   substantively in compliance with the IETF Character Set Policy\n   [Alvestrand, 1997]. In this specification, human-readable fields can\n   be found in either the value of a property, or in an error message\n   returned in a response entity body.  In both cases, the human-readable content is encoded using XML, which has explicit provisions\n   for character set tagging and encoding, and requires by default that\n   XML processors read XML elements encoded using the UTF-8 and UCS-2\n   encodings of the ISO 10646 basic multilingual plane.  Furthermore,\n   XML contains provisions for encoding XML elements using other\n   encoding schemes, notable among them UCS-4, which permits encoding\n   of characters from any ISO 10646 character plane.\n\n<P>The default character set encoding for XML data in this\n   specification, and in general, is UTF-8.  WebDAV compliant\n   applications MUST support the UTF-8 and UCS-2 character set\n   encodings for XML elements, and SHOULD support the UCS-4 encoding.\n   The XML character set encoding declaration for each supported\n   character set MUST also be supported, since it is by using this\n   encoding declaration that an XML processor determines the encoding\n   of an element.\n\n<P>XML also provides language tagging capability which provides the\n   ability to specify the language of the contents of a particular XML\n   element.  Although XML, and hence WebDAV, does not use RFC 1766\n   language tags for its language names, the benefit of using standard\n   XML in this context outweighs the advantage of using RFC 1766\n   language tags.\n\n<P>Names used within this specification fall into two categories: names\n   specific to protocol elements such as methods and headers, names of\n   XML elements, and names of properties.  Naming of protocol elements\n   follows the precedent of HTTP, using English names encoded in\n   USASCII for methods and headers.  Since these protocol elements are\n   not visible to users, and are in fact simply long token identifiers,\n   they do not need to support encoding in multiple character sets.\n   Similarly, though the names of XML elements used in this\n   specification are English names encoded in UTF-8, these names are\n   not visible to the user, and hence do not need to support multiple\n   character set encodings.\n\n<P>The name of a property defined on a resource is a URI.  Although\n   some applications (e.g., a generic property viewer) will display\n   property URIs directly to their users, it is expected that the\n   typical application will use a fixed set of properties, and will\n   provide a mapping from the property name URI to a human-readable\n   field when displaying the property name to a user.  It is only in\n   the case where the set of properties is not known ahead of time that\n   an application need display a property name URI to a user. We\n   recommend that applications provide human-readable property names\n   wherever feasible.\n\n<P>For error reporting, we follow the convention of HTTP/1.1 status\n   codes, including with each status code a short, English description\n   of the code (e.g., 421 Destination Locked).  While the possibility\n   exists that a poorly crafted user agent would display this message\n   to a user, internationalized applications will ignore this message,\n   and display an appropriate message in the user's language and\n   character set.\n\n<P>Since interoperation of clients and servers does not require locale\n   information, this specification does not specify any mechanism for\n   transmission of this information.\n\n\n<h2>16. Security Considerations</h2>\n   [TBD]\n\n\n<h2>17. Terminology</h2>\n\n<P>Collection - A resource that contains member resources.\n\n<P>Member Resource - A resource contained by a collection.  There are\n   two types of member resources: external and internal.\n\n<P>Internal Member Resource - A member resource of a collection whose\n   URI is relative to the URI of the collection.\n\n<P>External Member Resource - A member resource of a collection with an\n   absolute URI that is not relative to its parent's URI.\n\n<P>Property - A name/value pair that contains descriptive information\n   about a resource.\n\n<P>Live Property - A property whose semantics and syntax are enforced\n   by the server.  For example, a live \"content-length\" property would\n   have its value, the length of the entity returned by a <TT>GET</TT> request,\n   automatically calculated by the server.\n\n<P>Dead Property - A property whose semantics and syntax are not\n   enforced by the server.  The server only records the value of a dead\n   property; the client is responsible for maintaining the consistency\n   of the syntax and semantics of a dead property.\n\n\n<h2>18.
