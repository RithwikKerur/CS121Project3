Ellison, Intel\n</em>\n</h2>\n\n<b>Abstract:</b>\n\n<p>\nSPKI (Simple Public Key Infrastructure) is an IETF working group effort\nthat has produced a new view of certificates.  The earlier view was that\na certificate bound a name to a key.  In that view, the namespace of the\ncertificate was vitally important.  SPKI responded to the facts that:\n<p> \n\n<ol>\n<li type=\"1\">\na name certificate often doesn't tell the user of the\n     certificate anything useful; and\n\n<li> a global namespace is almost guaranteed to be unsatisfactory\n        and even a source of bugs.\n</ol>\n\n<p> \n\nThere are, as a result, three namespaces used in SPKI:\n \n<ol>\n<li type=\"a\"> a global namespace of identifiers of keyholders, 1:1 with\n        their public keys, not subject to the bugs mentioned above (2);\n \n<li> a local namespace of human-useable names, as defined by SDSI\n        (with which SPKI has merged);\n \n<li> a local namespace of authorization verbs and parameters,\n        under individual developer control.\n</ol>\n \n \n \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/twist/twist99/\">\nTWIST 99</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
