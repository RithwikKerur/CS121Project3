You will need to show how you solve the\n problem and how you evaluate the quality of your model and solutions.\n\n<p align=\"justify\">\nIn Bayesian network projects you will build a Bayesian network that \nmodels a domain and makes some inferences. Available tools such as SamIam,\nREES, Hugin and JavaBayes can be used. The system can be built using \nknowledge acquisition from expert in the domain or by learning from data \nor both. Some domains used in the past are: Admission to a Phd program, \nLoan expert advisor, Basketball simulator, Handicappers (picking winners \nin horseracing).\n<p align=\"justify\">\nThe domain you select should be sufficiently complex. It should have enough variables (at least 50 variables).\n You would need to validate the model somehow. This can be done by connecting with an expert in the domain or\n by having data. Once you have the network model, you should propose what \n kinds of experimental evaluation to conduct over it.  \n<p align=\"justify\">\n<Hr noshade>\n\n<div class=\"section\">Examples of projects:</div><br>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section\"><a name=class_scheduling>1. Class scheduling.</a></div>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n The problem is to find a schedule for classes, classrooms, and teachers for a teaching setting\n (e.g., a high school, a computer science department). A measure of satisfaction can be to\n minimize the number of weighted constraints violated. Students can use the REES tool to model and\n run their algorithms.

TA assignments.</div>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n Given class schedules for quarter, the number of TAs needed for each class, TAs' preferences and qualification,\n and instructors' choice of preferred TA, schedule the TAs in a way that maximize some measure of satisfaction.\n (Real data may be available, talk to Mark Cartnal).

Advising a first year student.</div>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nA freshman student needs to make many decisions in his first year (what is his major, what classes to take, etc.)\n Build a Bayesian network or a constraint network (or a mixture of both),\n based on your own expertise that will advise a first year student in his first steps on campus.\n See <a href= \"papers/IJAMT_Paper.pdf\">paper</a> by Avi Dechter.\n <br>\n<div class=\"section\">4.

Email management project.</div>\nThe problem: people receive thousands of emails which require some action\n(answer, discard and file). \n<p> \nEmail management becomes unmanageable.\n<p>\nThe project: build a system that helps decide:\n<ol>\n  <li>\n   What email to answer next (prioritize emails)\n <li> What emails to discard and what to file to other folders. \n</ol>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nThe input is a collection of emails that were received. Each message should have a collection of features\n (time of arrival, sender, title, length, number of recipients, topic and response time).\n<p align=\"justify\">\nMethodology: learning: look at past messages received and the decisions made.\n<br>\n<a name=topics>See</a> Padhraic Smyth's <a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/topics.html\">topic modelling page</a>.

Work on research with a grad student.</div>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nYou will have the opportunity to be engaged in a current project, running \nexperiments and reporting results. The task is to evaluate a piece of \nsoftware for processing Bayesian networks called BEEM that uses external \nmemory. We want to test BEEM for optimization and for approximation. You \nwill need to read some papers.\n\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n\n<div id=\"footer\"><centeR>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu\">School of Information and Computer Science</A>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu\">University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3435</a>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter\">Dr. Rina Dechter</A>\n\r\n<A HREF=\"mailto:dechter_at_ics.uci.edu\">dechter at ics.uci.edu</A>\r\n\n</center></div>\n\n</body>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
