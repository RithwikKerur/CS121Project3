The basic Huffman coding\nproblem \ncan be solved in O(n log n) time but variations are more difficult.\nOne \nof the standard techniques for solving these variations utilizes a \ntop-down dynamic programming approach.\nIn this paper we show that this approach is amenable to dynamic\nprogramming speedup techniques, permitting a speedup of an order of \nmagnitude for many algorithms in the literature for such variations\nas \nmixed radix, reserved length and one-ended coding. These speedups are\nimmediate implications of a general structural property that permits\nbatching together the calculation of many DP entries.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
