Pintos is a teaching operating system\n        for 80x86. It is simple and small (compared to Linux). On the other hand,\n        it is realistic enough to help you understand core OS concepts in depth.\n        It supports kernel threads, virtual memory, user programs, and file system.\n        But its original implementations are premature or incomplete. Through the\n        projects, you will be strengthening some of these areas of Pintos to make\n        it complete.</p>\n\n    <p>\n        Since Pintos is designed\n        for 80x86 architecture,\n\t<!--at the end of the projects, -->\n        you could run theoretically\n        the OS that you build on a regular IBM-compatible PC! Of course, during development,\n        running Pintos on bare metal machines each time could be time consuming. Instead,\n        you will run the projects in an x86 emulator, in particular, <a href=\"http://bochs.sourceforge.net\">Bochs</a>\n        or <a href=\"http://fabrice.bellard.free.fr/qemu/\">QEMU</a>. Pintos has also been tested with\n        <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/\">VMWare Player</a>.</p>\n\n    <p> We will start with a pre-project and then do one substantial project.\n        Note that in addition to the pre-project, Pintos has 4 other substantial projects.\n        However, in this class, you will only do one of those substantial projects as the project is only 10% of your grade.\n        Pintos projects are known to be hard. They have a reputation of taking a lot of time. But\n        they are also as rewarding as they are challenging.\n        Moreover, since you are only required to do one of these substantial projects (in addition to the pre-project),\n\twe don't anticipate the project to be very challenging.\n    </p>\n\n    <table class=\"table table-bordered table-striped table-hover\" id=\"schedule-table\">\n        <thead>\n        <tr class=\"info\">\n            <th>Project</th>\n            <th>Weight</th>\n            <th>Due</th>\n        </tr>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"lab0.html\">Lab 0: Getting Real (pre-project)</a></td>\n            <td>20/100</td>\n            <td>02/22/2019 11:55 PM</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"lab1.html\">Lab 1: Threads</a></td>\n            <td>80/100</td>\n            <td>03/20/2019 11:55 PM</td>\n        </tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n    <hr size=\"6\"/>\n\n    <h3 id=\"groups\">Groups</h3>\n    <p>\n        Lab 0 is an individual project.

That\u2019s because <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">pintos --gdb</code> will invoke the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">-s</code> option\n    with QEMU, which in turn is a short-hand for <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">-gdb tcp::1234</code>. So multiple users\n    might try to compete for the same port. We\u2019ve modified the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">pintos</code> script\n    to add two options to work around this.</p>\n\n    <ul>\n      <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">--gdb-port</code> to specify a port explicitly. You can choose any port that\u2019s available\n    to bind gdb, e.g., <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">pintos --gdb --gdb-port=2430</code>.</li>\n      <li><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">--uport</code> to calculate a port number deterministically based on the user id.\n    So different users on the lab machines will get a different port. Example:\n    <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">pintos --gdb --uport</code>. You can find the generated port in the command verbose\n    output (e.g., <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">qemu-system-i386 ... -gdb tcp::25501</code>).</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p>When you use these two options, you also need to change the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">target remote</code> command\n    in the gdb session to point to the specified/calculated port instead of 1234.</p>\n\n    \n    <hr size=\"6\"/>\n    -->\n\n    <h3 id=\"cheating-and-collaboration\">Cheating and Collaboration</h3>\n    <div class=\"panel panel-danger\">\n        <div class=\"panel-heading\">\n            <strong>Warning!</strong>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"panel-body\">\n            This class has zero tolerance for cheating.
