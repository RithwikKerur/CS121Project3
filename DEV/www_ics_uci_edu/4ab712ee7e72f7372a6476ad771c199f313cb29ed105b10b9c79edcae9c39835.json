We got addresses mainly from phonebooks.<br>\r\nFor some of the people, we already had partial information.<br>\r\nWe made a spanish translation for south america which paid off.<br>\r\nWe got something like a 35% response rate. An important point in<br>\r\nsuch a letter is to provide a lot of info so that the recipient<br>\r\nknows that this is not one of \"those ripoffs\". Also, important<br>\r\nto include a stamped envelope! BTW any Langsams out there - feel<br>\r\nfree to write. MMC<br> <br> ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n<br> <br>\r\nDr. Michael M. Cohen<br>\r\n183 Palo Verde Terrace<br>\r\nSanta Cruz, CA 95060<br>\r\nJune 4, 1985<br> \r\n<br>\r\nDear Langsam Cousin,<br> \r\n<br>\r\n I am representing a group of cousins who are working on a family history<br>\r\nproject and we would like to involve you in the project. After a number<br>\r\nof years of research, we have found that most of the Langsams alive today<br>\r\nare related through a man named Pesach Langsam who lived during the last<br>\r\nhalf of the 18th century in a village in Galicia. The name of the town was<br>\r\nYawornik (now in Poland). The Austrian government ruled over the area from<br> 1772 until after World War I. Austria insisted that all people under its<br>\r\nrule have last names and so, during Pesach's adulthood, he was apparently<br>\r\ncompelled to adopt a last name. Registration was generally handled on a town<br>\r\nby town basis by officials appointed to handle this process. As most of you<br>\r\nknow, Langsam means slowly in German. We suspect that Pesach did not move<br>\r\nquickly enough for an impatient official and was consequently dubbed Langsam.<br> \r\n<br>\r\nAlthough the name of Pesach's wife has been lost, we do know that she was<br>\r\ndescended from a long line of distinguished rabbis and scholars through<br>\r\nher mother's family. This is a facinating collection of ancestors that<br>\r\nextends back with certainty to Rabbi Solomon ben Isaac, also known as<br>\r\nRashi, who lived in Troyes, France in the 11th and 12th centuries.<br> \r\n<br>\r\nWe are now compiling a book for family use that outlines our common ances-<br>\r\ntoral lines and would be glad to share a copy with anyone who is interested.<br> \r\n<br> Meanwhile, back to Pesach and his wife. They had many children but some<br>\r\ndied young. We know about 5 of his sons. What we are trying to do is place<br>\r\nas many Langsams as possible with one of those sons or identify other lines<br>\r\nof descent. Please examine the following information carefully and then<br>\r\nanswer the enclosed questionaire. We have enclosed a stamped envelope in<br>\r\nthis letter for your convienence.<br> __________________________________________________________________________<br> \r\n<br>\r\nPesach Langsam of Yavornik b about 1740<br> +<br>\r\nNiece of Rabbi Elimelech of Lisensk d 1786<br>\r\n__________________________|_________________________________<br> | | | | |<br>\r\nShabti David Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech Efraim Shmuel Chaim Lieb<br>\r\n1783-1841 1783-1830<br> \r\n<br>\r\n1) Shabti had at least one son: Avraham Abba, who, in turn had at least<br>\r\none son, Pesach David from Malczow. This man had the last name of<br>\r\nMiller, probably due to restrictive marriage laws imposed by the <br>\r\nAustrian government. When a civil marriage did not occur, the children<br>\r\nhad to be known by the mother's name and only the eldest son could<br>\r\nlegally marry for quite a number of years. However, there is much<br>\r\nevidence that there were also Langsam descendents from this line.<br> \r\n<br>\r\n2) David had a son Pesach, who lived over a hundred years. Pesach married<br>\r\na cousin from the Spira line and also someone else. His children were<br>\r\nShimon of Meilitz, Nacha, Sholem of Lancut, Meir of Bircza, and Ita.<br>\r\nWe have identified descendents of all these children except Nacha.<br> <br>\r\n3) Rabbi Tzvi Elimelech (Spira) of Dynow was a famous hasidic rebbe who<br>\r\ntook the name Spira. All of Tzvi Elimelech's sons continued using that<br>\r\nname. We know a graet deal about this family.<br> <br>\r\n4) For Ephriam Shmuel we have identified only one line. He seems to have<br>\r\nhad a son Pesach who married Sarah Miriam Tscherlit. They lived in<br>\r\nBlazowa which is a larger town near Yavornik. My great-great grand-<br>\r\nfather Chaim Efriam Shmuel, born about 1830 was their son. He married<br>\r\nMiriam Landesman and they had five children, all but one of whom has<br>\r\ndescendents in the US. We believe we know about all the descendents<br>\r\nof Chiam Efraim Shmuel, but there may have been other siblings.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n5) Chaim Leib 1783-1830 lived in Blazowa and had 3 children: Menachem<br>\r\nMendel, Mirel,and Yosef Yehuda. Mirel married Yehishua Fish of Dynow.<br>\r\nThe Fish family is well documented. The family of Yosef Yehuda still has<br>\r\nmany holes for us. We know of 6 children: Asher Zelig who married Roiza<br>\r\n(many descendents in Israel), Efriam (who went to the US, no further<br>\r\ncertain knowledge), Nosson Dov Ber (dtr Hannah has descendents in<br>\r\nIsrael, dtr Golda, son Tzvi Hirsh of Vienna, and 2 other sons, one of<br>\r\nwhom came to US), Berish (son Zalman), Golda, Tzvi Elimelech of Lancut<br> (son Aaron came to US, son Yakov and dtr Miriam have descendents in<br>\r\nIsrael).<br>\r\n<br>\r\nMenachem Mendel of Bukowsk, 1834-1915 had 13 children and perhaps 2<br>\r\nwives. The children were Avraham of Przemysl, Gittel mar Eleazar Fischel,<br>\r\nPessia mar Ginsberg, Esther mar Lippe Frank, Jacov Josef of Kanczuga mar<br>\r\nChaya Sura, Channah Mindel mar Chaim Stern of Bukowsk (children took<br>\r\nLangsam name), Yosef of Bukowsk and Dukla mar Hannah, David mar Beila<br>\r\nOrum, Chaim Leib, Ita mar Josef Roth of Sanok, Hinde mar Areh Leib Fish,<br>\r\nChaya mar Issac Gottlieb of Pruchnik, and Miriam mar Tuvia Rand of<br> Bukowsk.<br>\r\n<br> From the five known sons of Pesach Langsam of Yavornik we know of about 1400<br>\r\ndescendents. We also have information on a number of other families which we<br>\r\nsuspect are connected to Pesach but we lack confirming evidence. Among these<br>\r\nfamilies are: Mendel Langsam mar Sarah both born about 1853 lived at 82<br>\r\nColumbia in 1900 (many descendents in US known), Meilach Langsam of Kanczuga<br> mar Golda, Etka Langsam of Pruchnik, Mayer Langsam of Linsk mar Feiga Suss-<br>\r\nfein, Aaron Langsam of Sanok mar Molly, Mayer Langsam of Sienawa, brothers<br>\r\nYehoshua Chaim and Shoel Shrager Langsam (many descendents in US), Isaac ben<br>\r\nSaul 1857-1924 mar Gittel 1857-1923 had 8 children (many lawyers and doctors<br>\r\namong descendents in NY area), and quite a few more. So, even if we can not<br>\r\nconnect your family immediately to Pesach of Yavornik, we may have consider-<br> able information.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nPlease return the enclosed questionaire and help us put the rest of<br>\r\nthe puzzle pieces together!<br>\r\n<br>\r\nBest Wishes,<br>\r\n<br> \r\nMichael M.
