Similarly, it is a skill to \nvisualize 4D objects. As I am trying to improve both, and feel I have had \nsome success visualizing certain 3-manifolds immersed in C^2 (I'm working \non seeing the CP^2 structure), I am a bit less skeptical. I recommend the \nfollowing articles and threads from geometry.college though some take the \nother point of view:\n\n<A HREF=\"http://mathforum.org/news.archives/geometry.college/article120.html\">http://www.forum.swarthmore.edu/news.archives/geometry.college/article120.html</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://mathforum.org/~sarah/HTMLthreads/articletocs/4d.visualization.html\">http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/HTMLthreads/articletocs/4d.visualization.html</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://mathforum.org/~sarah/HTMLthreads/articletocs/viewing.4d.objects.in.3d.html\">http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/HTMLthreads/articletocs/viewing.4d.objects.in.3d.html</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://mathforum.org/news.archives/geometry.college/article211.html\">http://www.forum.swarthmore.edu/news.archives/geometry.college/article211.html</A>\n\nThose are mainly about 4D. Coxeter mentioned that in the course of a long\nwalk, he visualized a chain of polytopes, each the vertex figure of the\nnext, starting with a triangular prism and going to the 9th dimension.\nThis chain can't be extended, and he claims to have seen that, too! (The\nsequence is important in other contexts, and Coxeter was not the first to\ndiscover it. Unfortunately, I can't remember its name.) 4D seems within\nreason, but I would like to know how to develop direct geometric intuition\nabout, say, the E8 or Leech lattices. \n\nDouglas Zare\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~zare\">http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~zare</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
