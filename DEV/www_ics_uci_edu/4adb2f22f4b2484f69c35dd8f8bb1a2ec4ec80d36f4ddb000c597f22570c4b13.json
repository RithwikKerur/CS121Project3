I am afraid I have little more to offer \r\nyou about my husband's family. He confirms that his grandfather Mendel died \r\nin 1932 about 2 months after Herb's Bar Mitzvah.  Mendel attended the Bar \r\nMitzvah which probably was in May. He lived in Brownsville which I understand \r\nis part of Brooklyn. My husband's grandfather is not the Mendel Langsam on \r\nyour website since  our Mendel had 5 children (4 sons and a daughter as noted \r\nin the Langsam-Spira book). The data in the book is essentially correct as \r\nfar as I know...tho' some family members are omitted i.e. the children of \r\nMendel's daughter Bessie Finger. She had a daughter Ethel who was married to \r\nIzzy Rand and a son Izzy Finger who was married to Estelle. The last I knew \r\nof them they both lived in New York. The Fingers had a son who would be in \r\nhis 70s now. I don't know about other children.\r\n\r\n\r\nNoted in the Langsam-Spira book was the fact that they were unable to make \r\nany connection to our family.  Incidentally my in-laws moved to Far Rockaway \r\nin 1925. My husband tells me that he was unaware that there were any other \r\nLangsams there at the time though he knew  a family of Langsams(unrelated) \r\nmoved to the area sometime later.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you do find a connection it would be nice to know....good luck..\r\nRoddy langsam\r\nherblang@aol.com \r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Tue, 17 Jul 2001 19:35:29 -0400\r\nTo: mbjkblos@aol.com,Herblang@aol.com \r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Mendel's Father\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nI found Mendel's death record in NY. The reason I did not find it yesterday \r\nwas that the index has him listed as Mindel. Anyhow, the big news is that on \r\nthe death record it lists his father as Pesach Langsam. His mother's name is \r\na question mark. He was buried in Mt Zion cemetery, here in Queens. I called \r\nthem to make sure I have the right Mendel for Dec 24, 1932, and they told me \r\nthat Henry Langsam of CT paid for perpetual care. The society for the plot is \r\nIndependent Congregation Ohel Itzchok Anshe Zurawner, the same one where David \r\nand Rose are. This society has ties to ZHURAVNO, formerly in Galicia and now \r\npart of Ukraine (see the enclosed map).\r\n\r\nThis means we are definitely related as Pesach is a VERY uncommon Jewish name. \r\nHe was obviously named for the original Pesach Langsam listed in my site. Mendel \r\nwas born too late (1854) to be the original's son. \r\n\r\nI also found a Morris Langsam (1861 - 1912), son of Pesach and Bessie, who was \r\nliving at Prospect Place, Brooklyn, when he passed away. He had quite a few \r\nchildren. Could this have been a brother of Mendel?\r\n\r\nAny other family members that have email that we can include in this discussion?\r\n\r\n-Moishe\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\n\r\nPS: Ellis Island opened in 1892. Mendel came in 1886.\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: Herblang@aol.com \r\nDate: Wed, 18 Jul 2001 19:37:31 EDT \r\nSubject: Re:  Mendel's Father \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com, Mbjkblos@aol.com, Herblang@aol.com \r\nX-Mailer: AOL 3.0.1 for Mac sub 82 \r\n\r\n\r\nHi-\r\nYour last email did jog Herb's memory! His grandfather ,he is certain, lived \r\non Prospect Place near to the corner of Howard Ave. There was a synagogue on \r\nHoward Ave, that his grandfather attended. It's good to know that Henry paid \r\nfor the care of Mendel's grave. David and Rose were his parents. I believe \r\nthat I already told you that Henry died this past May. His wife Gertrude is \r\nalive-but unfortunately in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Barbara tells me \r\nshe is lucid . much of the time. Perhaps if you contacted Barbara she could \r\nfind some iinformation for you . Her father Henry was 10 years older than my \r\nhusband and lived in Brooklyn so would have been much more aware of family \r\nthan my husband was(My father-in-law was Mendel's youngest child and Herb was \r\nhis youngest grandchild.)\r\nI don't have an email address for Barbara Blasveren-the tel#203-795-6806\r\nAgain good luck\r\nRoddy Langsam\r\n\r\n\r\nRe-Morris Langsam-as I mentioned before Herb doesn't recall any other \r\nrelatives.\r\nHerb also corrected me-his family moved to Far Rockaway in 1923 not 1925 \r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 8/29/01</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
