Langsam, is 90 \r\nyears old and lives in a nursing home in Lincolnshire, IL \r\nwith his wife, Helen Grosby Langsam.  My father was born in\r\nEast St. Louis, IL and was the son of David Langsam and his\r\nwife Matilda.  He had no siblings.  My father lived most of\r\nhis adult life in St. Louis and Clayton, MO (a St. Louis \r\nsuburb).  They relocated to this area when it was necessary \r\nfor them to be placed in a nursing home.\r\n\r\nI am married to Leonard Adams and live in Deerfield, IL.  \r\nWe have three sons:\r\nDavid (Columbia, SC), \r\nBruce (Chicago) and \r\nM. Jacob (Rochester,NY).\r\n\r\nBruce is married to Eve Becker.  \r\nMy brother, Joseph, is married to Betty Sayah Langsam\r\nand lives in Short Hills, NJ.  They have three children: \r\nDaniel (Boston Univ),\r\nJessica (Univ of Penn) and \r\nDevorah, an elementary school student who lives at home.\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful\r\n\r\nPhyllis Langsam Adams\r\n100 Forestway Drive\r\nDeerfield, IL. 60015\r\n\r\nadlan@aol.com\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom:  Adlan@aol.com\r\nSubject:  Re: Langsam/Miller\r\nPostedDate:  01/18/99 01:08:08 PM\r\nSendTo:  CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential\r\nDeliveredDate:  01/18/99 11:19:04 PM\r\n\r\nDear Moishe\r\n\r\nSorry for the delay in responding to your message.  You may\r\nfeel free to post my message to you or to modify it as you \r\nsee fit.\r\n\r\nDavid Langsam is recorded in the Langsam-Spira family \r\ndocument on page H-7 under what appears to be section H8.2.\r\nIt shows that he was married to Tillie (that was how she was\r\nknown but her actual name was Matilda as I indicated in my \r\nprevious message to you.  I was born in 1941 and my brother\r\nJoseph was born in 1945.  My sons: \r\nDavid (1967), \r\nBruce (1969), \r\nand Michael Jacob --known as Jacob(1971).\r\n\r\nI was told when I grew up that my grandfather, David Langsam,\r\ncame to this country to escape the Austrian army after being\r\nimpressed as part of a campaign by the army to separate \r\nyoung Jewish men from their family and,thus, their culture \r\nand religion.  I was also told that he was from Galicia.  \r\nIn looking at a historical atlas, it appears that the \r\nAustro-Hungarian empire did extend into or at least near to\r\nGalicia, so all this does look authentic to me.\r\n\r\nI see (on page H-8) of the Langsam-Spira document that you \r\nare aware of Perline Langsam and Sigmond Langsam, both of \r\nwhom live in the St. Louis area.\r\nPerline can be contacted at \r\n207 Ambridge Court; \r\nChesterfield, MO 63017.  \r\nHer phone is (314) 576-5311.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact me if you need any more \r\ninformation or assistance.\r\n\r\nPhyllis Adams\r\nadlan@aol.com\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nDan Langsam, son of Joseph, and grandson to Sidney (H8.2), supplied the \r\nfollowing pictures in January 2000:<br>\r\n<a href=\"../frm/fh8sidny.htm\">Sidney Langsam (son of David - H8.2)</a> - 7kb<br>\r\n<a href=\"../frm/fh8helen.htm\">Helen Langsam, wife of Sidney (son of David - H8.2)</a> - 7kb<br>\r\n<a href=\"../frm/fh8nthn2.htm\">Joesph Langsam Family (son of Sidney, grandson of David - H8.2)</a>- 15kb<br>\r\n<a href=\"../frm/fh8nthn1.htm\">Sidney Langsam Family (son of David - H8.2)</a> - 16kb<br>\r\n_____________________________________________________________\r\ndjl61@columbia.edu\r\nMonday January 10, 2000 02:56 PM\r\nTo:   Moishe Miller/PSG/Prudential\r\ncc:\r\nSubject:  RE: Langsam\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would definitely be interested in exploring links between our families.\r\nIn fact, I am currently doing some research, although not to the same\r\nextent\r\nas yours.

I only have two pages\r\nfrom it.  I emailed Susan Wynne to see if she might have any more copies\r\nleft.  There are, in fact several \"cousin\" branches to which I don't know\r\nthe exact blood ties.  One is listed under H8.3-- David D. Langsam\r\n[b.1907] at the head.  I called his daughter Perel/Perline today, who said\r\nthat David D. Langsam was a full nephew of David my great-grandfather, but\r\nthis makes no sense if David my great-grandfather had no full brothers.  I\r\nwould love to able to find the link between my St. Louis kin and the New\r\nYork Langsams-- my interest was kindled when I started correspoding with\r\nMelissa Rose Langsam, a senior at Harvard who lives in the New York metro\r\narea.  I will try to see if I can find any info on Yehoshua Chaim.  I'd\r\nalso\r\nbe happy to provide you with any pictures I can dig up, and to see what\r\nyou've got so far.  I'd even be willing to help you on a larger scale, if\r\nyou so desired.  I'm currently a student at Columbia, living on the Upper\r\nWest Side, and my parents live in New Jersey.  Talk to you soon.\r\n-Dan\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: \"Daniel Langsam\" <djl61@columbia.edu> \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: RE: The Langsam Family \r\nDate: Sun, 30 Jan 2000 21:33:58 -0500 \r\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook IMO, Build 9.0.2416 (9.0.2910.0) \r\nImportance: Normal \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHey Moishe-\r\nThe names of those cousins I was telling you about are Mildred Newman and\r\nHenrietta Horwitz (sp?)
