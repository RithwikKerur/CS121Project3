My mother's maiden name was\r\nGoldberger, direct line from Yoizef Goldberger, son -in -law of the Lisker\r\n(author of Ach Pri T'vua and HaYoshor V'Hatov-more on that later). I only\r\nwish our connection to the Bnei Yissochor was as clear.  I will fill in the\r\nmissing information that I know offhand, as I don't have time to look up\r\ntrees, charts, and birth records right now.  I will fill in what I know in\r\nCAPS, so that it will be easy for you to see what I've added.\r\n    I also forwarded your message to another family member, and told him to\r\nrespond to you as able.\r\n> Descendants of Chana Mindel Uri\r\n>\r\n>          1       Chana Mindel Uri\r\n> ..              +Tzvi Newman\r\n> .........       2       Naftali Yeshaya Hertz Newman    1888 - 1952\r\n> .............           +Ettel GOLDBERGER> .........               *2nd\r\nWife of Nathan Newman:\r\n> .............           +Krantcha GOLDBERGER?

Herschel Newman is married to a Shusterman & living in Fla.\r\n\tAri passed away several yrs ago. \r\n\tI have Chana Mindel Uri's son listed as Shaya Naftali, not Naftali Shaya.If you\r\n\tdon't know of any family members to consult about this, I could probably find\r\n\tsomeone to ask, although I am not in direct, constant contact with them.My aunt\r\n\tis.\r\n    A key Q for you, which would hint at a lot of info:  Do you know who Naftali \r\n\tYeshaya (or reversed) was named after? Again, my Schonfeld Ggrandfather was\r\n\tNaftali Yeshaya Asher, and I don't know of an antecedent with that name, though\r\n\tI can go back 2 more generations.  What about the town of origin?  My Newman\r\n\tsource tells me the Newmans came from Uhely.\r\n    Also, your birthdate for NYH of 1888 seems wrong-or my dob for Ettel of 1863 is\r\n\twrong. Let's check on that if we can.\r\n    At this point I am still in the process of researching & entering Newman family\r\n\tnames.  \r\n                                                    Regards, Elizabeth\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Larry R.

With your extensive and \r\npervasive family tree, it was very simple to trace my family all the way back \r\nto Pesach Langsam.  I am a descendant of R' Yakov Uri, and his second wife \r\nYitta Leah through their daughter Chana Mindel and Tzvi Neuman. One of their \r\ndaughters - Perel (Perri) is the mother of my grandfather.  Perel married \r\nDovid Klein and had 14 children.  I can also help you with Perel's brothers, \r\nas I see your'e missing information after her mother's generation.  And as \r\nfor Perel's descendants I can take you all the way to the youngest baby alive \r\ntoday (though I don't think you want that much information). Please let me \r\nknow how many generations of  information you want and I will do my best to \r\nsend it to you. On another note, I would like to know how I could obtain a \r\ncopy of Suzan Wynne's book \"The Langsam-Spira Family\" that you mention on the \r\nweb site.\r\n                                                            Sincerely,\r\n                                                                Yoni Gottlieb \r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: Mekalhalav@aol.com \r\nDate: Mon, 10 Sep 2001 17:02:04 EDT \r\nSubject: Re: Request? \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\nX-Mailer: AOL 5.0 for Windows sub 138 \r\n\r\n\r\n    This time around the email from August came through, and I will review \r\nall the family information that you have up to this point for Chana Mindel \r\nUri, and will work on filling in as much as I possibly can.  \r\n    As for my own lineage from her, I'd be glad to detail it for you right \r\nnow: As you already have down, one of the children Chana Mindel Uri and Tzvi \r\n(Hersh) Neuman had was Perel (Perri). She was my g-grandmother.  Also, as you \r\nhave down correctly, she perished in the Holacaust. (The Yartzeit we observe \r\nfor her is 27 Iyar 1944).  She was born in Mezalaborce, Hungary in \r\napproximatley 1891-5.  She married Dovid Klein of Satoraljaujhely, Hungary, \r\nwho was born in approximatley 1891. They got married in Mezalaborce in \r\napproximatley 1911-12. One of those children, the sixth,  was Yidel Klein \r\n(born Jan. 12, 1923 in Satoraljaujhely, where the family resided until the \r\nwar). He is my grandfather.  Yidel married (to make matters complex) his \r\nfirst cousin, Sara Klein, my grandmother (born in Polgar, Hungary on August \r\n16, 1927).  They got married in Satoraljaujhely on April 7, 1946.  They lived \r\nin Paris for a couple of years after gettin married, while waitng for visas \r\nto come to America, and finally moved to the US, and had my mother on \r\nFebruary, 28 1949.  They then had 3 other children: Moti, Duddi, and Perri \r\nrespectivley (birthdates for these children, and their children, I'll have to \r\nget for you later).  Anyway my mother married Eli Gottlieb on March 20, 1979. \r\nThey had me, Yoni, on February 18, 1980, Moti on May 12, 1984, and Dani on \r\nMay 31, 1987.  My mother's brother Moti married Malka Gross on  December 16, \r\n1973, and had Esther, Dovid, Binyomin, Elana, Moshe, and Yakov. My mother \r\nnext brother Duddi, married Faigie Honig on July 12, 1987, and had Mordechai \r\nand Shmuel, My mother's youngest sister, Perri, is not married.\r\n    I live on the south shore of Long Island. My address is: 44 Arrowhead Lane\r\n                                                                              \r\nLawrence, NY 11559\r\n    If you have any questions about the above information, please let me \r\nknow.
