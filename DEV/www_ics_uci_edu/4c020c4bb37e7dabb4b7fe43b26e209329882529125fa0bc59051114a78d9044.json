Opaque and determined by the versioning\ntool? Access to a \"default version\"? What about being able to access to the\nwhole tree (or whatever) of versions? VTML allows the access to the whole\nblock of data, and allow the client to parse and show individual versions.\nThis is also useful for differencing and comparison at the client side.\n\nWhat about enquiring about the shape of the version tree (or whatever)? How\ndo I ask: How many branches are growing out of version x? Say I want to\nmerge diverging contributions, and need to know how many offsprings of a\nspecific version have been checked in at this moment.\n\nLarry Masinter writes:\n&gt;Separate out the problem of\n&gt;  a) construct a URL for a previous version of a resource\n&gt;     given the current version of a resource and information\n&gt;     about the server's versioning system\n&gt;  b) determining from two URLs what their version relationship\n&gt;     might be.\n&gt;\n&gt;I think it's reasonable to use URL-decoration for (a) and not for (b).\n\nI really don't see the difference. They both depend on the specifics of the\nversioning system, and therefore at the very least from the opaque\n\"versioning identifier\" contained in the URL. Some naming systems will\ncontain no clue about the relations between versions. E.g. if version\n\"Madagascar\" is derived from version \"Bolivia\", I bet you can't provide\n(a). If the versioning system uses any of the naming schemata proposed in\nthe VTML paper, then you can have the exact relation existing between any\ntwo versions. In both cases, anyway, the URL has nothing to do with this\ndetermination, because it's everything in the versioning identifier, which\nis opaque to the URL decoration (I think we agree on this, don't we?).\n\nDavid Fiander writes:\n&gt;&gt;Fetch the version previous to URL(x).\n&gt;\n&gt;if \"URL(x)\" is a versioned URL, this boils down to\n&gt;\n&gt;       Fetch the version previous to the version \"foo\"\n&gt;\n&gt;which will clearly give the same answer all the time, since every\n&gt;version of the document will only have one immediate predecessor.\n\nUhm, will it? Diverging branches of versions are only one of the possible\noptions for the development of documents. VTML allows for re-joining\nbranches through the MERGE operation, and Palimpsest goes even further by\nallowing versions to be composed of arbitrary collections of changes, so\nthat there can be no proper \"previous version\". This is something that is\nspecific of the versioning system. What I'm trying to say, is that Robert\nPettengi's question may have a unique answer (tree-shaped versioning\nstructure), a non-unique answer (DAG-structure as in VTML), or no\nreasonable answer (sick graph structure as in Palimpsest), depending,\nagain, from the versioning system.\n\nCiao\n\nFabio Vitali\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0054.html\">Fabio Vitali: \"Re: More versioning thoughts\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0052.html\">Fabio Vitali: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
