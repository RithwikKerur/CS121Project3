Some clients are capable of \ndisplaying more files than other, but for the most party they can \nhandle an extremely limited variety.  To display other kinds of \nformatted files, or video, sound, and graphic files, you need a variety \nof external programs.  Typically these are called viewers, although \nplayers, tools, and add-ons are other names for them.  Essentially, the \nadd-ons compensate for the <a \nhref=\"http://www.prosci.uci.edu/ProSciDocs/WebBrowsers.html\">browser's</a> \nlimitations, offering users a \nmeans of fully accessing every link they find on the web.  Add-ons is a \ngeneral term encompassing viewers, players, and other <a \nhref=\"http://www.univ.trieste.it/mmwwwpc/mmwwwpc.html\">multimedia</a> \nadditions to web clients.<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>What is HTML and how does this relate to the World Wide Web?</B></A><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/sample.html\">HTML</a> is a simplified \nderivation of SGML, or Standard Generalized \nMarkup Language, which is a code used to make documents readable across a \nvariety of platforms and software.  HTML operates through a series of \ncodes placed within a text document and these codes are translated by a \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www.cacm.html\">World Wide Web</a> client \ninto specific kinds of formats to be displayed on \nthe screen.  These items include links, lists, headings, titles, images, \nforms and maps.  The documents on the World Wide Web browsers are usually \nHTML documents.  HTML carefully defines the structure of a document so \nthat any browser can read it and display it in a way that is best for \nthat browser. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>Who is Adam Smith and what kind of theory did he propose about the study of economics?</B></A><br>\nAdam Smith is known to be the father of economics.  He believes the \n\"invisible hand\" of self-interest leads individuals to promote the \ninterests of others.  The theorem of the Invisible Hand states that given \na number of ideal conditions, optimizing behavior on the part of \nindividuals and firms under pure competition leads to an efficient \noutcome.  The art of <a \nhref=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/econ/econ.html\">economics</a> \nconsisits in looking not merely at \nthe immediate but at the longer effects of any act or policy; making <a \nhref=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Economy/Markets_and_Investments/\">\ninvestment</a> \nconsists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely\n for one group but \nfor all groups.<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>What is microeconomic and macroeconomics?</B></A><br>\nMicroeconomic is the branch of <a \nhref=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?economics\">economics</a>\n that studies the \ndecisions of individual households and firms.\n  Microeconomics also studies the way in \nwhich individual markets work and the detailed way in which regulation \nand taxes affect the allocation of labor and of goods and services.  \nMacroeconomics is the branch of economics that studies the economy as a \nwhole.  It seeks to understand the big picture rather than the detailed \nindividual choices.  In particular, it studies the determination of the \noverall level of economic activity -- of unemployment, aggregate income, \naverage prices, and <a \nhref=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?inflation\">inflation.</a> \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>Government try to raise wages through Minimum Wage Law, is this a good idea for the economy?</B></A><br>\n<a href=\"http://wuecon.wustl.edu/other_www/EconFAQ/EconFAQ.html\">Economist</a> agree that \nminimum wages hit the hardest on the \nunskilled.  The labor saving technology is constantly being invented, and as a result, \nthe demand skilled types is decreasing.  The amount of hours of labor \navailable at minimum wage exceed the labor demanded, which leads to \nunemployment.  Since there is a preponderance of unskilled workers among \nthe young because they have less opportunity to obtain work experience \nand acquire skills; therefore, the minimum wage still cause more \n<a \nhref=\"http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Community/The-Workplace.html\">umemployment</a> \namong young workers than older workers.  The \nlaw forces the payment of higher wage to the industry; however, that industry can then \ncharge higher prices for its product, so that the burden of paying the \nhigher wage is shifted to consumers. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to \nlist of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 09, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
