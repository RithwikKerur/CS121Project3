You should already have read various lobbyist arguments based on case study materials. Analyze the arguments made by pro and con sides.</p>\r\n        <p>Create a clear recommendation: Think about whether your group likes the &quot;pro&quot; and/or &quot;con&quot; positions. If you are working for a Senator, think about what is good for the constituents of the Senator or you are working for; this includes both the people and the companies in your district. If you are working for a FCC Commissioner, think about what is in the public interest. Also think about your Senator's or FCC Commissioner's political beliefs. See if you can find a different position than either &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;con&quot; that you like better. Decide as a group what your recommendation is. Sketch out what your position will be. </p>\r\n        <p>Decide how to present your recommendation: Decide as a group how to present this to your Senator or FCC Commissioner. (Item #6 on law slide 15.) Make sure to bring in course concepts from both economics and networking to support your position. This is critical and example concepts will be listed on each case study page. Make sure you get your facts correct. </p>\r\n        <p>Create your presentation: Decide as a group what should go into the presentation, and in what order.  (Item #7 on law slide 15.) You will have 8 minutes to present, so a rough guideline is that you should have approximately 8-10 slides (not including the title slide). You will not have nearly enough time to present everything you have learned. Therefore, you should decide what you think is the most important information for your classmates. Create your slides.</p>\r\n        <p>Fine-tune your presentation based on the lobbyist presentations: Attend and listen to the presentations made by the lobbyists in class.  The  day after the lobbyist presentations, review their presentation slides, which you can download from the <a href=\"https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/17461/files/folder/case%20study%20presentations\">Econ 11 / ICS 11 Canvas Files</a>. Decide what you believe and don't believe about these arguments. </p>\r\n        <p>Review and practice your presentation: Review all of the slides your group created. Revise your decision about what should go into the presentation, and in what order, to make the presentation most effective. Practice giving the presentation out loud, refine your timing, and decide how you will communicate with each presenter during the presenation to keep to the agreed upon timing.        </p>\r\n        <p>Create your Final Report: Use your interim report as a starting point. Edit as you see fit, based on your work since you turned in the interim report. Add a summary of the verbal comments you made during your presentation. The Final Report should be approximately 8-10 pages. </p>\r\n      </blockquote>\r\n      <p><strong>The day of your presentation:</strong></p>\r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li><strong>Before the  class, upload your presentation to somewhere where you can very quickly retrieve it in class.</strong> You must use the computer in the classroom.</li>\r\n        <li>During the first 50 minutes of class, your group will present your recommendation to the class.
