They,\nhowever, do not have good bounds on worst case performance for either\nthe exact or the approximate versions of these queries.  Good bounds\nfor the approximate versions exist if a tree has bounds on both the\ndepth and the aspect ratio of the regions --- the aspect ratio is\nsmall if the region is \"well rounded\".  We present Parameterized\nBalanced Aspect Ratio (PBAR) trees and show that they have the desired\nbounds.  A PBAR tree can be constructed using any three given\npartitioning vectors and form regions that are convex; they are\nsuperior to other recently developed data structures that too have\nbounds on the depth and aspect ratio.\n<P>\nThis talk is based on work done jointly with\nBreno De Medeiros and Michael Goodrich.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
