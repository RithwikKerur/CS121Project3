Despite event-based\ninfrastructures have been available for quite a long time for\nlocal-area networks we argue that a number of issues remain to be\nsolved when these technologies are used in a wide-area network\nsetting. In particular, we identify <i>scalability</i> and\n<i>expressiveness</i> as the two major requirements and we see a\nnumber of trade-offs between these two aspects.  This presentation is\nabout SIENA, a research project aimed at formulating architectures and\nalgorithms that implement an event service that is scalable as well as\nexpressive. The design of the event service interface will be\npresented together with a comparison of architectures and routing\nstrategies. Also a validation study based on systematic simulation\nof network scenarios will be discussed.\n \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
