Students will undergo the\nvicissitudes of developing a large-scale software system from the point\nof view of all involved personnel - customer, developer, and manager.\nThis course is a <em> two-quarter </em> project course in which the\nstudents specify, design, construct, test, document, and evolve a\ncomplete software system using concepts learned in ICS 52, 121, and\n141. Special emphasis is placed on the need for and use of teamwork,\nmanagement, planning, and other tools for developing and maintaining\nlarge-scale software systems. Using techniques for formal specification\nand analysis at multiple levels of abstraction are also emphasized, as\nwell as those for usability evaluation and evolution.  \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\nA central focus of this course is the application of the software\nengineering concepts studied in ICS 121 in a significantly sized\nsoftware development project worked on in teams. This course will will\nemphasize well-understood requirements, logical object-oriented design,\neffective oral and written communication of concepts, and group\ncooperation.  \n\n<h3>  How does this class differ from ICS 125? </h3>\n\n<p>  ICS 125 attempts to address all the issues associated with\nteam-based software development in a ten week period.  As a result the\nclass is very intense and very rushed during the last several weeks.\nDepending on the project chosen there is little time for thoughful\nanalysis of requirements, examination of architectural alternatives, or\nrigorous testing.  And certainly there is no time to \"do another lap\",\nevolving the application to meet revised needs or to address shortcomings.\n\n<p>  ICS 126 will be similar to ICS 125 in that a project will be\ndeveloped by teams of students, but there will be opportunity to spend\nmore time on requirements, design, and analysis.  Moreover there will\nbe time to go around the track again.  This second lap is a critical\nlearning experience:  developers will confront the consequences of\ndecisions they made during initial design and implementation.\n\n<h3>  What kind of grade will I get at the end of the first quarter? </h3>\n\n<p>\nA grade of IP (\"in progress\") will be assigned at the end of ICS 126A.  Final \ngrades will be assigned only upon completion of ICS 126A-B.  Naturally, though,\nintermediate marks will be assigned so that students will know how they are\ndoing as the class progresses.\n\n<h3>  Can I get credit for both ICS 125 and ICS 126A&B? </h3>\n\nNo.  Students may not get credit for both 125 and 126A-B.\n\n<h3>  Will this class give me 2 project course credits towards the ICS degree? </h3>\n\nYes!  But you need to understand the ICS degree requirements.\n\n<p>\nStudents entering the program in the Fall of 1997 have a <em> three-project </em>\ncourse requirement, at least two of which must be in different ICS\n\"areas\".  Students entering the program before FQ97 have a <em> two-project </em>\ncourse requirement;  a close reading of upper division requirement \"C\" \nin the 1996-97 catalog will reveal that these two project classes must\nbe in <em> different </em> areas.\n\t\n<p>\nSo, what does this mean for 126A & B?\n\t  \n<p>\nIf you have entered before FQ97 then you cannot use 126A and 126B to satisfy\nthe <em> entire </em> project class requirement.  You will still need to take\none other project class from outside the software area.\n\n<h3>  What will the projects be? </h3>\n\n<p>\nCandidate projects can come from many places:  in AY 97-98 some ICS 126\nteams worked on projects that sponsoring local companies suggested.\nOther teams worked on projects related to on-going research programs in\nthe ICS department.  Other projects may come from the students.\n\n<p>\nChoice of projects is related to many goals.\n\n<p>\nOne key goal is to pick a project of appropriate size.  It must be big\nenough to challenge a team of four students, but not so big as to\ncommandeer everyone's life!  As a result we will spend some time at the\nbeginning of the fall attempting to size various projects.  These\nplanning estimates will be revisited as the course progresses.\n\n<p>\nAnother goal is to select a different project for each team.   Since\neach team will be making regular project presentations to the rest of\nthe class, diversity of projects will enable students to learn from\nexperiences across a range of project topics.\n\n<p>\nStill another goal is to work on something fun and interesting!  I've\nhad students working on flight simulators, generating HTML pages,\nlinking MPEG movie frames via hypertext to other artifacts, and\nbuilding graphical program editors.  There are many opportunities....\n\n<h3>  How will teams be composed? </h3>\n\nEach team will have 4 or 5 people.  I will attempt to balance a team's\naggregate expertise with the project they've decided to work on.  I\nwill also attempt to accommodate personal preferences for teammates.\n\n\n\n<H3> What's the Drop/Add policy?</H3>\n\n<p>\nSince ICS 126 has a strong team project orientation, it is essential\nthat the drop/add process be terminated early.  Therefore <em> NO drops\nor adds </em> of ICS 126A will be permitted after the end of the second\nweek of class, unless there are truly extenuating circumstances.\n\n<p>\nComposition of the teams will be re-examined at the beginning of ICS 126B.\nSimilar to 126A, drops from 126B will not be permitted after the end of the\nsecond week of Winter Quarter.\n\n<hr>\n<h1> Lecture Topics </h1>\n\n<p>\nSince 126 will not be on the tight time schedule that 125 is there will be time\nfor lectures on material supplementary to that in 121 and the other prerequisite\ncourses.  Lectures are anticipated on:\n\t<ul>\n\t<li> Teamwork and team organizations\n\t<li> Project management\n\t<li> Project cost and schedule estimation\n\t<li> Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping\n\t<li> Software architectural choice\n\t<li> Computer-aided software engineering tools and environments\n\t<li> Configuration management and version control\n\t<li> Distributed software engineering\n\t<li> Engineering of distributed applications, including distributed object technology\n\t</ul>\nSpecific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projects\nchosen by the teams.  If several of the projects, for example, are\nconcerned with Internet applications, then lectures on protocols and\nWeb technologies will be included.  Similarly if most projects will be\nusing some particular kind of infrastructure, such as CORBA or ActiveX,\nthen there will be lectures on that.\n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"textbooks\"></a>\n<H1> Textbooks </H1>\n\n<p>\nRegardless of the project chosen, all students will be required to read\n<em> The Mythical Man-Month</em>.  Depending on the projects chosen additional\nreadings from various sources may be required.\n\n<ul>\n<li> REQUIRED:\n<ul>\n<li>\nAuthor:              Fred Brooks\n<li>\nTitle:               The Mythical Man-Month, Anniversary Edition\n<li>\nNew Price:$          24.50 \n<li>\nUsed Price:$         18.40 \n<p>\nNote that this book has a lot of white space and blank pages, so it \nreally will not take you long to read these chapters.\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<a name=\"Teams\"></a>\n<h1> Teams and Meeting Rooms </h1>\n<p>\nEach team will have their own office in the ICS trailers in which to conduct meetings and\n(at their option) do their work.\n\n<a name=\"rooms\"></a>           \n<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2>  \n<TR><td><strong>Team Designator<TD> <STRONG>Meeting Room\t<td> <Strong>Home page <td><strong>Customer Contact </STRONG></tr>  \n\n<TR><td>A (\"Argo/C2\")    \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 6  </a>   \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~team126a/\"> TeamName? </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~peymano/\"> Peyman Oreizy </a> </tr>   \n\n<TR><td>B \"Cargo Router\"   \n<TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 7  </a>   \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~team126b\"> TeamName? </a>    \n<td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kari/\"> Kari Nies </a> </tr>   \n\n<!-- <TR><td>3 (<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~process/RA.HTML\"> Problem Report Tracking</a>)    -->\n<!-- <TD><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wwwoffic/maps/icst1.html\"> CS Trailer Room 9 or 10?  </a>   -->\n<!-- <td>  36163    -->\n<!-- <td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~team126c/\"> The A-Team </a>    -->\n<!-- <td> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gbolcer\"> Greg Bolcer </a> </tr>   -->\n</table>   \n\n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"assignments\"></a>\n<h1> Assignments and Assessment </h1>\n<P>\nThe project is the focus of this course and will be assessed\naccordingly.  It will account for 80% of your grade; this is broken\ndown between deliverables, team process descriptions and updates, a\nteam Web page, and presentations.  The remaining 20% will be divided\namong individual course logs, teamwork, individual leadership, and the\nfinal (if any).\n\n<P>\nTheir relative weighting (as a percentage of your final grade) of each part of the\nproject is as follows for ICS 126A (in the case where there is only a single\nimplementation phase  --- if there are two then these will have to be adjusted):\n<P>\n<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2>\n<TR><td><strong> <STRONG>Assignment <TD><STRONG> Weight     </STRONG><td><strong> On-line versions </strong>\n<tr><td> Prospectus and Plan  \t\t\t\t\t<td> 15 <td> <a href=\"prospectus.html\"> Prospectus </a>\n<tr><td> Requirements\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t<td> 15 <td> <a href=\"requirements.html\"> Requirements </a>\n<tr><td> Architecture/Module Specifications                 <td> 25 <td> <a href=\"design.html\"> Architecture/Design </a>\n<tr><td> Implementation \t\t\t\t\t\t<td> 25 <td> <a href=\"implementation.html\"> Implementation </a>\n</TABLE>\n\n<P>\nDeliverables, and weighting for grading purposes, for ICS 126B will be determined later.\n\n<p> The final examination may consist of a maintenance activity in which a\nminor change will be made to your team project or a small essay.\n\n<h3> Assignments and Due Dates</h3>\n<P>\nDeliverables are due at 2:00 PM on the date indicated in the team's plan.\nNO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.\nThis applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.\nSince you are working in this class\nas part of team, it is the team's responsibility to ensure that assignments\nare turned in on time.  Normal excuses for late assignments, such as\nillness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone on the\nteam is ill  :-)\n\n<P>\nThe ICS 126A part of the project nominally consists of four major assignments.\nThey are equally weighted.  Variations to this may be made to accommodate\nthe particular needs of a given project.\n\n<h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3>\n<P>\nFor all deliverables, except for the last in ICS 126B \nyou will also have the opportunity\nto ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.  You may hand in an improved\nversion of a deliverable one week after that deliverable has been\ngraded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initial\nversion.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to\nuse the techniques and so that you do not implement something from a\nbad design or specification.  As discussed above, you should keep the\nsame responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign new\nresponsibilities for the next phase.\n\n\n<h3> Document Requirements</h3>\n<P>\nAll the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral\nparts of systematic software development.  Their continued, up-to-date\nexistence is necessary for successful system development.\n<b>Do not delete</b> documents after they have been turned in.\n\n<P>\nAll deliverable documents must be prepared on-line and be available as part\nof your project home page..\nIn general, the following should be observed.\n<DL ><DT>Cover \"page\".\n<DD> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving\n<DL ><DT><DD> Project title\n<DT><DD> Development phase and deliverable\n<DT><DD> Date\n<DT><DD> Team name/number\n<DT><DD> Team members\n<DT><DD> Phase manager\n<DT><DD> Phase clerical person\n<DT><DD> Files and locations (href's)\n<P>\n</DL>\n<P>\n<DT>Table of Contents.\n<DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents\n<DT>Specification.\n<DD> The system specification (requirements, design,\nmodule specs, code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and\ncontent to the outline provided for that phase.\nSections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked\n``N/A''.\n<DT>Minutes.\n<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by minutes of\nteam meetings held during the associated period of time.\n<DT>Performance Appraisals.\n<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied\nby performance appraisals.  Performance appraisals shall NOT be maintained\nas part of the project's web page.  A form is available at\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/appraisal.html\"> \nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/appraisal.html\n</a>.\n\n<DT>Project WebPage.\n<DD> The project deliverables, except as noted above,  shall be maintained\nin a project homepage.  \n</DL>\n\n<H3> Course Log</H3>\n<P>\nDuring your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your time\neither for you employer or to improve your own productivity.\nThroughout this course, you will practice doing this by keeping a\ncourse log recording the time you spend on all activities related to\nthis course.  At the beginning of each week you must hand in a copy of your log.\nThese logs are confidential and should be handed in independent of\nyour team's deliverable.  A log sheet is available at: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/logform.html\">\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/logform.html </a>.\nKeep your log as part of your individual home page, but password protect it.\n<hr>\n<p> OPTION: \nA better way than to submit the course logs (than each week in class)\nis be to have the form online in each of your home pages. Create a new one\neach week, and password protect the web pages in the following\nway:\n\n<br>--save the forms in a separate directory in your public_html directory\n<br>-- You place a file called .htaccess in the directory you want to protect.\nIt has the following sequence of commands in it:\n<p>\n\n<code>AuthUserFile <full path name of .htpasswd file>\n<br>AuthName ByPassword\n<br>AuthType Basic\n<br>\n<br>&ltLimit GET&gt\n<br>require user ics126\n<br>&lt/Limit&gt\n</code>\n\n<p>This means the user has to log in as ics126 and give the correct\npassword (which you will set) to be able to access the course log form.\nYou set the password in the .htpasswd file, be careful not to store the\n.htpasswd file in your public_html directory.\n\n<p>To create the .htpasswd file:\n\n<br>run the program <kbd>htpasswd</kbd>, to create it say,\n\n<br><kbd>htpasswd -c ~your_name/.htpasswd username</kbd>\n\n<br>and to add a password it is\n\n<br><kbd>htpasswd ~your_name/.htpasswd anotherusername</kbd>\n\n<br>assuming of course that the file you pointed to from .htaccess was\n~your_name/.htpasswd\n\n<p>Remember to have both .htpasswd and .htaccess as world readable. This\nshould do the trick, and you will be able to restrict access to your\ncourse log file. send in to taylor@ics and jaya@ics the password to give\naccess to your course log form. Keep the user name as \"ics126\".\nIf you have any problems with this, send mail to jaya@ics.uci.edu\n\n<hr>\n\n\n<P>\nEach entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry,\nand text describing the entry.  An entry is one of three types:\n<UL><LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;\n<LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;\n<LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.\n</UL>\n\n<p>\nMost entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should\nreflect and think about what is going on.\nThe time column applies for descriptions of activities and record the\namount of time spent in hours, to the quarter hour.\n\n<P>\nKeep a copy of your log.\nYou will be marked down only for failing to hand in logs with each phase,\nhanding in illegible logs, giving too little detail, or\nfailing to keep track of time spent.  \n\n<P>\nYou are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors\nyou make and the amount of time they consume.  The purpose of recording\nthese errors is so that you develop a better understanding of the\nkinds of mistakes you typically make.  With that understanding you\ncan improve your performance in the future, by paying extra attention\nto those areas in which you've had problems in the past.\n\n<hr>\n<H1> Team Composition, Activities,  and Peer Apportionment of Credit</H1>\n<P>\nAs discussed in class, teams will be assigned on as fair a basis as\npossible for the project.  The danger most students perceive in\nworking on projects with other students is in being saddled with (what\nthey think is) a \"non-producer\".  This is particularly true when\nyou don't get to choose all your teammates (the situation here).  Many\nfactors dictate the use of a multi-person project for this course.\nYou will not, after all, be able to choose your workmates in the\nfuture.  Therefore, to alleviate your concerns and to grade you\nappropriately, at the end of the term project you will be asked to\ndivide 100 points among the members of your project team,\ncorresponding to how you believe they contributed to the project as a\nwhole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish).  In addition, each\nteam member will be appraised for each phase.  This ``peer\napportionment of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate\nindividual grades for the project component.\n\n<H3> Team Organization</H3>\n<P>\nThere are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented.\nEnsure that there is adequate coordination among the team members.\nKnow each other's login names for electronic mail.\nKnow each other's phone numbers.\nMeet <b>at least once per week</b> (outside of class lecture)\nand preferably at the same,\npre-determined time each week (so as to avoid confusion).  The Discussion Section\nis designed to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone.\nHave an agenda for each meeting, which is determined by the manager.\n\n\n<p>\nHave a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even if\nthe responsible manager becomes unavailable.\nYou are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA\nabout your progress, problems, questions, etc.\n<P>\n<h3> Meetings</h3>\n<P>\nMeetings are an important part of a team project.\nA successful meeting requires that the meeting have a definite\npurpose and associated agenda (these are the responsibility of the\nphase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in minutes\n(the responsibility of the phase clerical person).\n<P>\nThe purpose of minutes is to record decisions made\nand to be available for updating any team member who misses a meeting.\nEach deliverable must be accompanied by agendas and minutes\nfor the team meetings held during the associated period of time.\nI.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project web page.\nThe minutes should outline\n<OL><LI> agenda for the meeting\n<LI> team members present and reason for any member's absence\n<LI> major design decisions discussed\n<LI> task assignments made\n<LI> future meetings scheduled\n</OL>\n\n\n\n<HR> \n<a name=\"costs\"></a>\n<H1> Cost and Benefits</H1>\n\n<p>\nThis course, like ICS 125,  will demand a lot, but I think that you may well find this\nto be the most rewarding courses that you will take in your\nundergraduate career.  ICS Alumni have said repeatedly that ICS 125 was\n<em> the most important </em> class that they took at UCI.  The\ntechniques presented in class actually work and will help you in future\nsoftware development.    Since 126 \"does 125\"  with a \"double helping\"\nit should be even more popular.\n\n<p>\nAt the end of the class I encourge you to make copies of your\nproject website/notebook for each team member.  Take them with you when\nyou go to a job interview.  Students from past ICS 125 classes\nhave frequently said that it was their project notebook that \nclinched a job for them.  Some interviewers have commented that \nthe quality of the process followed by the ICS 125 teams and the\nquality of the product exceeds those of the production engineers\nin their companies.  Since ICS 126 should be even more realistic and \nin-depth than 125 I suspect employers will be even more impressed!\n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"TA\"></a>\n<H1> Teaching Assistant </H1>\n<ul>     \n<li> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jaya/\"> Jaya Vaidyanathan </a>     -->\nSend mail to:      -->\n<A HREF=\"mailto:jaya@ics.uci.edu\">      jaya@ics.uci.edu </A>     -->\n</ul>     -->\n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"touch\"></a>\n<H1> Keeping in Touch </H1>\nRead the ics.126 bboard regularly.
