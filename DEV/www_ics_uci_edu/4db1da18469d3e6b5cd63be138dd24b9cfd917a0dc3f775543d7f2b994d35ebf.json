Curves are often misaligned in \n    real-world data sets. For example, the growth acceleration curves for \n    a set of boys might share a common shape or structure due to similarities \n    in human growth development but may be significantly misaligned due to \n    differences in individual growth dynamics. Clustering and prediction in \n    this situation can be difficult.\n \n    <p>With this type of curve data, typically one of two sequential strategies \n    is followed: (1) clustering is followed by a within-cluster alignment, \n    or (2) the curves are first aligned globally and then clustering is carried \n    out on the aligned curves. Both of these methods are potentially suboptimal \n    since the clustering and alignment are often dependent on each other. The \n    joint clustering-alignment models in this toolbox address this problem by \n    simultaneously solving both the clustering and alignment problems using a \n    joint EM framework.\n\n\n\n<h3>Standard regression mixture model specification</h3>\n    <p>The general model specification used throughout this toolbox is based\n    on the standard polynomial regression model:\n             <div class=\"math\">y = XB + e,</div>\n    <p>where <span class=math>y</span> is an observed curve, <span class=math>X</span> \n    is the associated regression matrix, <span class=math>B</span> is\n    a vector of regression coefficients, and <span class=math>e</span> is an error \n    term (zero-mean\n    Gaussian). In the case of splines, <span class=math>X</span> is a spline basis \n    matrix and <span class=math>y</span> is the\n    spline coefficient vector. \n \n    <p>If you repeat this model over <span class=mathi>K</span> cluster components \n    (or groups), then the\n    resulting overall density of <span class=math>y</span> can be described \n    by a linear regression \n    mixture (LRM) model. (Some authors may choose to call this a polynomial \n    regression mixture (PRM) model if <span class=math>y</span> is a polynomial \n    in <span class=math>x</span>, but we just\n    stick with the notation LRM in this toolbox.) The mixture density \n    for <span class=math>y</span>\n    can be written as\n\n    <div class=\"math\">\n              <em>p</em>(y|<em>Q</em>) = \\sum_<em>k w_k N</em>(y|<em>Q_k</em>),</div>\n              \n    <p>where <span class=mathi>Q</span> and <span class=mathi>Q_k</span> \n    denote an appropriate set of \n    parameters for the particular\n    chosen error model (Gaussian), <span class=mathi>w_k</span> is the \n    <span class=mathi>k</span>-th mixture weight, \n    and <span class=mathi>N</span>() is\n    the Gaussian density (note: \\sum_<span class=mathi>k</span> is just a sum \n    indexed from 1 to <span class=mathi>K</span>).\n    There is a straightforward EM procedure to estimate <span class=mathi>Q</span> \n    and determine the\n    cluster memberships for each <span class=math>y</span>-curve. The EM procedure iterates\n    between estimating the cluster memberships and solving <span class=mathi>K</span> weighted\n    least-squares problems. The algorithm for this procedure is contained in the\n    function <b>lrm()</b> for this toolbox. The function <b>curve_clust()</b> provides a\n    standard calling interface that should be used to call this and all other \n    EM algorithms in this toolbox.\n\n\n\n    <h3>Curve-aligned clustering model specification</h3>\n  \n    <p>In brief overview, simultaneous curve alignment and clustering is accounted\n    for by adding (at most) four scalar transformation variables to the above \n    regression mixtures specification. We denote these variables by \n    <span class=mathi>a,b,c</span>, \n    and <span class=mathi>d</span>. \n    Below we refer to <span class=math>x</span> as time (and refer to transformations in time) \n    and <span class=math>y</span> as \n    the measurements (and refer to transformations in measurement space).\n    The transformed regression model can be written as\n \n             <div class=\"math\">y = <em>c</em>[<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>]B + <em>d</em> + e,</div>\n \n    <p>where the square brackets '[' and ']' denote the transformed regression\n    matrix (discussed below). The variable <span class=mathi>c</span> \n    allows for scaling in measurement\n    space, <span class=mathi>d</span> allows for translation in measurement space, \n    <span class=mathi>a</span> allows for scaling\n    in time, and <span class=mathi>b</span> allows for translation in time. \n    This can be rewritten to more\n    clearly separate the actions of <span class=mathi>a,b</span> and \n    <span class=mathi>c,d</span>:\n    <div class=\"math\">\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n            <tr><td align=\"center\">(y-<em>d</em>)<td colspan=\"2\">\n            <tr><td>-----  <td>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<td>[<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>]B + e*,<br>\n            <tr><td align=\"center\"><em>c</em><td colspan=\"2\">\n    </table>\n    </div>\n \n    <p>where <span class=math>e*</span> is a new error term. \n    From this equation it is clear that <span class=mathi>c</span> \n    and <span class=mathi>d</span>\n    \"operate\" on <span class=math>y</span> (in measurement space), \n    and <span class=mathi>a</span> and <span class=mathi>b</span> \"operate\" \n    on <span class=math>x</span> (in time).\n \n    <p>The transformed regression matrix \n    <span class=math>[<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>]</span> can be computed \n    by applying the\n    transformation <span class=math><em>a</em>x+<em>b</em></span> \n    to the observation times before \n    the regression matrix \n    is built. The standard regression matrix in polynomial regression is the\n    Vandermonde matrix:\n    <div class=\"math\">\n            X = (1  x  x^2  x^3 ... x^<em>p</em>),</div>\n \n    <p>where <span class=math>x = (<em>x</em>_1,<em>x</em>_2,...,<em>x_n</em>)</span>' \n    and <span class=math>x^<em>m</em></span> is \n    the vector <span class=math>x</span> whose <span class=mathi>n</span> components are\n    each raised to the power <span class=mathi>m</span>. Thus, in this case, \n    <span class=math>X</span> is an <span class=math><em>n-by-</em>(<em>p+1</em>)</span>\n    regression matrix. Using this notation we can easily describe \n    <span class=math>[<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>]</span> as follows:\n    <div class=\"math\">\n         [<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>] = (1  <em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>  (<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>)^2  \n         (<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>)^3  ...  (<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>)^<em>p</em>),</div>\n \n    <p>where <span class=math>(<em>a</em>x+<em>b</em>)^<em>m</em></span>\n    is the vector <span class=math><em>a</em>x+<em>b</em></span>\n    whose <span class=mathi>n</span> components are each raised to the power\n    <span class=mathi>m</span>.\n \n    <p>If we repeat the transformed regression model for \n    <span class=math>y</span> over <span class=mathi>K</span> cluster components,\n    then the resulting overall density for <span class=math>y</span> \n    is a curve-aligned regression\n    mixture model. A set of linear EM algorithms (linear in the number of curve \n    measurements) that simultaneously solves for cluster memberships and curve\n    alignments for this model was introduced in (Gaffney, 04). These joint\n    clustering-alignment EM algorithms make up the body of what the CCToolbox\n    provides. The set of cluster models/methods provided in this toolbox\n    are described in the <a href=\"cluster_models.html\">cluster models</a> section.\n\n\n<h3></h3>\n<div align=center>\n<a href=\"#top\">Top</a> |\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sgaffney/software/CCT\">CCToolbox</a> |\n<a href=\"../#Down\">Download</a> |\n<a href=\"./\">Documentation</a> |\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sgaffney#contact\">Contact</a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
