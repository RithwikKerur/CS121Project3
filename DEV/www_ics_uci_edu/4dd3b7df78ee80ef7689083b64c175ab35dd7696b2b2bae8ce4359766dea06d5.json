this\r  is broken down between deliverables, a team Web page, and presentations. The <strong>approximately</strong> remaining\r  20% will be divided among individual course logs, teamwork, individual leadership\r  demonstrated, and the final. These are guidelines intended to help students\r  plan their work in this course. However, the instructor does reserve the<br>\r  right to make changes in these evaluation criteria.A critcal aspect of success,\r  however, and thus of assessment, is an effectively functioning team. Just because\r  a team's code &quot;works&quot; at the end of the quarter does not mean that\r  they have earned an A. If the team did a poor job on the requirements and design,\r  for instance, their grade would be much lower, despite &quot;working&quot; code.\r  Put another way, if your team has to pull an all-nighter to get a working system,\r  in all likelihood you will not receive the grade you want. \r<h4> Deliverables</h4>\rThe  project nominally consists of five major assignments. The relative\rweighting of each deliverable, intended to provide you with some guidance as\rto how much effort should be devoted to these tasks, and how much importance\rI ascribe to them, is indicated in the table below along with the due date, or\rapproximate due date. The on-line versions of the assignments may still be under\rconstruction (watch the\r&quot;what's new&quot;\rsection to see when they are available). <br>\r&nbsp; <br>\r&nbsp;\r<center>\r  <table BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 >\r    <tr ALIGN=LEFT>\r      <td width=\"199\"><b>Deliverable/Schedule Item</b></td>\r      <td width=\"53\"><b>Weight&nbsp;</b></td>\r      <td width=\"506\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\"><b>Description </b></td>\r      <td width=\"262\"><b>Due Date (subject to change) </b></td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">Individual Web Page</div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>&nbsp;</td>\r      <td>January 13th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">\r        <ul>\r          Teams Designated\r        </ul>\r      </div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>January 9th</td>\r      <td>&nbsp;</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">\r        <ul>\r          Projects Selected/Assigned\r        </ul>\r      </div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>January 9th</td>\r      <td>&nbsp;</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">Team Web Page</div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>&nbsp;</td>\r      <td>January 15th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">Prospectus and Plan&nbsp;</div></td>\r      <td><center>\r        10&nbsp;\r      </center></td>\r      <td><a href=\"prospectus.html\">Prospectus&nbsp;</a></td>\r      <td>January 20th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">\r        <ul>\r          Prospectus Reviews\r        </ul>\r      </div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>week 3</td>\r      <td>&nbsp;</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">Requirements Specification</div></td>\r      <td><center>\r        15&nbsp;\r      </center></td>\r      <td><a href=\"requirements.html\">Requirements</a></td>\r      <td>January 29th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">\r        <ul>\r          Requirements Reviews\r        </ul>\r      </div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>week 4</td>\r      <td>January 27th and/or 29th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">Architecture/Module Specifications&nbsp;</div></td>\r      <td><center>\r        20&nbsp;\r      </center></td>\r      <td><a href=\"design.html\">Architecture/Design</a></td>\r      <td>February 12th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">\r        <ul>\r          Design Reviews\r        </ul>\r      </div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>Week 6</td>\r      <td>February 12th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">Implementation&nbsp;</div></td>\r      <td><center>\r        20&nbsp;\r      </center></td>\r      <td><a href=\"implementation.html\">Implementation/1st demonstration </a></td>\r      <td>&nbsp;</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">\r        <ul>\r          Code Reviews/Demos\r        </ul>\r      </div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>week 9</td>\r      <td>March 5th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">Testing/Test Documentation</div></td>\r      <td><div align=\"center\">15&nbsp;</div></td>\r      <td><a href=\"integration-test.html\">Implementation/2nd demonstration/Quality\r          Assurance Report</a> </td>\r      <td>March 12th</td>\r    </tr>\r    <tr>\r      <td><div align=\"left\">\r        <ul>\r          Demonstrations\r        </ul>\r      </div></td>\r      <td>.</td>\r      <td>week 10 + finals week (TBD) </td>\r      <td>&nbsp;</td>\r    </tr>\r  </table>\r</center>\r<p> Variations on this schedule may be made to accommodate the particular needs\r  of a given project or a given team. Also, note that a team's grade for a phase\r  is a function not only of the document/specification developed but also of\r  any associated test plan and any reviews conducted in class, with the instructor,\r  with the TA, or with the customer.\r<p>Have questions about your intellectual property rights (IPR)?

NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS\r  WILL BE ACCEPTED. This applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.\r  Since you are working in this class as part of team, it is the <strong>team's</strong> responsibility\r  to ensure that assignments are turned in on time. Normal excuses for late assignments,\r  such as illness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone\r  on the team is ill :-)\r  \r<h4> Deliverable Reviews</h4>\rEach deliverable will be reviewed, some reviews will be conducted before the\rwhole class.\r<p> Your customer should be invited to your team's Prospectus and Requirements\r  review as well as your demonstration (and, possibly even your design and code\r  reviews depending on the nature of your customer).&nbsp; The review is your\r  team's chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas from all relevant\r  parties; your document will be reviewed at this time by course staff and clients\r  as well as the rest of the class.&nbsp; This review is formal, however, and\r  each team should have presented and negotiated both relevant documents to the\r  customer prior to the review (if you haven't, it may be unpleasantly obvious\r  by the interactions at this time).\r  \r<h3> Document Requirements</h3>\r<P> All the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral parts\r  of systematic software development. Their continued, up-to-date existence is\r  necessary for successful system development. <b>Do not delete</b> documents\r  after they have been turned in. They must reside permanently on your team's\r  website.\r<P> All deliverable documents, with the exception of performance appraisals as\r  discussed below, must be prepared on-line and be available as part of your\r  project home page either as either HTML or .pdf files. NO MS Word files. In\r  general, the following should be observed.\r<DL>\r  <dl>\r    <dt><strong>Cover \"page\".</strong></dt>\r  </dl>\r  <dd> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving:  </dd>\r</dl>\r<DL><DL><DD> Project title\r    <DT>    \r    <DD> Development phase and deliverable\r    <DT>    \r    <DD> Date\r    <DT>    \r    <DD> Team name/number\r    <DT>    \r    <DD> Team members\r    <DT>    \r    <DD> Phase manager\r    <DT>    \r    <DD>\r    \r    <DT>    \r    <DD> Files and locations (href's)\r  </DL>\r  <br>\r  <dl>\r    <DT> <strong>Table of Contents. </strong>\r    <DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents\r    <DT><strong>Specification</strong>.\r    <DD> The system specification (requirements, architecture, module specs,\r      code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and content to the\r      outline provided for that phase.

The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to use the\r  techniques and so that you do not implement something from a bad design or\r  specification. You should keep the same responsibilities for the improvement\r  phase but assign new responsibilities for the next phase.\r  \r  \r<H3> Course Log</H3>\r<P> During your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your time\r  either for you employer or to improve your own productivity. Throughout this\r  course, you will practice doing this by keeping a course log recording the\r  time you spend on all activities related to this course. At the beginning of\r  each week you must submit the previous week's log to the TA. A sheet showing\r  what should be on the log <a href=\"logform.html\">is\r  available</a>. The first log you submit will cover <em>Week\r  Two</em>;  it will be submitted\r  at the beginning of <em>Week Three</em>.\r<p> Keep a copy of your logs: you will need them at the end of the quarter for\r  the final review.  \r  \r<P> Each entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry, and\r  text describing the entry. An entry is one of three types:\r<UL>\r  <LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;\r  <LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;\r  <LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.\r</UL>\r<p> Most entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should reflect\r  and think about what is going on. The time entry applies for descriptions of\r  activities and records the amount of time spent in hours, to the nearest quarter\r  hour.\r  \r<P> You will be marked down only for failing to submit logs each week, <strong>giving\r  too little detail</strong>, or failing to keep track of time spent.  \r<P> You are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors you make\r  and the amount of time they consume. The purpose of recording these errors\r  is so that you develop a better understanding of the kinds of mistakes you\r  typically make. With that understanding you can improve your performance in\r  the future, by paying extra attention to those areas in which you've had problems\r  in the past.\r<h2><font color=\"#990000\">Summary of what you turn in, and when:</font></h2>\r<ol>\r  <li><font color=\"#990000\">Weekly, by individual, using a dropbox: course log\r      for preceding week.</font></li>\r  <li><font color=\"#990000\">Per deliverable, by team, on website: deliverable\r      documents.</font></li>\r  <li><font color=\"#990000\">Per deliverable, by team, on paper, performance appraisals.\r      Exception: <strong>not</strong> required for the Prospectus.</font></li>\r  <li><font color=\"#990000\">End of quarter, by individual, on paper: collection\r      of the course logs for the quarter.</font></li>\r  <li><font color=\"#990000\">End of quarter, by individual, on paper, &quot;peer\r      apportionment of credit&quot;</font></li>\r</ol>\r<hr>\r<h3> Team Composition, Activities, and Peer Apportionment of Credit</h3>\r<h4>How will teams be composed? </h4>\rEach team will have 3 to 5 people. I will attempt to balance a team's aggregate\rexpertise with the needs of a particular project. I will also attempt to accommodate\rsome personal preferences for teammates. The <a href=\"survey.html\">course survey\rform</a>, which you will turn in on the first week of class, is a key instrument\rin assigning the teams. In the end however, I make all the assignments, both\rof team composition and of project.\r<H3>&nbsp;</H3>\r<P>The danger most students perceive in working on projects with other students\r  is being saddled with (what they think is) a \"non-producer\". This is particularly\r  true when you don't get to choose all your teammates (the situation here).\r  Many factors dictate the use of a multi-person project for this course. You\r  will not, after all, be able to choose your workmates in the future. One thing\r  we'll discuss in the class is how to fix dysfunctional teams. Nonetheless,\r  to alleviate your concerns and to grade you appropriately, at the end of the\r  term project you will be asked to divide 100 points among the members of your\r  project team, excluding yourself, corresponding to how you believe they contributed\r  to the project as a whole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish). In addition,\r  each team member will be appraised for each phase. This ``peer apportionment\r  of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate individual grades for\r  the project component.\r  \r<H3> Team Organization</H3>\r<P> There are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented.\r  Ensure that there is adequate coordination among the team members. Know each\r  other's login names for electronic mail. Know each other's phone numbers. Meet <b>at\r  least twice per week</b> (outside of class lecture) at the same, pre-determined\r  time each week (so as to avoid confusion). The Discussion Section is designed\r  to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone. You are strongly\r  urged to use that time slot.\r  \r<p> Have a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even if the responsible\r  manager becomes unavailable.\r  \r<p> You are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA\r  about your progress, problems, questions, etc.\r  \r<h3> Meetings</h3>\r<P> Meetings are an important part of a team project. A successful meeting requires\r  that the meeting have a definite purpose and associated agenda (these are the\r  responsibility of the phase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in\r  minutes (the responsibility of the phase clerical person).\r<P> The purpose of minutes is to record decisions made and to be available for\r  updating any team member who misses a meeting. Each deliverable must be accompanied\r  by agendas and minutes for the team meetings held during the associated period\r  of time. I.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project\r  web page. The minutes should outline\r<OL>\r  <LI> Date, time began, time ended \r  <LI>agenda for the meeting\r  <LI> team members present and reason for any member's absence\r  <LI> major design decisions discussed\r  <LI> task assignments made (i.e. action items) \r  <LI>open issues\r  <LI>questions to be asked and plan for getting them answered \r  <LI> future meetings scheduled\r  <LI>topics for next meeting. \r</OL>\r<hr width=\"100%\">\r\r\r<h3><font face=\"Verdana\"><a\rname=\"policies\"></a>Policies</font></h3>\r\r<p><strong>What's the Drop/Add policy? </strong>Since Informatics 117 has a strong\r  team project orientation, it is essential that the drop/add process be terminated\r  early.
