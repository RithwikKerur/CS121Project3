While the occasional misplaced comma or grammatical\nmisstep will pass beneath our notice, work whose clear expression is obscured\nby multiple flaws will receive a lower score.  In HCI terms, the usability\nprinciple of adhering to standards and conventions dictates that your prose\nwriting follow these norms.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>It&#39;s a good idea to have close at hand\na paperback English dictionary and a writing guide (such as <I>Writing from\nA to Z</I> by Ebest et al., which is used in lower-division writing courses\nat UCI).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Assignment submission and illustrations:\n </B>Where possible, we&#39;d prefer that you submit your work completely\nin electronic form using Checkmate (<A NAME=\"_14_1935\"></A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>;\nsee below).  We also encourage you to use illustrations in your work whenever\nthey make your point effectively.  You should try, where you can, to produce\nthose illustrations on line and incorporate them into your electronic documents.\n We recognize, though, that few computer-based tools are as quick and convenient\nas a hand-drawn sketch.  Appropriate hand-drawn sketches are far better\nthan nothing, so if you find a situation that needs illustration but where\ncomputer-based illustration would be impractical, you may submit a paper\nversion of your assignment (at the time and place we designate) and the\nhandwritten illustrations won&#39;t lower your score.  In those cases, please\nalso submit an electronic version via Checkmate (with some notation like\n&quot;illustration supplied on paper version&quot; where the hand-drawn\nillustrations would go).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>If you plan to submit an assignment on paper,\neither deliver it to the TA in section or submit it by the deadline to the\nICS Distribution Center (whose hours are available at <A NAME=\"_14_2982\"></A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/academics/sao/distribution/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/academics/sao/distribution/</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>).\n</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>If you don&#39;t know how to take a screen\nshot on whatever system(s) you use and paste those images into a document,\nnow&#39;s the time to find out.  In most cases, producing a snapshot of\nan actual existing screen is quicker than sketching the relevant details\nby hand, so the screen shot is what you should use.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>To get set up for electronic submission, go\nto <A NAME=\"_14_3396\"></A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>,\nlog in with your UCInet ID, choose &quot;Course Listing&quot; for &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Palatino\">Winter</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\n</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Minion Web\" SIZE=4>2004</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>,&quot;\nclick &quot;Go&quot; next to </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Palatino\">ICS 104</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>,\nand then click &quot;List me for this course.&quot;  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Plagiarism--don&#39;t do it:</B>  Plagiarism\nmeans presenting somebody else&#39;s work as if it&#39;s your own.  You\nmay use whatever outside sources (books, friends, interviews, periodicals)\nare appropriate for an assignment, so long as you cite them:  Any time you\nuse two or more words in a row that you didn&#39;t think up and write yourself,\nyou must put the words in quotation marks and indicate where they came from.\n (There could be situations where this two-word rule isn&#39;t appropriate.\n If you think you have one, check with us.)  Even if you paraphrase (state\nin your own words) someone else&#39;s work or ideas, you should cite the\nsource (e.g., &quot;Dijkstra says that unrestricted branching is dangerous.&quot;).\n Plagiarism is academically dishonest, and we expect that nobody in the\nclass will engage in it.  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>That should be enough said, but unfortunately\nthere have been instances of plagiarism in these courses in the past.  We\nwill check for it both manually and by using software that compares students&#39;\nwork with work from other sources, including the Internet and work submitted\nin previous quarters.  ICS department policy is that plagiarists fail the\ncourse and have their offense recorded in the department office.  Academic\nhonesty violations can affect a student&#39;s graduation, financial aid,\nand eligibility for honors.  The department deals with plagiarism cases\nevery quarter, even though most people don&#39;t hear about them.  No matter\nhow pressured you feel, don&#39;t plagiarize; it&#39;s not worth it.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
