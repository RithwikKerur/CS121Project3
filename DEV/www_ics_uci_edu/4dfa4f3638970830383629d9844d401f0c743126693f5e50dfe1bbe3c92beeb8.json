The question pertains to packings with a co-compact or\n&gt;co-finite symmetry group, which have a well-defined density after\n&gt;passing to the quotient of the group action.  If you like, you can say\n&gt;that good hyperbolic packing of C is an arrangement with disjoint\n&gt;interiors of isometric copies of C on a complete, finite-area,\n&gt;hyperbolic surface.)\n&gt;\n&gt;Does anyone know whether this problem is actually open?\n\nThe answer is no.  A counterexample is the epsilon neighborhood of a\nline segment of length L, as epsilon -&gt; 0 and L is say 1/epsilon.  Call\nthis shape B.  In any packing of copies of B, consider the Voronoi\ndiagram.\n\nIt's not hard to see that for any copy of B, if the Voronoi cell is\ncompact, the number of Voronoi neighbors is large if epsilon is small:\nThat's because for any two lines that are distance at least 2 epsilon\napart, the orthogonal projection of one line to the other has length\nO(-log(epsilon)); the same goes for their Voronoi interface, which is a\nline epsilon distance from either.  The projection is even shorter if\none line segment \"sees\" another end-on instead of broadside.  Thus,\nsince each Voronoi neighbor blocks only a relatively short portion of\nthe perimeter, the number of Voronoi neighbors is large.\n\nConsider any compact surface packed with copies of B.  Construct\nthe dual cell-division to the Voronoi diagram (the Delaunay triangulation).\nThe ratio of edges to vertices is large.  This implies the ratio of\nEuler characteristic to #vertices = #copies of B is large.  But the\narea of B is approximately 2, so the packing efficiency goes to 0.\n\n\tBill Thurston    <A HREF=\"mailto:wpt@math.berkeley.edu\">wpt@math.berkeley.edu</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
