They called \r\nhim R.Leibish.\r\n\r\nI can go only up to R. Shmuel Yaakov Langsam. I'm missing the link \r\nbetween R. Shmuel Yaakov and R. Chaim Leib.\r\n\r\nR.Shmuel Yaakov had 3 known children : Efraim, Chaya Breindl, Sima Reizl.\r\n \r\nEfraim Langsam had 4 children : Leib, Henia (married Pinchevsky), \r\nShloime, Abraham.\r\n         Henia has also 4 children : Shmuel, Aharon, Faya, Feige.\r\n\r\nSima Reizl married to R.Yakov Hacohen Taubenfeld and had 5 children :\r\nShimon, Faya (called Pepka married Gerblich), Shaindl (married Shnaid), \r\nMendel, Fraide.\r\n\r\n         R.Shimon (1894-1983) married Ettil Toraschreiber (1891-1980) and \r\n\t\t had one daughter Esther Lea\r\n                 Esther Lea (1927-1978) married R.Yaakov Koppel Friedberg \r\n\t\t\t\t and have 4 children: Mirel Reizl (married Yoshua Gottlieb),\r\n\t\t\t\t Rivka (married Boruch Menachem Kaufman), Dov Yitschok \r\n\t\t\t\t (married Esther Schwartz), Devorah Shaindl (married Moishe \r\n\t\t\t\t Avrohom Pariser).\r\n \r\nR.Shimon and his parents lived in Bircza. Also, R.Shimon called himself Langsam. \r\nDo You have any info about the Langsam's from Bircza ? The Ronald S. Lauder \r\nFoundation in Warsaw told me that there is just under 100 stones in Bircza but \r\nthey have not been indexed. The LDS (mormones) have no Jewish records from Bircza.\r\n\r\nIf You can puzzle out something, especially the link between Shmuel Yaakov and \r\nChaim Leib, please write me.\r\n\r\nThank You very much.\r\n\r\nKesiva vachasima tova and Hatzlocho Rabo\r\n\r\n\r\nMoishe Pariser\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: moishe@langsam.com \r\nTo: Pariser \r\nSent: Tuesday, August 27, 2002 07:13\r\nSubject: Re: jichus\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat makes you think that you come from R.Chaim Leib Langsam?\r\n\r\nMoishe\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Pariser\" &lt;moishepariser@skynet.be>\r\nSubject: Re: jichus\r\nDate: Tue, 27 Aug 2002 10:54:15 +0200\r\nTo: &lt;moishe@langsam.com>  \r\n\r\nGood morning\r\n \r\nRav Chaim Kreizwirth zt\"l, the Rov of Antwerp, told me that my wife's \r\ngrandfather R.Shimon Langsam used to say that he is a einikel of R.Leibish \r\nthe brother of the Benei Yissoschor\r\n \r\nMoishe\r\n______________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: \"Suzan & Ron Wynne\" <srwynne@erols.com>\r\nTo: <moish@langsam.com>\r\nSent: Friday, June 04, 2004 11:47 AM\r\nSubject: H17\r\n\r\n\r\nMoishe,\r\nThe Jaroslaw records are quite a goldmine! I didn't think that we \r\nwould learn much from them but I was mistaken. I'm glad that I paid \r\nthe money to get the indexed database.\r\n\r\nMy latest connections: I was able to document some of the people on \r\nMoshe Pariser's wife's branch. The children for Sara Reisel Langsam \r\nand Jakob Taubenfeld were documented. Paje Langsam was born in 1895 \r\nin Pruchnik. She married Aron Samuel Gerblich in 1922. Aron was the \r\nson of Chaim Gerblich and Ryfka Frostman. Sara Reisel and Jakob's \r\nother child in the database was Frieda. She was born in 1906 in \r\nBircza. In 1930, she married Herman Susskind, born 1903 in Rzeszow \r\nto Aron Susskind and Sara Storch.\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 7/27/04</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
