Our scheme ensures correctness of escrows as long as at least one \r\n\tof the participating parties is honest, and it ensures privacy and anonymity of \r\n\ttransactions even if the escrow agent is corrupt or malicious. The escrowed \r\n\tinformation is secret and anonymous, but the escrow agent can efficiently find \r\n\ttransactions involving some user in response to a subpoena or a search warrant. \r\n\tMoreover, for applications such as abuse-resilient monitoring of unusually high \r\n\tlevels of certain transactions, the escrow agent can identify escrows with \r\n\tparticular common characteristics and automatically (i.e., without a subpoena) \r\n\topen them once their number has reached a pre-specified threshold. Our solution \r\n\tfor transaction escrow is based on the use of Verifiable Random Functions. We \r\n\tshow that by <EM>tagging</EM> the entries in the escrow database using VRFs \r\n\tindexed by users' private keys, we can protect users' anonymity while enabling \r\n\tefficient and, optionally, automatic de-escrow of these entries. We give a \r\n\tpractical instantiation of a transaction escrow scheme utilizing a simple and \r\n\tefficient VRF family secure under the DDH assumption in the Random Oracle \r\n\tModel.\r\n</P>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
