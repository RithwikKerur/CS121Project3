The sensor readings are reported to a database system, and are subsequently\r\nused to answer queries. Due to continuous changes in these values and limited resources (e.g., network\r\nbandwidth and battery power), the database may not be able to keep track of the actual values\r\nof the entities. Queries that use these old values may produce incorrect answers. However, if the\r\ndegree of uncertainty between the actual data value and the database value is limited, one can place\r\nmore confidence in the answers to the queries. More generally, query answers can be augmented with\r\nprobabilistic guarantees of the validity of the answers. In this paper, we study probabilistic query\r\nevaluation based on uncertain data. A classification of queries is made based upon the nature of the\r\nresult set. For each class, we develop algorithms for computing probabilistic answers, and provide\r\nefficient indexing and numeric solutions. We address the important issue of measuring the quality of\r\nthe answers to these queries, and provide algorithms for efficiently pulling data from relevant sensors\r\nor moving objects in order to improve the quality of the executing queries. Extensive experiments\r\nare performed to examine the effectiveness of several data update policies.\r\n</p>  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n<H3>Keywords:</H3> Sensor databases, \r\n\t\t\tquerying imprecise data, \r\n            uncertainty, \r\n            uncertainty region, \r\n            handling uncertainty, \r\n            models of uncertainty, \r\n            aggregate query,   \r\n            entity-based query, \r\n            value-based query, \r\n            probabilistic queries, \r\n            quality of probabilistic answer, \r\n            update heuristics, \r\n            location-aware computing,  \r\n</p>  \r\n<BR>\r\n  \r\n<p>  \r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3>\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/IS07_dvk_pqry.pdf\">IS07_dvk_pqry.pdf</A><BR> \r\nSee also a <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/TKDE04_dvk.html\">moving-object environment solution</A> to a similar problem.  \r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?IS07_dvk_pqry\" width=1 height=1>  \r\n</p>  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3> \r\n<pre>@article{IS07::dvkPQ,\r\n   author    = {Reynold Cheng and Dmitri V.\\ Kalashnikov and Sunil Prabhakar},\r\n   title     = {Evaluation of Probabilistic Queries over Imprecise Data in Constantly-Evolving Environments},\r\n   journal   = IS,\r\n   volume    = 32,\r\n   number    = 1,\r\n   pages     = {104--130},\r\n   month     = mar,    \r\n   year      = 2007\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/index.html\">Back to Kalashnikov's homepage</A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR> \r\n</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
