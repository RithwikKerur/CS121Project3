The paper presents a  technique for\nparallelizing a strictly defined class of functions within the MRC\nmodel by decomposing such functions into map and reduce operations\nimplementable within MPC. This technique is used to prove that any\nconcurrent read exclusive write parallel random access machine (CREW\nPRAM) can be efficiently run on a system implementing MapReduce if\nthe\nmemory/processor constraints of their model are satisfied. Lastly,\nthe\nresearchers show that in some cases more efficient MRC algorithms may\nbe designed than existing algorithms in PRAMs.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
