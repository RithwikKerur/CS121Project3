In this talk, I will explore three natural setups for modeling noise\nassociated with input data/metric. Specifically, (i) the input data could already\nbe embedded in a metric space, but the embedding may be noisy; or (ii) we are\ngiven a noisy discrete n-point metric as input which could include outliers; and\nwe aim to remove these outliers and embed remaining points to a target metric\nspace with low distortion; or (iii) the target metric is induced from an input\ngraph which itself is noisy, leading to noisy graph metrics. I will describe the\nspecific noise model in each setup and present denoising approaches for each case\nto recover the metric information with theoretical guarantees. Our methods draw\nideas from computational geometry, theoretical computer science and statistical\nmodeling. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Brief Bio</b>:   \nYusu Wang is Associate Professor of Computer Science and Engineering\nDepartment at the Ohio State University. She obtained her PhD degree from Duke\nUniversity, where she received the Best PhD Dissertation Award at CS Dept., Duke\nU, in 2004. Before joining OSU in 2005, she was a post-doctoral fellow at\nStanford University from 2004--2005. Yusu Wang works in the fields of\nComputational geometry and Computational topology. She is primarily interested in\ndeveloping effective and theoretically justified algorithms for data / shape\nanalysis using geometric and topological ideas and methods, and in applying them\nto practical domains, including computational biology, computer graphics and\nvisualization. She received DOE Early Career Principal Investigator Award in\n2006, NSF Career Award in 2008, and several best paper awards, including the Best\nPaper award in SIGSPATIAL GIS 2015 and the Mark Fulk Best Student Paper award in\nCOLT 2015.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
