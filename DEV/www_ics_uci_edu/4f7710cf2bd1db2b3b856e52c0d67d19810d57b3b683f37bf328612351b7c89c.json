They are played on a square matrix and the players \nalternately mark a previously unmarked cell with a player-specific \nsymbol [as in noughts-and-crosses = tick-tack-toe]. A player wins if\nhe forms a congruent copy [reflections are allowed] of a specified \n\"animal\" [a.k.a. \"polyomino\"] of cells all marked with his symbol.\n\nBy the usual strategy-stealing argument, with optimal play the game\nmust be either a first-player win or a draw, so it's only fair to\ncount a draw as a second-player win. In fact there's a variant in\nwhich all the second player does is to try to stop the first player \nforming the animal: she doesn't win by forming one herself. An animal\nwhich can be achieved by the first player on a sufficiently large \nboard is a \"winner\", one that he cannot form is a \"loser\".\n\nThe main result mentioned in [MG1] and [WW] is that there are just\ntwelve animals that are winners:\n\n  *    *-*   *-*-*   *-*   *-*-*-*   *-*-*    *-*-*   *-*\n                       *                 *      *       *-*\n\n  *-*-*-*    *-*-*-*   *-*-*      *-*-*-*\n        *        *         *-*          *-*\n\nWell, maybe \"result\" isn't quite the right word, as although the\nHales-Jewett pairings shown in [MG1] and [WW] certainly prove all\nother animals losers [although note that both these specify the\nsame wrong pairing for demonstrating that\n\n      *-*-*-*\n      *     *\n\nis a loser - e.g. see [MG2]], the status of the final hexomino\n(named \"Snaky\" by Harary) is admitted to be uncertain, [MG1]\nsaying that it is \"believed\" that a first-player win in 13 moves \non a 15x15 board is possible, and [WW] giving the same numbers\nbut succinctly adding the caveat \"but Snaky is a bit shaky\".\n\nQ1. Surely someone has settled this one way or the other by now,\n    if only by brute force computation? \n\n[MG1] and [WW] both give minimum numbers of moves (m) and minimum\nboard sizes (b for a bxb board) for the winners. These don't agree,\nfor at least two reasons: \n\n 1. There is a difference between \n    a) m_1, the minimum number of moves to win on an infinite board, \n       and b_1, the minimum size of board in which one can win in \n       m_1 moves; and\n    b) b_2, the minimum size of board on which it is possible to win,\n       and m_2, the minimum number of moves necessary to win on such\n       a board.\n    [MG1] is trying to give (b); [WW] (without making it very clear)\n    seems to be attempting (a).\n 2. Some entries are just wrong. E.g. [MG1] gives (b=4,m=5) for the\n    Z-shaped tetromino, [WW] correctly gives (b=3,m=5) [correctly\n    according to either (a) or (b), in this case]. To add to the\n    confusion, in [MG2] Gardner writes \"for the 4-cell animal Knobby\n    [the T-shaped tetromino] the move number is 4, not 5\" -- but\n    [MG1] already correctly [I think] gave (b=5,m=4) for this animal!\n\nQ2. Has anyone worked out the correct optimal (boardsize,moves) values\n    for each winning animal?\n\nThere are all sorts of potential variations: triangular or hexagonal\ngrids, 3-dimensional grids, games in which the players try to make\ndifferent animals, games in which they try to avoid making specific\nanimals, etc., etc. In [MG1] Gardner writes \"Harary is planning a book\non achievement and avoidance games in which all these generalisations\nof ticktacktoe and many other closely related games will be explored\".\n\nQ3. Did this book ever appear? What other work has been done in this \n    area in the last 15 years?\n\nWith thanks in advance for any information on this subject.\n\nChris Thompson\nEmail: <A HREF=\"mailto:cet1@cam.ac.uk\">cet1@cam.ac.uk</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
