But we can do much better\nthan that with kinematic GPS.\n<p><b>Carl Ellison:</b> Does that require line of sight [to differential\nstation]?\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> No, not to the differential station. Only to\nthe satellite.\n<p><b>Slide: \"Global Position System (2)\"</b>\n<p><b>Q:</b> The receivers are small but not the whole unit, am I right?\n<br><b>A:</b> No, the whole unit.\n<p><b>Slide: \"Geospatial Addressing (2)\"</b>\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> The address resolution is not high enough today.\n<p><b>Slide: \"Geospatial domain names\"</b>\n<p><b>Scott Michel:</b> \"uci.irvine.orangecounty.ca.us.geo\" could simply\nbe an absolute address, but you need an absolute reference.\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> One man's relative is another man's absolute.\n<p><i>Post-presentation questions and answers:</i>\n<p><b>Esther Dyson:</b> Really neat. But why use the domain name system\nat all?\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> I agree. Feel free to go ahead and fix that\nproblem.\n<br><b>Esther Dyson: </b>Why reuse the DNS, and get tied into all the politics?\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> I used it for the same reason any implementor\ndoes -- because it's there\n<br><b>Esther Dyson:</b> My favorite applications are luggage finders,\nchild finders.&nbsp; Why not a larger space, more general namespace than\nDNS? Why not many&nbsp; kinds of executable resolution servers?\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> Well, once you have it all fixed... :-)\n<br><b>Esther Dyson:</b> With all due respect, route around the DNS\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> route around the damage?\n<br><b>Esther Dyson:</b> Route around this excellently working system :-)\n<p><b>Mark Day: </b>What are you going to return when you *resolve* these\nnames? a car ought to yield vectors rather than lat/long points.\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> I'm a middleware/infrastructure guy -- these\nare just basics to a much more intriguing technology on top.\n<p><b>William Kornfeld:</b> Looks suspicious. By calling it a domain server\nwe assume you have a place you can send a message to -- there's nothing\nlistening there.\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> Unfortunately there is not enough time to talk\nabout geospatial routing.\"\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b>&nbsp; I can see that \"names vs. address' is fuzzy,\nbut this is so much a locator that I'm uncomfortable. The mapping between\nthe name and the physical space is an interesting thing -- the city of\nIrvine, e. g. -- you've been real free about talking about both things\ninterchangeably. We want to map between names and locations and then route\nbetween them. The really serious problem is, where is the namespace of\nplaces? Dublin Core... a server could tell you where it's located, what\nit covers. We need to connect some kind of service in a name I designated\nto place names. Introducing time, 1) the span of a physical object -- car\nposition changes over time 2) names themselves migrate in what they designate\n-- what were the boundaries of Irvine in 1945? (Null!). The mapping changes\nover time, too... the timespace of the intended mapping is a critical input,\ntoo.\n<br><b>Michael Gorlick:</b> Yes, it is time dependent.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> remarks that he refuses to talk the blame anymore.\n{Ed: Michael Gorlick used Rohit a lot as an excuse to shorten his answers.}\n<br>&nbsp;\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
