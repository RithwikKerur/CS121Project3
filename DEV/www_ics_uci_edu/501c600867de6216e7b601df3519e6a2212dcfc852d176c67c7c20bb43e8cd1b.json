Homework</B></FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Get your work checked and signed off by a classmate, then show it to your TA in lab by Monday, March 12.   This\nassignment is short; use the remaining time to complete the lab assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(a) </B></FONT>Suppose you have an electronic cookbook that contains a list of\nrecipes defined as follows:</P>\n<pre><code>     Recipe = namedtuple('Recipe', 'title ingredients steps')</code></pre>\nThe title is a string, ingredients is a list of strings, and steps is\na list of strings.  For example:\n<pre><code>     r = Recipe('Thai Iced Coffee', ['coffee', 'sugar', 'condensed milk', 'ice'],\n                ['brew coffee', 'mix with sugar and condensed-milk',\n                 'pour coffee mixture over ice'])</code></pre>\n<p>\n<strong>(a.1)</strong>\nDefine the function <code>is_ingredient_in_recipe</code>\nas described below.\n<pre><code>def is_ingredient_in_recipe(r: Recipe, ing: str) -> bool:\n   \"\"\" Return true if the string occurs in the recipe's ingredients list \"\"\"</code></pre>\n</p>\n<p><strong>(a.2)</strong>\n  Define the function <code>are_all_steps_short</code>\n  as described below.\n<pre><code>def are_all_steps_short(r: Recipe, limit: int) -> bool:\n   \"\"\" Return true if every step in the recipe is no longer than the limit \"\"\"</code>\n</pre>\n<p>Try to do this using list comprehensions or map/filter/reduce (and\n  remember that reduce has to be imported from the\n  <code>functools</code> library). [Hint:  First, try defining <code>count_words</code> and\n<code>is_step_short</code>, each of which can be done in one line.]</p>\n<!-- -->\n<p><strong>(a.3)</strong>\nDefine the function <code>is_recipe_simple</code>\nas described below.\n<pre><code>def is_recipe_simple(r: Recipe) -> bool:\n   \"\"\" Return true if recipe has 10 or fewer steps and each step is\n       no longer than 6 words. \"\"\"</code></pre></p>\n<!-- -->\n<p><strong>(a.4)</strong>\nThe first word of each step is a verb (e.g., bake, mix, grill); we can\ncall that the technique involved in that step. Define the function\n<code>does_recipe_use_technique</code> as described below.\n<pre><code>def does_recipe_use_technique(r: Recipe, technique: str) -> bool:\n   \"\"\" Return true if at least one step has the specified technique \"\"\"</code></pre>\n</p>\n<p>\n  <strong>(a.5)</strong>\n  Now, suppose you want to select recipes that will help you practice a\n  particular technique. Define the function\n  <code>simple_practice_recipes</code> as described below, using\n  previously defined functions where appropriate.  Try to use list\n  comprehensions and/or map/filter/reduce.\n<pre><code>def simple_practice_recipes(rList: 'list of Recipe', technique: str) -> 'list of Recipe':\n   \"\"\" Return a list of the recipes from the input that are simple\n       and that use the specified technique\"\"\"</code></pre>\n</p>\n<p><strong>(a.6)</strong>\n  Most of you probably recognize this problem from a quiz last quarter.\n  Now that you've had some experience in two programming languages,\n  what do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of programming\n  in each?  (You don't have to write anything formal for this; just\n  spend a little time reflecting on the issues.)\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(b)</B> Be able to give answers to questions\n  like these about the theme park simulator.  Feel free to talk with your classmates about them, but realize\n  that the point isn&#39;t to <I>have</I> the answer but to know <I>how to\n    get</I> the answer, especially if similar questions should show up on exams.</FONT></P>\n<UL><LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">The function <code>parseAttractionFile</code> reads attractions into a dictionary, then converts the dictionary into a list and passes the list to the AmusementPark.

Overall, customers are stored in an unordered list as customers in the park, and they go into and out of queues for rides (inqueued into ride lines, dequeued into ride cars where they're stored as a list, dequeued back into the park's list of customers).
