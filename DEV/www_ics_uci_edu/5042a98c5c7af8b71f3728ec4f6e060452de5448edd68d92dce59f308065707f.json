The Clipper chip \nis an algorithm for encrypting data that the government wants all user of \nthe internet to utilize.  What is data encryption?  Well, that's a \ngood place to start.\n<P>\n\t<A\nHREF=\"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/cryptography-faq/part03/faq.html\"\n>Data encryption</A> is any means by which someone disguises or otherwise\nmakes unreadable any piece of data.  The various ways of encrypting data\nare referred to as algorithms.  For instance, one alogrithm for encrypting\na message would be to shift the letters of the message by a certain\nnumber, say three.  Hence the word \"encode\" would be represented by\n\"hqfrgh.\"  'H' represents 'e', 'q' represents 'n', 'f' represents 'c', and\nso on--each letter shifted three forward letters.  The algorithm would\nthen be said to be shifting by n letters, and in this case, n is 3.  The\nnext question is how the receiver of the message unencrypt it.  That\nperson is given what is referred to as the \"key.\"  In this case the key\nwould be said to be 3.  Who should have access to the key?  That is major\nsource of controversy surrounding the Clipper chip. <P>\n\tThe <A\nHREF=\"http://cpsr.org/cpsr/privacy/crypto/clipper/clipper_faq.txt\">Clipper\nchip</A> is the algorithm developed by the government to encrypt voice\ntransmissions.  Its counterpart in data encryption is Capstone, the device\nthat influence much of the internet.  Though people usually refer to both\nof them as the Clipper chip.\n\tThe <A\nHREF=\"ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto/Clipper/brooks_nsa_clip-dt.testimony\"\n>National Security Agency</A> supports the Clipper chip quite simply so\nthe government will have access to it.  If everyone uses different data\nencryption algorithms, the government will not be able to regulate the\ninternet as much as it would like to.  For instance, if a criminal is\nsending information over the internet, the goverment will not be able\nunderstand what he sending.  However with the Clipper chip, the government\nwould have access to encrypted files.  Without it they may still use\nwiretaps, but it won't do them any good, because the data is encrypted. \nHow would the government be able to read the files without allowing anyone\nto do the same?  It works kind of like those locks used in schools.  Each\nstudent knows the combination to only his lock, but the teacher has a\nmaster key that allows access to all of the locks.  So each person using\nthe Clipper chip will be able to unencrypt only his own messages, while\nthe government will have a \"master code\" that will unencrypt any\ntransmission encrypted with the Clipper chip. <p> Most users of data\nencryption are entirely opposed to the thought of the government having a\nmeans to read <i>any</i> file they choose.  This <A\nHREF=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr25/jbde/www/matrix/clipper/clipper.time.html\">opposition</A>\ncomes from many sources--from average people to prestigious companies:\n<ul> <li>The U.S. Association for Computing Machinery's <A HREF\n=\"ftp://furmint.nectar.cs.cmu.edu/security/usacm-clipper\" >opposition to\nthe Clipper chip</A> is twofold:\n\t<ol> \n<li>As an encryption device it will hinder technological\ndevelopment and place U.S. companies behind foreign companies that will\nlikely not have to adhere to national standards. \n<li>Communications\nsecurity is too important to be left to secret processes and classified\nalgorithms.  They must be developed openly and with full public\nparticipation.\n\t</ol>\n<li>The <A HREF=\"ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/EFF/Policy/Crypto/Clipper/experts_v_clipper.letter\"\n>Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility</A> oppose the Clipper chip \non the grounds that:\n\t<ol>\n<li>The government will create extensive obstacles for companies with \nintentions to incresase technology in the area of data encryption.\n<li>In a formal request for comments from the Department of Commerce, very few \nreplied in favor of it.  Several hundred opposed it.\n\t</ol>\n<li>On the whole, most people oppose on the following grounds:\n\t<ol>\n<li>It is an infringement on personal freedom to be required to use any given \nencryption method.  A person may feel he has an algorithm that is more \neffective.  If the Clipper chip becomes mandatory, he will be denied this right.\n<li>It may not be a good enough algorithm.  If someone cracked it or otherwise \ngot their hands on the key, they would be able to read any file encrypted with \nthe Clipper chip, which would be <i>all</i> files.  That is <strong>tremendous\n</strong> power.\n<li>People quite simply don't want the government to have the capability to \nread <i>any</i> file any American sends.  It's a simple matter of privacy.\n\t</ol>  \n</ol>\n\n<h3>A few extra good resources</h3>\n<P>\n\tThe <A HREF=\"http://info.acm.org\">ACM</A> has composed an <A HREF=\"\nhttp://info.acm.org/REPORTS/ACM_CRYPTO_STUDY/_WEB/contents.html\">extensive \nreport</A> concerning the history of encryption, the government's right/need \nto have access to electronic inform\nation, and opposing arguments.  It's definitely worth checking out.\n<p>\n\tThe <A HREF=\"http://cpsr.org/dox/home.html\">CPSR</A> has available a \n<A HREF=\"http://cpsr.org/docs/clipper.fact.sheet.html\">fact sheet</A> that \ncontains many issues such as flaws with the Clipper chip, why people oppose it\n, and alternatives to it.\n\n<h3>Free Speech and Censorship: Whither goeth the Internet?</h3>\n\n<P>\n\tThe United States has long struggled with the controversy engendered by \nits much beloved and equally maligned <A \nHREF=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html# amendmenti>First Amendement.</a>  \nAmericans often embrace the f\nree speech that happens to agree with their personal inclinations, then \nangrily argue to suppress that which they don't like; this debate over \npermissable censorship has traditionally been waged in the arenas of spoken \nand printed expression.  Groups like\n the American Civil Liberties Union have long fought to safeguard our freedom \nof speech and expression, often entering the difficult realms of sexism, \nracism, agism, pornography, (to name a few); with the advent of local and \ninternational communication over the Internet, yet more complex problems arise.\n<p>\n\tRecent legislation has been proposed, and some passed, to curb \npotential criminal abuse of the Internet; people fear that unlawful activity \ncould easily be masked without government intervention in the form of an \nencryption device to which the government\n alone holds the key (i.e., the Clipper Chip, as described above).  Another \nmajor fear is that, unlike television, which can limit raunchy programming to \nlate-night time slots, and pornographic video and printed materials which \nrequire proof of age identi\nfication, the Internet is an open forum which could allow minors access to \nmaterial  currently deemed unacceptable and less accessible.  There is also \nconsiderable concern that child pornography and other material deemed \n\"obscene\" may be passed on through\n hard-to-trace computer channels; to combat this problem, legislation has \nbeen introduced which would enable prosecution of any person with any contact \nwhatsoever with the illegal material, even if that contact were limited to \nthe material having simply passed through an individual computer.  \n<p>\n\tWhile it may be initially appealing to agressively prosecute those who \ntransgress our social taboos, the vast, ambiguous spectrum of \"crime\" is \nsubject to an equally vast spectrum of interpretation.  \"Obscenity\" is defined \nas something that offends \"community standards;\" those standards change from \ncommunity to community.   We cannot reasonably start holding people \nresponsible for offending standards outside their community, i.e., \narresting someone in Santa Fey for violating a Boise ordinance.  \n<p>\n\tThe trouble with censorship is that a little tends to go a long way: \nthe same is true of surveillance. \nCensorship involves limiting or eliminating access to the object in \nquestion; surveillance is used to\n monitor peoples' lawful and unlawful activities (for instance, watering\none's plants or interacting with censored materials).  The legislation\ncurrently under consideration would make anyone in <A\nHREF=\"http://www.eff.org/pub/EFF/Legal/obscenity_online.article>possession</a>\nof obscene material susceptible to prosecution, whether or not the person\nis aware that they possess the material.  While it is clearly very\nimportant to protect children, we must be careful not to lose sight of the\nwhole picture; protection does not necessarily have to mean forfeiture of\nall liberties.  Senator Exon, (D-Nebraska) has come up with a bill\nentitled the <A HREF=\"http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-bill.html>\n\"Communications Decency Act of 1995\" </a> that will have \"very serious\nnegative ramifications for freedom of expression on Usenet, the Internet,\nand all electronic networks... and would remove guarantees of privacy and\nfree speech on [those] networks, and may even effectively close them down\nas a medium to exchange ideas and information,\" according to <A\nHREF=\"http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-credits.html> slowdog and\nfriends</a>.  The proposed <A\nHREF=\"http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-appendix.html>legislation</a>\nwould expand current FCC regulations on indecent and obscene audiotext to\ncover <i>all</i> content carried over all forms of electronic\ncommunications networks, and any network used in the transmission of\nthreatening, lewd, indecent, or harrassing messages would be subject to\nsubstantial criminal liability.  The result of such severe restrictions\nwould force service providers into a very difficult position: fearful of\ncriminal prosecution, they would be compelled to either severely restrict\ntheir subscribers' Internet activity, or worse, to shut down their\nInternet access entirely.  \n<p>\n\tThis brings us to the question of surveillance, since service\nproviders, in order to protect themselves, would be expected to monitor\nthe private communication between its clients.  The threat of such\nsurveillance is in direct opposition to our cherished, constitutional\nrights to free speech and privacy.  In response, a <A\nHREF=\"http://www.phantom.com/~slowdog/petition-statement.html>petition</a>\nis circulating against the passage of the bill, citing its constitutional\nrepercussions, the impracticality of the monitoring requirements, and the\neconomic downslide that would result from a loss of consumer confidence in\nthe Internet's commercial appeal.  Current law permits surveillance when\nthere is reasonable cause to suspect wrongdoing; why should we now unleash\nBig Brother on our private, as well as public communication?\n<P>\n\tThe government's proposed Clipper Chip proposal, in addition to\nCongress' attempts at anti-privacy legislation, present a dark side to the\never-growing Internet; we must carefully weigh the issues at stake before\nacting to abort the individual freedom that we so pride ourselves on. \n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
