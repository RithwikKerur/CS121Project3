Here relation\nbetween elements are determined by \u2018equality\u2019 comparisons whose outcome is =\nwhen the two elements being compared are equal and = otherwise. We determine\nthe complexity of sorting (finding the frequency of every element), finding\nmode and other frequently occurring elements using only =,= comparisons. We\nshow that \u03a9(n<sup>2</sup>/m) comparisons are necessary and this many comparisons are\nsufficient to find an element that appears at least m times. This is in sharp\ncontrast to the bound of \u0398(n log(n/m)) bound in the model where comparisons\nare <, =, > or \u2264, >.\n<p>\nPaper by Varunkumar Jayapul, J.
