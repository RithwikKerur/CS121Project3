Although not all of the sites work and the site does \ndepend on visitors leaving interesting sites. This leaves some of the sites\nas opportunistic advertising rather than as a &quot;fun&quot; site.\n<li><A HREF=\"http://www.galcit.caltech.edu/~ta/lb/lb.html\">Lite Brite</a>: A\nsite for you to use to relieve the tensions of the day. You get to make the\nphotons that come off the screen work for you rather than have them fatigue\nyour eyes.\n<li><A HREF=\"http://clunix.cl.msu.edu/weather/\">Current Weather Maps and Movies\n</a>:Whether you want to fly around the world or walk out of the Office of\nAcademic Computing labs and stay dry, this is &quot;Weather Central&quot;!!!\nBeware though that the pictures are nice, but the large weather maps take a\nlong, long, long time to get back to you.\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<A NAME=\"Questions\"><H2>The Formerly Unanswerable, Answered!!!</H2></a>\n<ol>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ1\">Do You Have A Voice on The Web?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ2\">What is a Transparent GIF???</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ3\">How Much Computing Power Does it Take to Analyze a Protein?\n</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ4\">Where can you get an Appendectomy on The Web?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ5\">Where can one get good Irish Coffee, and Islamic Doughnuts?</A>\n</ol>\n<p><HR>\n<OL>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ1\"><H2>Do You Have A Voice on The Web?</H2></A>\nThe simple answer is, <em>yes</em>!!! I decided to check the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/MetaIndex.html\">\ninternet resources meta-index</a>\nunder the &quot;Navigate&quot; menu of Mosaic. The\nMeta-Index is a collection of Web resource directories and other indices.\n&quot;Meta, &quot; based on the Webster Dictionary (on ea, not the Web\ninterface, which provided no answer), means\n&quot;more comprehensive, transcending,&quot; and this index lives up to\nthis definition.\nAt the index, which I opened by accident, I went to the\n<A HREF=\"http://cybersight.com/cgi-bin/cs/s?main.gmm\">Cybersight</a>, where you\narrive into a world of optical illusions, and some sites to jump to. This is\nwhen I chose the option for\n<A HREF=\"http://cybersight.com/cgi-bin/cs/s?poll.gmml\">polls</a>. You find that\nyou not only have a voice, but you arrive where you can voice an opinion on \nwhich voice you like the best. People can see what current feelings are on\nissues such as the\n<A HREF=\"http://cybersight.com/cgi-bin/cs/ballot/oj?1\">O.J. Simpson trial.</a>\nThese polls allow one to give an opinion and see total results\n<i>immediately.</i> I thought, based on television and newspaper\n&quot;polls&quot;, that many people\nthink O.J. is innocent and that they feel that his status as a national\n&quot;hero&quot; would not earn him the death penalty. After responding to the\npoll, I found 54% of respondents believe that the death penalty <i>is</i>\nwarranted, with 31% objecting not because of O.J., but because they are against\ncapital punishment.\nThe media may affect people's impressions, but the immediate feedback of the\npoll on the Web is much more convincing. One aspect to take into account though\nis the diversity, or lack thereof, of people responding to the poll. As yet,\nthe Web is still a mystery to many people.\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What is a Transparent GIF???</H2></A>\nWhen I decided to put the above Anteater in this document, I opened an\nunexpected can of worms. Steve Franklin, instructor of the ICS\n1C course, wrote back to my query of how I could get the image to my home\ndirectories, and I realized that I had forgotten some fundamentals. Steve\nreminded me that I could use the URL (that I had discovered) to open the\nimage with mosaic, which would open the &quot;add on&quot; viewer xv to view \nthe image. But I saved the image to my home directories using xv, which made \nthe image retain its <A HREF=\"anteater.gif\">white background</a>.\nThis means the image is <em>not</em> transparent. A\n<A HREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/faq/www_faq.html#transparent\">\ntransparent GIF</a> is one where the background of the image blends with the\nbackground the browser has decided to use. The <A HREF=\"#Anteater\">above\nphoto of Sepi K.</a> is an example of a transparent GIF.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>How Much Computing Power Does it Take to Analyze a \nProtein?</H2></A>\nThis was something I totally stumbled upon in a team quest to find a California\nhome page. After seeing that South Dakota had a Web home page, we figured that\nCalifornia <em>must</em> have a home page. On my hotlist is a page of \n<A HREF=\"http://cuiwww.unige.ch/meta-index.html\"> WWW Search Engines.</a> We\nlooked up California at the documentation level of this page, using the NCSA\nDocfinder slot, and instead of getting pages about California,\n<A HREF=\"http://docfinder.ncsa.uiuc.edu:7999/bin/finder?California\">\nwe found 78 records</a> associated with California. Based solely on the titles\nof the search results, I chose to look at a page named\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Pubs/MetaCenter/SciHi93/1a.Highlights-BiologyA.html\">1a.Highlights-BiologyA.html</a>. At the bottom, a\n&quot;button&quot; pointed to the right, and I followed it to\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Pubs/MetaCenter/SciHi93/1b.Highlights-BiologyB.html\">Distributing Molecular Dynamics Calculations</a>. This page takes a\nlook at using parallel linked supercomputers to compute the folding\npatterns of proteins. The limiting factors on computing, up to this point, have\nbeen modeling the effects of water molecules on protein folding. It is\nnecessary to account for at least 5000 water molecules when considering these\ninteractions, and this requires massive computing power. It seems that\ndistributed computing allows different computers to work together by giving\neach computer the task best suited for it.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n<p><LI><H2>\n<A NAME=\"QQ4\">Where can you get an Appendectomy on The Web?</A>\n<A HREF=\"http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/VirtualHospital.html\">\n<IMG SRC=\"http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/VHLogoSmall.gif\" ALT=[Hospital]>\n</a></H2>\nWell, you may not want to do an appendectomy after reading this page (unless\nyou have a strange inkling to use your &quot;sterile&quot; Swiss Army knife)\nbut you can certainly learn how to conduct one in a sterile operating theatre\nby learning how to become a health professional.\n<A HREF=\"http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/VirtualHospital.html\">The Virtual\nHospital</a> of the University of Iowa maintains a page on the medical\nprofession, and an extensive collection of medical journals about radiology,\nas it is the radiology department at the U of Iowa that maintains these web\npages.\nSomething I found of great interest, especially as a pre-med bio-major, is the\ninformation about the <A HREF=\"http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/ICM/ICM2.html\">\nmedical student curriculum.</a> There was also an intersting page as an\n<A HREF=\"http://indy.radiology.uiowa.edu/ICM/IntroFiles.html\">introduction to\nclinical medicine.</a> It contained the transcribed notes of a medical student\nduring the spring semester of 1992, and certainly taught me a little about\nthe paranasal sinus disorder (sinus infection) that I had earlier this quarter.\nI found this site through the\n<A HREF=\"http://info.er.usgs.gov/network/science/biology/index.html\">\nUSGS biology server reference page</a> which was a part of the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/MetaIndex.html\">\ninternet resources meta-index</a>\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>Where can one get good Irish Coffee and Islamic\nDoughnuts?</H2></A>\nThe man to ask is named\n<A HREF=\"http://www.gdol.com/~david/index.html\">David (david@gdol.com)</a>,\nand his home page is amazing!!! He is\n<b>LINKED!!!</b> If you enjoy fine foods and lots of culture, you have\nfound the man, and the web site to check out. This site caught my eye because\nit has \n<b>FREE</b>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.gdol.com/~david/food/coffee.gif\">coffee</a> and\n<A HREF=\"http://www.gdol.com/~david/food/donuts.gif\">donuts</a>!!!\nCoffee and Donuts, juxtaposed by a man that loves all things \n<A HREF=\"http://www.gdol.com/kearns-l/irish.cgi\">Irish</a>\nand also has an interest in\n<A HREF=\"http://www.gdol.com/~david/islam.html\">Islam</a> and\n<A HREF=\"http://www.gdol.com/~david/islam.html\">Morocco</a>,\nwhere is wife is from. He keeps a neat, tidy, and updated web page, and\nhe even has a region of the page which recognizes the client computer\nrunning your browser, and gives you, as a user,\n<em>(user@rigel.oac.uci.edu)</em> things you\nmight be interested in. He doesn't get your login, but at least gets where you\nare visiting from. If David's coffee is not the roast that you are looking for\nyou can always stop by the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/coffee.html\">\nTrojan Room Coffee Machine</a>.
