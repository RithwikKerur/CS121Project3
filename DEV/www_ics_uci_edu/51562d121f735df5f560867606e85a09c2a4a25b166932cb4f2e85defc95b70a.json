A friend had a book about Jews in a small\r\nportion of upstate NY in connection with her own family history.  She knew of\r\nmy interest in Langsams and pointed out the section.  I created a mini family\r\ntree from the book's description.  Years later, in 1997, actually, I had a\r\nletter from Martin Langsam, 6400 Mill Pointe Circle, Delray Beach, FL 33484 and\r\nwe carried on a minor correspondence.  He said he was the son of Jack and\r\nTessie Langsam from H20.  He was also related on his mother's side to H63 but I\r\ncould never get him to tell him how that relationship worked. I called him and\r\ngot very little from him.  He said that his father, Jack, was born in 1892 in\r\nAustria.  His grandfather was Aaron or Aron.  Rose Kopita was his great aunt,\r\nhis grandfather's sister.  Aron's gravestone says that her father was Zvi\r\nElimelech.  Aron's wife was Etta Stecker. It was Etta who was somehow related\r\nto H63.\r\n\r\n\r\nRose and Abe Kopita had a son Frank who lived in California in 1997.  He had 3\r\nsons, but Martin didn't know their whereabouts.  Rose and Abe were married in\r\nNYC before moving to Tupper Lake.  I never tried to find their marriage record.\r\n\r\n\r\nRose is probably buried in Ogdensburg.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will make you a copy of Martin's longest letter which may help a bit more.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuzan\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: XRA3600@aol.com \r\nDate: Wed, 4 Jul 2001 20:55:27 EDT \r\nSubject: genealogy \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\niam trying to locate where my relatives were born in europe.if you have any \r\ninformation that could be of help i would appreciate an e-mail back. \r\n do you have any affiliation with the following people \r\n            susan wynne \r\n             yedidyah langsam \r\n              estelle guzik \r\n   i am a resident of florida.i was born & raised in brooklyn n.y. \r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Wed, 04 Jul 2001 22:16:51 -0400\r\nTo: XRA3600@aol.com\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: genealogy\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your inquiry.

Have you obtained Aaron's death \r\ncertificate? Naturalization Record? Ship Record? How old was Aaron? I am \r\nguessing that the TWO attached ship records are your family. If so, we \r\nalready know a lot, like they came from Lancut, Galicia. Aaron came to his \r\nuncle. He was born 1867. There is a naturalization record listed by his \r\nchildren, so we should try to locate it. Have you looked for Aaron in the \r\n1900 census in NY? Maybe it lists him with this uncle (he came in 1899).\r\n\r\nAny other Langsam's buried near Aaron? There are quite a few Langsam's at Mt. \r\nHebron. \r\n\r\nWith that said, the basic approach is to go up another branch when you hit a \r\ndeadend.So, did your grandfather have any known siblings? Did you father ever \r\nspeak of aunts, uncles, or cousins? From your father's other siblings, were \r\nthere any children? If so, have you contacted all of them? I can be of assistance \r\nin that area if you prefer.\r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: XRA3600@aol.com \r\nDate: Thu, 5 Jul 2001 00:11:55 EDT \r\nSubject: Re: genealogy \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\nX-Mailer: AOL 6.0 for Windows US sub 10513 \r\n\r\ni am not in all the time .give me a time & i will be here. \r\ni wantto add a bit of info,ihave asister ethel & acousin  belonging to rose \r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: XRA3600@aol.com \r\nDate: Sun, 8 Jul 2001 22:53:14 EDT \r\nSubject: Re: Can you supply me with the correct email address for the Bronx Langsam's? \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\nX-Mailer: AOL 6.0 for Windows US sub 10513 \r\n\r\ni haven't any address for harry&sue langsam. there name came to me from a \r\njanite@aol.com  who contacted me on line &she wanted to know if i was related \r\nto them \r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Sun, 08 Jul 2001 23:01:26 -0400\r\nTo: XRA3600@aol.com\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Can you supply me with the correct email address for the Bronx Langsam's?\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThat is the address that I refer to.

Based on our conversation \r\nI checked the EIDB. He also mailed me a tombstone picture of Aaron's (in Hebrew). \r\nWith that I went to NY Vital Records (Chambers St). Based on the tombstone and death \r\nrecord, his Aaron is the same Aaron listed in L5.0.2\r\n\r\nPoints: Aaron was from Lancut, as per EIDB (see attachment),\r\nThe tombstone says his father was Hersh Mylech\r\nHe was 71 in 1937, the age fits the other children\r\nL5.0.2 says that Aaron came to the USA\r\nHis death record says Aaron's mother was Beila.\r\n\r\n-Moishe\r\n\r\nPS: I have downloaded ALL the Langsam references in the EIDB that I could find. For \r\nthose interested, I have a spreadsheet and the corresponding .gif files (total 21 mb). \r\n_________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 7/16/01</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
