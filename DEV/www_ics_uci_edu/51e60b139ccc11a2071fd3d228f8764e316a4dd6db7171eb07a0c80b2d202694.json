The standard Robertson-Webb model\nallows the protocol to make two types of queries, Evaluation and Cut, to\nthe players.  A deterministic divide-and-conquer protocol with complexity\n<I>O</I>(<I>n</I> log <I>n</I>) is known.  We provide the first &Omega;(<I>n</I> log <I>n</I>) lower bound on\nthe complexity of any deterministic protocol in the standard model.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
