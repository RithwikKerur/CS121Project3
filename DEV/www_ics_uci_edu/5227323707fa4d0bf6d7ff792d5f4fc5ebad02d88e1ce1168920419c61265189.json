You may be less familiar with what we expect when you prepare\nand submit writing assignments.  Please read this sheet carefully, and read\nit over again each time you start a new assignment.  Your grade will suffer\nif you don&#39;t follow these instructions.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Most of this document applies to Informatics 161 and\nto ICS 139W; both classes involve significant writing assignments.  We point\nout portions that apply just to one class.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Submission mechanics:</B>  Unless we say\notherwise, you will submit each assignment in two ways:  on paper at the\nbeginning of class on the due date and electronically, using the web-based\nsubmission system at </FONT><code>checkmate.ics.uci.edu</code><FONT  SIZE=4>.\n We may use either or both versions for grading, so it&#39;s important that\nyou submit each assignment both ways and that your paper and electronic\nversions are the same.  We don&#39;t expect technical difficulties with\nCheckmate, but if you have any, let us know by Email right away; don't just assume that your paper submission is sufficient.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Intermediate versions:</B>  Writing is\nan iterative process.  The first words you put on paper won&#39;t be perfect,\nany more than the first code you type when you start writing a program.\n Revision&mdash;debugging&mdash;is the norm. </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>For most assignments, you will turn in more\nthan one version.  We may refer to these intermediate versions as drafts,\nbut don&#39;t think of them as incomplete, haphazard &quot;rough drafts&quot;\nor first attempts.  Every one of your drafts should be as good as you can\nmake it&mdash;thoughtful, polished work with no spelling or sentence-level errors.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>In 139W, we typically edit one draft in class.\n Don&#39;t waste your group editing time on proofreading; it&#39;s your\njob to do that in advance so your editor can address the content.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>For longer assignments, you will turn in a\nrevised draft (based on the in-class editing in 139W or based on your TA&#39;s\nreview of your outline in 161); we will grade this draft and return it to\nyou with comments so you can revise it before you turn in your final version.\n Doing a good job on intermediate versions will help your grade; on the\nassignments where we grade more than one version, your score on the intermediate\nversion counts for about one-third of the assignment&#39;s grade (the other\ntwo-thirds being the final version, of course).  For each later version\nof an assignment that you turn in, you must turn in the marked copies of\nall the earlier versions, including (for 139W) the written results of your\nin-class editing session.  This applies to your paper submissions; your\nelectronic submissions should include only the current version.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Plagiarism&mdash;don&#39;t do it:</B>  Plagiarism\nmeans presenting somebody else&#39;s work as if it&#39;s your own.  You\nmay use whatever outside sources (books, friends, interviews, periodicals)\nare appropriate for an assignment, so long as you cite them:  <em>Any time you\nuse two or more words in a row that you didn&#39;t think up and write yourself,\nyou must put the words in quotation marks and indicate where they came from.</em> (There could be situations where this two-word rule isn&#39;t appropriate.\n If you think you have one, check with us.)  Even if you paraphrase (state\nin your own words) someone else&#39;s work or ideas, you should cite the\nsource (e.g., &quot;Dijkstra says that unrestricted branching is dangerous.&quot;).\n Plagiarism is academically dishonest, and we expect that nobody in the\nclass will engage in it.  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>That should be enough said, but unfortunately\nthere have been instances of plagiarism in these courses in the past.  We\nwill check for it both manually and by using software that compares students&#39;\nwork with work from other sources, including the Internet and work submitted\nin previous quarters.  ICS school policy is that plagiarists fail the course\nand have their offense recorded in the Student Affairs Office.  Academic honesty\nviolations can affect a student&#39;s graduation, financial aid, and eligibility\nfor honors.  The school deals with plagiarism cases every quarter, even\nthough most people don&#39;t hear about them.  No matter how pressured you\nfeel, don&#39;t plagiarize; it&#39;s not worth it.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Grammatical mechanics:</B>  We expect you,\nas upper-division students who have satisfied the lower-division writing\nrequirement, to have a good command of the mechanical principles of English\nsyntax, spelling, and punctuation.  These courses focus on content, organization,\naudience, and style.  We expect that you will take the time to make your\nassignments nearly flawless from a mechanical standpoint.  We will not mark\nevery mechanical error on your papers, but they will lower your grade, and\nwe will ask you to resubmit assignments with significant mechanical problems.\n Use a writing reference on these issues; the <a href=\"http://www.writing.uci.edu/resources.html\">UCI Writing Center</a> lists many on-line resources.  Students\nwho wish to hone these mechanical skills further should also contact the <a href=\"http://www.writingcenter.uci.edu\">Writing Center</a>, which provides a variety of workshops and services.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Any upper division computer science student\nshould be aware that software-based grammar checkers are horribly inaccurate\nand entirely untrustworthy.  Problems may still exist in a document that\nthe grammar checker doesn&#39;t complain about, and often grammar checkers\ncomplain about passages that are perfectly fine.  It is particularly dangerous\nto use a grammar checker the way a first-year programming student uses an\nIDE, just tweaking the prose until all the green squiggles go away.  Grammar\ncheckers are no substitute for knowing what you&#39;re doing; if it were\npossible to describe natural language completely and accurately in software,\nwe&#39;d all be able to converse with our computers just as they do in the\nmovies.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Spelling and spelling checkers:  </B>Never\nrely solely on an automatic spelling checker; they help, but they do not\nsubstitute for human intelligence in proofreading.  Spelling checkers locate\nsome typographical errors, but they cannot identify such commonly occurring\nerrors as incorrectly used words (&quot;of&quot; for &quot;or,&quot; &quot;it&#39;s&quot;\nfor &quot;its,&quot; &quot;there&quot; for &quot;their&quot; or &quot;they&#39;re&quot;)\nor inadvertent substitution of one valid word for another (such as &quot;consistency&quot;\nfor &quot;consistently&quot;).  Also be careful of auto-correct software; the computer is not always right about what it thinks you meant. Always leave yourself the time for a calm,\nundistracted review of your document for these mechanical errors, independent\nof your revisions for content and style.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4><B>Counting words and pages:</B> So that we can speak consistently of the\n  length of assignments, &quot;one page&quot; will refer to one standard,\n  double-spaced typewritten page.  At roughly 30 lines of text per page and\n  roughly 10 words per line, one page by this measure contains roughly 300\n  words.  Typeset material from books and magazines is typically denser. \n  You should use this as a general guideline, and not waste time counting\n  individual words by hand.  Most word processors have automatic word counters,\n  however, which you may use if you wish.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Typography and layout:</B>  Your papers must be typewritten\nor word-processed, of course.  Everything you turn in should be double-spaced except for the final versions of your Influencing Policy letter and your change proposal.  [Double-spacing makes it easier for an editor\u2014a classmate or instructor\u2014to make comments on particular passages. Final versions, on the other hand, should look like polished documents</FONT>. When we give page counts, we're counting double-spaced pages, so of course your single-spaced final version will be half that length.]</P>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4>Be sure to read</FONT><code>\n  <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/typography.pdf\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/typography.pdf</A></code><FONT  SIZE=4>\n  and apply the typographic principles described there to your papers.  If\n  you use a very old printer, please make sure the print quality is still\n  clean and legible.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Binding:</B>  Do not use any kind of report\ncover.  A simple staple in the upper left-hand corner is perfectly fine.</FONT> For later submissions on paper, which must include previous drafts (as described above), you can group the different components with a big paper clip or &quot;purse clip&quot;; make sure your name is somewhere on each piece, though.</P>\n<BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
