Suppose that we are computing shortest paths in a graph G that has t^2 vertices and t^3 edges, for some integer parameter t.\n\n(a) What would be the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm on G, using a priority queue that stores all its items in an unordered list and searches the whole list each time the minimum-priority item is required? Your answer should be expressed in O-notation, as a function of t, in as simple terms as possible.\n\n(b) What would be the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm using a binary heap as a priority queue?\n\n(c) What would be the best choice of d to use, for Dijkstra's algorithm on this graph using a d-ary heap as a priority queue?\n\n(d) What would be the running time of Dijkstra's algorithm with a d-ary heap, using the value of d you gave in your answer to part (c)?\n\n\n2. In modern versions of Java, the dynamic array structure is called an ArrayList, but earlier versions of Java had a similar structure called a Vector. The difference between a Vector and an ArrayList is that when an ArrayList of n items runs out of room, it grows to 2n items, whereas when a Vector of n items runs out of room, it grows to n+K items, where K is a number that is chosen when the Vector is initialized.\n\nWhat is the amortized time per insertion operation of a Vector, with the growth rules described above? Express your answer in O-notation as a function of N, where N is the number of insertion operations performed. In order to simplify your answer, you should assume that K is a fixed constant.\n\n\n3. For a binary heap H, define a potential function Phi(H) to be n log n, where n is the number of items currently in the heap.\n\n(a) Show that with this definition, the insert operation in a binary\nheap still takes O(log n) amortized time.\n\n(b) Show that with this definition, finding and removing the minimum\nelement in a binary heap takes constant amortized time.\n\nFor both parts, the data structure should be unchanged; we are merely\nanalyzing it differently.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
