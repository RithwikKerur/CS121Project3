We propose a simple definition for points in the plane,\ncalled the <i>crust</i>. \n\n<p>We can prove that if a smooth curve is sampled densely enough,\nthen the crust of the samples approximates the curve, with no\nextraneous features. The minimum required sampling density varies\nalong the curve according to the <i>Local Feature Size</i> (which\nis also simply defined), so that areas of less detail can be\nsampled less densely.</p>\n\n<p>The crust is easy to compute using Voronoi diagrams in\nO(<i>n</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) time (even in practice). We will\ndemonstrate the computation of crusts on arbitrary point sets.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
