Basically, there \nare two main federations nowadays.  The biggest (and most profitable) \nis the WWF, or the World Wrestling Federation.  The WWF has a history \ndating back to the 1960's where it has crowned several World Champions! \nYou can even see a list of these \n<A HREF=\"http://www.luc.edu/~mlong/wwf.world.titles.html\">monsters of \nmayhem!</A> Interestingly enough, the WWF has what it calls an \n&quot;Intercontinental Title&quot; as well.  This holder of this title \nhas always served as the number one contender to the World Champ.  \nThere's also a comprehensive list of all the WWF's <A \nHREF=\"http://www.luc.edu/~mlong/wwf.interc.titles.html\">Intercontinental \nChamps.</A>  The second most-profitable wrestling organization is the \nWCW, or World Championship Wrestling.  This one is owned by the world's \n&quot;most stable&quot; billionaire extraordinaire, Ted Turner.  Like the \nWWF, the WCW has a wide variety of champions.  However, the WCW saw its \nbeginnings in the early part of the 20th Century.  You can see this long \nlist of <A HREF=\"http://www.luc.edu/~mlong/nwawcw.world.titles.html\">WCW \nWorld Champions.</a>  The list of <A \nHREF=\"http://www.luc.edu/~mlong/nwawcw.us.titles.html\">United States \nTitle Holders</a> (which is really the equivalent to the WWF \nIntercontinental Championship) can be found as well.\n <p>\n<A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>Who are on the legislative committees in the \nSouth Dakota state legislature?</H2></A> The answer to this question \ndepends on what branch of the legislature you mean.  In South Dakota (as \nin most states), the legislature is bicameral.  This means there are two \nseparate &quot;houses&quot;--the state senate and the state assembly.  Both \nhouses have a number of special committees, which help fulfill their \nultimate goal in getting legislation passed through the legislature. \nSuch committees deal with South Dakota \nissues on both the state and local levels.  You can see a listing of the \nmembers, the political parties they belong to, and the committee names of \neither the South Dakota <A \nHREF=\"http://www.state.sd.us/state/legis/lrc/hscmtes.htm\">House \nStanding Committees</A> or the South Dakota <A \nHREF=\"http://www.state.sd.us/state/legis/lrc/sscmtes.htm\">Senate Standing \nCommittees.</A>\n <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>What are the functions of the US State \nDepartment and Department of Health and Human Services?</H2></A> Let's start \nwith the \nState Department.  Basically, the State Department is the &quot;eyes and \nears&quot; of America's foreign policy.  Among other things, it sets out \nto establish relations with the rest of the world.  There are several \nareas which the State Department handles.  You can read more about these \n<A \nHREF=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Cabinet/html/Department_of_State.html\">State Department roles.</A>\nThe Department of Health and Human Services wants to keep all of America \nwell.  In a nutshell, this wing of the Executive Branch is responsible \nfor overseeing a wide variety of programs dealing with the health and \nwell-being of all segments of America.  You can find out more about the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.os.dhhs.gov/0/os_home/mission.html\">Department of \nHealth and Human Services.</A> \n <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to \nlist of questions.</it></a>\n\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>What is HTML, and how does it work?</H2></A>\nHTML stands for &quot;Hyper Text Markup Language.&quot;  Simply put, HTML \nis a language by which one can go about creating documents to be viewed \non a browser (such as Mosaic or Netscape). HTML helps make it possible \nfor plain text to be \"marked up\".  As John December and Neil Randall say \nin \"The World Wide Web Unleashed\", the current version of HTML is 2.0.  \nWhile this version allows more features (such as graphics), the two note \nthat it still has a ways to go.  For instance, they say, HTML 2.0 is not \nyet equipped to do some specific, useful functions (such as desktop \npublishing).  The two also note that HTML allows for &quot;links&quot; to \nother sites on the web.  Thus, instead of being limited to a single web \npage, one can click on a link (if there is one on that page) and receive \nmore information on the subject.  HTML, they say, has made this possible. \nThere is much more information available on <A \nHREF=\"http://melmac.harris-atd.com/about_html.html\">what HTML is.</a>  If \nyou were interested in finding out ways of <A \nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/strict-html.html\">programming in HTML</a>, you could do that as well. <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>What is new on Mosaic?</H2></A>\nIn order to tell you what's new on Mosaic, perhaps it's best to describe \nwhat Mosaic is.  Mosaic is a browser which allows a user to view a \ndocument/file in HTML format. Before Mosaic, information could only be \npresented in text form.  With Mosaic, however, someone can look at \naccompanying images.  Unfortunately, Mosaic is unable to display certain \ntypes of files currently (it needs the help of an add-on \nprogram) In addition, there are other limitations with Mosaic (one of \nwhich is its inability to incorporate other internet functions). Other \nthan these limitations, Mosaic has proven to be a beneficial way of \ndisplaying information. The program operates \non a few different terminal types.  For our purposes, we can see <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/XMosaic/d2-intro.html\">how \nMosaic operates on X terminals.</a>  Mosaic is also constantly updated.  \nYou can find out <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/whats-new.html\">what's new on Mosaic.</a> If you get stuck, you can always get help on <A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/XMosaic/d2-userguide\">how to use Mosaic.</a>   \n</OL>\n\n<hr><p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted January 30, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
