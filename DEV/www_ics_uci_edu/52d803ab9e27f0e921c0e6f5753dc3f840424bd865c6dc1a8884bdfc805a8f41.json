People learn best when they apply what they read as they go. \n There&#39;s always a big gap between thinking you understand something\nyou read and actually being able to apply it.  We expect these exercises to go\nquickly, but if you find yourself spending more than a couple of minutes\non an exercise without making any progress, you should ask us (or a classmate)\nabout it rather than continuing to spin your wheels unproductively.  Note that this also\nmeans you should get started early, so that you&#39;ll have the time to\nget any questions answered.  </FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>It's not a big deal if you come to lab on Monday without having been able to answer a couple of the homework exercises, but if that happens, we'll expect that you will already have asked a few classmates or sent us a question at <code>icsh21@uci.edu</code>.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>You should also expect to find, especially\n  after a week or two, that when you have the right answer you&#39;ll know\n  that it&#39;s right. (Of course, having a computer to check it will help,\n  but you will probably observe this even before you check it on the machine.\n  This makes a contrast from the usual experience with other popular programming languages,\n  where &quot;Click &#39;Run&#39; and cross your fingers&quot; is the way people often work.)</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(1)</B>  Do everything on the course syllabus\nunder the heading, &quot;What to do this week to get started in ICS H21.&quot;\n This includes registering yourself with Checkmate at </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><a href=\"http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu\"><code>http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu</code></a></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>,\nfilling out the questionnaire at <a href=\"http://eee.uci.edu/survey/h21.f09.q\"><code>http://eee.uci.edu/survey/h21.f09.q</code></a>, and turning in your photo.</FONT></P>\n<P><strong><font size=\"4\" face=\"Garamond\">(2)</font></strong><font size=\"4\" face=\"Garamond\"> Read through <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/lab0.html\">Lab Assignment 0</a> before you come to lab on Friday just so you get an idea of what you'll be doing with your partner. </font></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(3)</B>  We encourage you to talk\nwith each other and help each other understand how to do the assignments.\n There are some limits, though; in particular, remember that knowing <em>how</em> to do it (so you can do it on the midterm, for example) is much more important than just putting down the answer.

The on-line version is a bit newer than the printed version, though many people prefer to read longer documents on paper. As you read Chapter 2 of the HtDP\n  text, do exercises 2.2.2 and 2.3.2.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(6)</B>  Look at sections A, B, and C of the <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/scheme/finger.html\">Scheme Finger Exercises</a\n>.  You don't have to write the answers down or turn them in, but make absolutely sure that you know how to do them.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(7)</B> Read through <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/lab1.html\">Lab Assignment 1</a> before lab on Monday so you have an idea of what's coming.</FONT> <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4> You should take a minute to consult the DrScheme Help Desk from the Help\nmenu, find the list of teachpacks, and look at the documentation for image.ss.\n This lists all the functions that teachpack makes available for you.  We\nwon&#39;t be using all of them, but you should get an idea of what operations are\navailable.  This kind of documentation describes an <B>API</B>, an application\nprogramming interface (also called an SDK, for software development kit); it&#39;s a list of functions that someone has added,\na toolkit we can use for some task.</FONT></P>\n<P></P>\n<P><strong><font size=\"4\" face=\"Garamond\">What to turn in:</font></strong><font size=\"4\" face=\"Garamond\"> Most of these items you just need to do on your own.
