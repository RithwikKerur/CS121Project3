The responsible party shall provide more detailed information, where given the type of data, the circumstances in which they are to be obtained or the use to be made thereof, this is necessary in order to guarantee with respect to the data subject that the processing is carried out in a proper and careful manner.\n<P>\n<B>Article 34</B>\n<P>\n1. Where personal data are obtained in a manner other than that referred to in Article 33, the responsible party shall provide the data subject with the information referred to under (2) and (3), unless the data subject is already acquainted with this information:<BR>\na. at the time that the data relating to him is recorded; or<BR>\nb. when it is intended to supply the data to a third party, at the latest on the first occasion that the said data are so supplied.<BR>\n2. The responsible party shall inform the data subject of its identity and the purposes of the processing.<BR>\n3. The responsible party shall provide more detailed information, where given the type of data, the circumstances in which they have been obtained or the use to be made thereof, this is necessary in order to guarantee with respect to the data subject that the processing is carried out in a proper and careful manner.<BR>\n4. The provisions of (1) do not apply if it appears to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort to provide the said information to the data subject. In that case, the responsible party shall record the origin of the data.<BR>\n5. The provisions of (1) likewise do not apply if the recording or provision of the data is required by or under the law. In that case, the responsible party must inform the data subject, upon his request, about the legal provision which led to the recording or supply of data relating to the data subject.\n<P>\n<B>CHAPTER 6. RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT</B>\n<P>\n<B><a name=\"article35\"></a>Article 35</B>\n<P>\n1. A data subject has the right, freely and at reasonable intervals, to request the responsible party to inform him as to whether personal data relating to him are being processed. The responsible party shall inform the data subject in writing within four weeks as to whether personal data relating to him are being processed.<BR>\n2. In the event that such data are being processed, the information provided shall contain a full and clear summary thereof, a definition of the purpose or purposes of the processing, the data categories to which the processing relates and the recipients or categories of recipients, as well as the available information about the origin of the data.<BR>\n3. Prior to the providing of information referred to under (1) to which a third party may be expected to object, the responsible party shall give the third party an opportunity to express its views where such information contains data concerning that third party unless this appears to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.<BR>\n4. Upon request, the responsible party shall provide information concerning the underlying logic of the automated processing of data relating to the data subject.\n<P>\n<B><a name=\"article36\"></a>Article 36</B>\n<P>\n1. A person who has been informed about personal data relating to him in accordance with Article 35 may request the responsible party to correct, supplement, delete or block the said data in the event that it is factually inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant to the purpose or purposes of the processing, or is being processed in any other way which infringes a legal provision. The request shall contain the modifications to be made.<BR>\n2. The responsible party shall inform the requester in writing within four weeks of receiving the request as to whether and, if so, to what extent, it is complying therewith. A refusal to do so must be accompanied by the reasons.<BR>\n3. The responsible party must make sure that a decision to correct, supplement, delete or block data is implemented as quickly as possible.<BR>\n4. Where personal data have been recorded on a data carrier to which no modifications can be made, the responsible party must take the necessary steps to inform the data user that it is impossible to correct, supplement, delete or block the data, even where there are grounds under this article for modifying the data.<BR>\n5. The provisions of (1) to (4) do not apply to public registers set up by law where this law provides for a special procedure for correcting, supplementing, deleting or blocking data.\n<P>\n<B>Article 37</B>\n<P>\n1. Where an important interest of the requester so requires, the responsible party shall reply to the request referred to in Articles 35 and 36 in a form, other than in writing, which takes due account of this interest.<BR>\n2. The responsible party shall make sure that the identity of the requester is properly established.<BR>\n3. In the case of minors who have not yet reached the age of sixteen, and of persons placed under legal restraint, the requests referred to in Articles 35 and 36 shall be made by their legal representatives. The information concerned shall also be provided to the legal representatives.\n<P>\n<B><a name=\"article38\"></a>Article 38</B>\n<P>\n1. The responsible party who has corrected, supplemented, deleted or blocked personal data in response to a request under Article 36, has an obligation as soon as possible to inform third parties to whom the data has previously been supplied about the correction, addition, deletion or blocking, unless this appears to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.<BR>\n2. Upon request, the responsible party shall notify the requester referred to in Article 36 of those parties to whom it has provided such information.\n<P>\n<B>Article 39</B>\n<P>\n1. The responsible party may require a payment for expenses incurred in providing the information referred to in Article 35, the amount of which shall be laid down by or under general administrative regulation and may not exceed ten Dutch guilder.<BR>\n2. The payment shall be refunded in the event that the responsible party corrects, supplements, deletes or blockes data at the request of the data subject, on the recommendation of the Data Protection Commission or by order of a court.<BR>\n3. The amount referred to under (1) may be modified in special cases by general administrative regulation.\n<P>\n<B><a name=\"article40\"></a>Article 40</B>\n<P>\n1. Where data are undergoing the processing referred to in Article 8(e) and (f), the data subject may at any time register an objection with the responsible party in connection with his particular personal circumstances.<BR>\n2. The responsible party shall take a decision within four weeks of receiving a notice of objection as to whether the objection is justified. In the event that the objection is justified, the responsible party shall stop the processing with immediate effect.<BR>\n3. The responsible party may require a payment for expenses incurred in dealing with an objection, which payment may not exceed an amount to be laid down by or under a general administrative regulation. The payment shall be refunded in the event that the objection is found to be justified.<BR>\n4. This article does not apply to public registers set up by law.\n<P>\n<B><a name=\"article41\"></a>Article 41</B>\n<P>\n1. Where data are being processed in connection with the creation or maintenance of a direct relationship between the responsible party or a third party and the data subject with a view to recruitment for commercial or charitable purposes, the data subject may register an objection to such processing with the responsible party at any time and at no cost to himself.<BR>\n2. In the case of an objection, the responsible party shall take the steps required to stop this form of processing with immediate effect.<BR>\n3. Responsible parties, who are planning to provide personal data to third parties or to use such data at their account for the purposes referred to under (1), shall take appropriate steps to notify the data subjects of the possibility of registering objections. This notification shall be made via one or more newspapers or free-sheets, or in some other suitable way. In the case of regular provision to or use at the account of third parties, the notification shall take place at least once a year.<BR>\n4. Responsible parties processing personal data for the purposes referred to under (1), shall make sure that data subjects are notified of the possibility of registering objections, whenever a direct message is sent to them for the said purposes.\n<P>\n<B>Article 42</B>\n<P>\n1. No one may be subject to a decision to which are attached legal consequences for them, or which affects them to a substantial degree, where this decision has been taken solely on the basis of the automated processing of personal data intended to provide a picture of certain aspects of their personality.<BR>\n2. The provisions of (1) do not apply where the decision referred to therein:<BR>\na. has been taken in connection with the conclusion or execution of a contract, and<BR>\n1\u00ba. the request of the data subjects has been met, or<BR>\n2\u00ba. appropriate measures have been taken to protect their legitimate interests; or<BR>\nb. is based on a law in which measures are laid down for protecting the legitimate interests of data subjects.<BR>\n3. Appropriate measures, as referred to under (2)(a), shall be considered as taken where the data subjects have been given the opportunity to put forward their views on the decisions as referred to under (1).<BR>\n4.  In the case referred to under (2), the responsible party shall inform the data subjects about the underlying logic of the automated processing of the data relating to them.\n<P>\n<B><a name=\"chapter7\"></a>CHAPTER 7. EXCEPTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS</B>\n<P>\n<B>Article 43</B>\n<P>\nResponsible parties are not required to apply Articles 9(1), 30(3), 33, 34 and 35, where this is necessary in the interests of:<BR>\na. State security;<BR>\nb. the prevention, detection and prosecution of criminal offences;<BR>\nc. important economic and financial interests of the State and other public bodies;<BR>\nd. supervising compliance with legal provisions established in the interests referred to under (b) and (c), or<BR>\ne. protecting the data subject or the rights and freedoms of other persons.\n<P>\n<B>Article 44</B>\n<P>\n1. Where processing is carried out by institutions or services for the purposes of scientific research or statistics, and the necessary arrangements have been made to ensure that the personal data can only be used for statistical or scientific purposes, the responsible party shall not be required to provide the information referred to in Article 34 and may refuse to comply with the requests referred to in Article 35.<BR>\n2. Where personal data are being processed which form part of archive records transferred to an archive storage place under Articles 12 or 13 of the Archives Act 1995 <I>(Archiefwet 1995)</I>, the responsible party shall not be required to provide the information referred to in Article 34.\n<P>\n<B>CHAPTER 8. LEGAL PROTECTION</B>\n<P>\n<B>Article 45</B>\n<P>\nA decision taken in response to a request referred to in Articles 30(3), 35, 36 and 38(2), and a decision taken in response to the registering of an objection referred to in Articles 40 or 41, shall be equivalent to a decision within the meaning of the General Administrative Regulations Act, where this decision has been taken by an administrative body.\n<P>\n<B>Article 46</B>\n<P>\n1. Where a decision referred to in Article 45 has been taken by a body other than an administrative body, the party concerned can apply to the district court with a written request to order the responsible party to grant or reject a request referred to in Articles 30(3), 35, 36 or 38(2), or to recognise or reject an objection referred to in Articles 40 or 41.<BR>\n2. The application must be submitted within six weeks of receiving the reply from the responsible party. In the event that the responsible party does not reply within the time limit, the application must be submitted within six weeks of the expiry of this time limit.<BR>\n3. The court shall find in favour of the request where it is ruled to be well-founded. Before handing down a ruling, the court shall, where necessary, give the parties concerned an opportunity to put forward their views.<BR>\n4. The twelfth title of the First Book of the Code of Civil Procedure, with the exception of Article 429d(3), applies. Article 345 of the said Code does not apply.<BR>\n5. The third section of the fifth title of the Second Book of the Code of Civil Procedure is likewise applicable.\n<P>\n<B>Article 47</B>\n<P>\n1. Within the time limit provided for an appeal based on the General Administrative Regulations Act or referred to in Article 46(2), the party concerned may apply to the Data Protection Commission with a request to mediate or give its opinion in the dispute with the responsible party, or make use of the provisions concerning the arrangement of disputes in a code of conduct which has been the subject of a declaration as referred to in Article 25(1). In that case, notwithstanding Article 6:7 of the General Administrative Regulations Act, the appeal may still be lodged or the court proceedings provided for in Article 46 still initiated after the party concerned has received notice from the Data Protection Commission, or further to the provisions concerning the arrangement of disputes in a code of conduct which has been the subject of a declaration as referred to in Article 25(1), that the case has been dealt with, but at the latest six weeks after that moment.<BR>\n2. During the period when the appeal and the proceedings referred to under (1) are being dealt with, the bodies responsible for dealing with the dispute may obtain the opinion of the Data Protection Commission.\n<P>\n<B>Article 48</B>\n<P>\nThe bodies responsible for dealing with the dispute shall send a copy of their verdict to the Data Protection Commission.\n<P>\n<B>Article 49</B>\n<P>\n1. Where any person suffers harm as a consequence of acts concerning him which infringe the provisions laid down by or under this Act, the following paragraphs shall apply, without prejudice to other legal provisions.<BR>\n2. For harm that does not comprise damage to property, the injured party has the right to fair compensation.<BR>\n3. Responsible parties are liable for harm resulting from non-compliance with the provisions referred to under (1). Processors are liable for this harm where this was incurred as a result of their actions.<BR>\n4. Responsible parties or processors may be exempted wholly or partially from this liability where they can prove that the harm cannot be attributed to them.\n<P>\n<B>Article 50</B>\n<P>\n1. Where responsible parties or processors act in contravention of the provisions laid down by or under this Act and other parties sustain, or may sustain, harm as a consequence thereof, the courts may, at the petition of the other parties, impose a ban on such conduct and order them to take measures to remedy the consequences of that conduct.<BR>\n2. Processing cannot form the basis for a claim by a legal person referred to in Article 1:2(3) of the General Administrative Regulations Act or Article 3:305a of the Civil Code, where the persons affected by this processing object thereto.\n<P>\n<B>CHAPTER 9. SUPERVISION</B>\n<P>\n<I>Section 1. The Data Protection Commission</I>\n<P>\n<B>Article 51</B>\n<P>\n1. An <a href=\"http://home.planet.nl/~privacy1/rgk-e.htm\" TARGET=\"Inhoud\">Office of the Data Protection Commission</a> has been established with the task to oversee the processing of personal data in accordance with the provisions laid down by and under the Act. The Commission shall also oversee the processing of personal data in the Netherlands, where the processing takes place in accordance with the laws of another country of the European Union.<BR>\n2. The Commission shall be asked to issue an opinion on bills and draft texts of general administrative regulations relating entirely or substantially to the processing of personal data.\n<P>\n<B>Article 52</B>\n<P>\n1. The Commission shall perform the other tasks vested in it by law and treaty.<BR>\n2. The Commission is independent in the performance of its tasks.\n<P>\n<B>Article 53</B>\n<P>\n1. The Commission comprises a chairperson and two other members. In addition, special members may be appointed to the Commission. In the appointment of special members, all efforts shall be made to reflect the various sectors of society.<BR>\n2. The chairperson must fulfil the requirements governing the appointment of district court judges, as laid down in Article 48(l) of the Judicature Act <I>(Wet op de rechterlijke organisatie)</I>.<BR>\n3. The chairperson shall be appointed by royal decree, on the proposal of Our Minister, for a six-year term. The other two members and the special members shall be appointed by royal decree, on the proposal of Our Minister, for a four-year term. The members may be reappointed immediately thereafter. At their own request, they are discharged by the Minister of Justice.<BR>\n4. An advisory board has been established with the task to advise the Commission on general aspects of the protection of personal data. The members shall be drawn from the various sectors of society and shall be appointed by Our Minister, on the proposal of the Commission.<BR>\nThe term of office and payment of expenses shall be laid down by general administrative regulation.\n<P>\n<B>Article 54</B>\n<P>\n1. Members shall be discharged by royal decree, on the proposal of Our Minister, with effect from the first month following that in which they reach the age of sixty-five.<BR>\n2. Article 11, with the exception of (d)(3\u00ba), and Articles 12, 12a, 13, 13a with the exception of (5), and 13b of the Judicature Act are likewise applicable.\n<P>\n<B>Article 55</B>\n<P>\n1. The chairperson and the two other members shall receive remuneration for their work. The special members shall receive a session fee. In all other matters, their legal position shall be governed by general administrative regulation.<BR>\n2. The chairperson and the two other members may not carry out any other remunerated work where the nature or scale of this work is incompatible with the work for the Commission, without the authorisation of Our Minister.\n<P>\n<B>Article 56</B>\n<P>\n1. The Commission has a secretariat, of which the officials are appointed, suspended and discharged by Our Minister, on the proposal of the chairperson.<BR>\n2. The chairperson shall direct the work of the Commission and the secretariat.<BR>\n3. The Commission shall adopt rules of procedure. These rules shall in any case include provisions relating to the financial management and administrative organisation of the Commission, as well as to working methods and procedures with a view to a proper and careful discharge of its various tasks. The rules shall provide guarantees against the mixing of the supervisory, advisory and enforcement tasks of the Commission. They may also give more detailed provisions for the advisory board referred to in Article 53(4).<BR>\n4. The rules and any modifications thereto shall be sent to Our Minister as quickly as possible and require his or her approval.\n<P>\n<B>Article 57</B>\n<P>\n1. The Commission is represented by the chairperson and the two other members or by one of these persons.<BR>\n2. The members shall allocate responsibilities among them and involve the special members therein as much as possible.\n<P>\n<B>Article 58</B>\n<P>\nThe Commission shall produce an annual report before September on the activities, policy pursued in general and the effectiveness and efficiency of its mode of operation in particular during the preceding calendar year. The report shall be sent to Our Minister and to the data protection officers referred to in Article 62 and made available to the general public.\n<P>\n<B>Article 59</B>\n<P>\n1. The Commission shall provide to Our Minister, upon request, the information necessary to the performance of his or her duties. Our Minister may require business data and records for inspection, where this is necessary to the performance of his or her duties.<BR>\n2. The provisions of (1) do not apply where the Commission has obtained the information from third parties on condition that it is kept confidential.\n<P>\n<B>Article 60</B>\n<P>\n1. The Commission, acting in an official capacity or at the request of an interested party, may initiate an investigation into the manner in which the provisions laid down by or under the Act are being applied with respect to the processing of data.<BR>\n2. The Commission shall present its provisional findings to the responsible party or the group of responsible parties concerned, and allow them to give their views. The Commission shall present these findings also to Our Minister concerned, where they relate to the implementation of any law.<BR>\n3. In the case of an investigation initiated at the request of an interested party, the Commission shall inform the said party of its findings, unless providing such information would be incompatible with the purpose of the data processing or the nature of the personal data, or unless important interests of parties other than the requester, including the responsible party, would sustain disproportionate harm as a consequence. In the event that the Commission does not inform the interested party of its findings, it shall send the said party such information as it deems appropriate.\n<P>\n<B>Article 61</B>\n<P>\n1. Responsibility for the supervision of compliance referred to in Article 51(1) lies with the members and special members of the Commission, the officials of the Commission secretariat and the persons designated by decision of the Commission.<BR>\n2. The persons referred to under (1) are authorised to enter a residence without the consent of the resident.<BR>\n3. The persons referred to under (1) require the express and special authority of the Commission for the purposes of exercising the powers defined under (2), without prejudice to Article 2 of the General Entry Act <I>(Algemene wet op het binnentreden)</I>.<BR>\n4. The Commission is authorised to apply administrative measures of constraint pursuant to Article 5:20(l) of the General Administrative Regulations Act, provided that this concerns the obligation to provide assistance to an official designated by or under (1).<BR>\n5. No appeal is possible on the grounds of a confidentiality obligation, where information or assistance is required in connection with the involvement of the person concerned in the processing of personal data.<BR>\n6. Upon request, the Commission shall provide every assistance to the supervisory authorities of the other member states of the European Union, where this is necessary for the performance of their work.\n<P>\n<I>Section 2. The data protection officer</I>\n<P>\n<B>Article 62</B>\n<P>\nA responsible party or an organisation to which responsible parties are affiliated may appoint its own data protection officer, without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Commission under Chapters 9 and 10 of this Act.\n<P>\n<B>Article 63</B>\n<P>\n1. The only persons who may be appointed as officers are natural persons who possess adequate knowledge for performing their duties and can be regarded as sufficiently reliable.<BR>\n2. With respect to the performances of their duties, officers may not receive any instructions from the responsible party or organisation which appointed them. They shall sustain no disadvantage as a consequence of performing their duties. Responsible parties shall give officers the opportunity to perform their duties properly.<BR>\n3. Officers shall take up their duties only after the responsible party or organisation which appointed them has registered them with the Commission. The Commission shall maintain an up-to-date list of registered officers.<BR>\n4. Officers have an obligation to treat as confidential any information disclosed to them in connection with a complaint or request by data subjects, unless the said data subjects have given their consent thereto.<BR>\n5. Officers shall produce an annual report on their activities and findings.\n<P>\n<B>Article 64</B>\n<P>\n1. Officers shall supervise the processing of personal data in accordance with the provisions laid down by and under the Act. This supervision shall cover the processing of personal data by the responsible party who has appointed them or by the responsible parties affiliated to the organisation which appointed them.<BR>\n2. Where a code of conduct drawn up under Article 25 applies to the processing, the supervision also covers compliance with this code.<BR>\n3. The responsible party or organisation referred to under (1) shall make sure that officers have the authority to perform their duties which is equivalent to that provided for in Section 5.2 of the General Administrative Regulations Act.<BR>\n4. Officers may submit recommendations to the responsible party with a view to improving the protection of the data being processed. In case of doubt, they shall consult the Commission.\n<P>\n<B>CHAPTER 10. SANCTIONS</B>\n<P>\n<I>Section 1. Administrative measures of constraint</I>\n<P>\n<B>Article 65</B>\n<P>\nThe Commission is authorised to apply administrative measures of constraint pursuant to the obligations laid down by or under this Act.\n<P>\n<I>Section 2. Administrative fines</I>\n<P>\n<B>Article 66</B>\n<P>\n1. In the event that responsible parties act in contravention of the provisions laid down by or under Article 27 or 28, the Commission may require them to pay an administrative fine of a maximum amount of ten thousand Dutch guilder.<BR>\n2. The Commission shall not impose a fine where responsible parties give a reasonable explanation as to why they cannot be regarded as responsible for the infringement.<BR>\n3. When deciding the amount of the fine, the Commission shall in any case take into account the seriousness and duration of the infringement.<BR>\n4. The work carried out pursuant to Articles 69 and 70 shall be performed by persons who were not involved in drafting the report and associated prior investigation referred to in Article 67(l).<BR>\n5. The authority to impose fines lapses in the event that, with respect to the infringement on which basis the fine can be imposed, criminal proceedings have been initiated against the infringing party and the investigation by the court has been commenced or the right to pursue criminal proceedings has lapsed under Article 74 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n<P>\n<B>Article 67</B>\n<P>\n1. In the event that the Commission establishes that an infringement referred to in Article 66(1) has been committed and that a fine needs to be imposed for this reason, the Commission shall draw up a report.<BR>\n2. The report shall in any case state the following particulars:<BR>\na. the infringement, with reference to the corresponding legal provision;<BR>\nb. the designation of the place and time at which the infringement was committed;<BR>\nc. the facts and circumstances on which basis it was established that an infringement has been committed.<BR>\n3. A copy of the report shall be sent to the responsible party referred to in Article 66(1).<BR>\n4. At the request of responsible parties who have not understood this report sufficiently owing to an imperfect knowledge of the Dutch language, the Commission shall make every possible effort to ensure that the content of the report is communicated to the said parties in a language which they understand.\n<P>\n<B>Article 68</B>\n<P>\nResponsible parties in respect of whom acts have been carried out for which they can reasonably conclude that a fine will be imposed on them for an infringement, shall not be required to make any statement in relation thereto. The responsible parties shall be informed thereof prior to an oral request for information being submitted to them.\n<P>\n<B>Article 69</B>\n<P>\n1. Notwithstanding Section 4.1.2 of the General Administrative Regulations Act, the Commission shall give the responsible parties referred to in Article 66(l) the opportunity to put forward their views in writing or orally, at their choice, within a reasonable period of time.<BR>\n2. In the case that responsible parties referred to in Article 66(l) wish to put forward their views and do not have sufficient understanding of the Dutch language, upon the request of the responsible parties, the Commission shall see to it that an interpreter is appointed who can assist the said parties, unless it can reasonably be assumed that this is not necessary.\n<P>\n<B>Article 70</B>\n<P>\n1. Fines shall be imposed by decision of the Commission.<BR>\n2. The decision shall in all cases state the following:<BR>\na. the sum of money to be paid;<BR>\nb. the infringement for which the fine has been imposed, with reference to the corresponding legal provision;<BR>\nc. the particulars referred to in Article 67(2)(b) and (c).<BR>\n3. At the request of responsible parties who have not understood the decision sufficiently owing to an imperfect knowledge of the Dutch language, the Commission shall make every possible effort to ensure that the content of the decision is communicated to the said parties in a language which they understand.\n<P>\n<B>Article 71</B>\n<P>\nDecisions taken under Article 70 shall be inoperative until the deadline for making objections has expired or, where an objection has been made, until a decision has been taken on the objection.\n<P>\n<B>Article 72</B>\n<P>\nThe authority to impose a fine lapses five years after the infringement has been committed.\n<P>\n<B>Article 73</B>\n<P>\n1. A fine shall be payable within six weeks of the decision imposing the fine entering into force.<BR>\n2. Where fines have not been paid within the time limit stipulated under (1), the parties owing the fines shall be sent notice in writing to pay the amount of the fine, plus the costs of the notice to pay, within two weeks.<BR>\n3 . Where payment is not made within the time limit stipulated under (2), the Commission can issue an order to pay the fine owing, plus the costs of the notice to pay and order to pay.<BR>\n4. Orders to pay shall be served by bailiff\u2019s writ, at the expense of the persons owing the fines, and shall be enforceable within the meaning of the Second Book of the Code of Civil Procedure.<BR>\n5. For six weeks following the day on which the writ is served, objections to the order to pay may be made by a writ against the State.<BR>\n6. The objection has the effect of suspending execution. At the request of the State, the courts may cancel the suspension of execution.\n<P>\n<B>Article 74</B>\n<P>\nOur Minister may decide on policy provisions governing the execution of the powers of the Commission to impose fines.\n<P>\n<I>Section 3. Penal sanctions</I>\n<P>\n<B>Article 75</B>\n<P>\n1. Responsible parties who act in contravention of the provisions laid down by or under Articles 4(3), 27, 28 or 78(2)(a), shall be punished with a fine coming under the second category.<BR>\n2. Responsible parties who deliberately commit an offence referred to under (1) shall be punished with a prison sentence for a maximum of six months or a fine coming under the third category.<BR>\n3. The punishable offences under (1) are petty offences. The punishable offences under (2) are indictable offences.<BR>\n4. Besides the officials designated by or under Article 141 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the officials from the secretariat of the Commission designated for this purpose by Our Minister are also responsible for detecting the offences defined in this article.<BR>\n5. The right to pursue criminal proceedings lapses where the Commission has already imposed a fine.\n<P>\n<B><a name=\"chapter11\"></a>CHAPTER 11.  TRANSFER OF DATA TO COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION</B>\n<P>\n<B>Article 76</B>\n<P>\n1. Personal data which are subject to processing or intended for processing after they have been transferred, shall only be transferred to a country outside the European Union in the case that, without prejudice to compliance with the provisions of this Act, that country guarantees an adequate level of protection.<BR>\n2. An assessment of the adequacy of the level of protection shall take account of the circumstances affecting a data transfer operation or a category of data tranfer operations.  Account shall be taken in particular of the type of data, the purpose or purposes and the duration of the planned processing or processing operations, the country of origin and country of final destination, the general and sectoral legal provisions applying in the non-member country concerned, as well as the rules governing the business sector and security rules applying in these countries.\n<P>\n<B><a name=\"article77\"></a>Article 77</B>\n<P>\n1 .
