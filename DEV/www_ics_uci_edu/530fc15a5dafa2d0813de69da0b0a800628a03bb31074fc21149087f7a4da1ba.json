playing time: ~3 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/paperchase/02thestudyoflaw.wmv\">Clip 2</a>:\r\nKingsfield explains the Socratic method of teaching.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~1.5 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/paperchase/03threefactions.wmv\">Clip 3</a>:\r\nHart tells his girfriend (they are in bed together, but there is no nudity)\r\n  about the three factions of students at Harvard, and vows to enter the upper\r\n  echelon in Kingsfield's class.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~1.5 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/paperchase/04photographicmemory.wmv\">Clip 4</a>:\r\nKingfield responds to one of Hart's classmates, who has a photographic\r\n  memory.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~.5 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/paperchase/05redset.wmv\">Clip 5</a>:\r\nHart and and his friend/confidant Ford break into the \"red set room\" in\r\n  the Law Library to read the notes that Kingfield took in his contract\r\n  law class, when he was a first year student.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~3.5 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/paperchase/06deadman.wmv\">Clip 6</a>:\r\nHart approaches Kingsfield after class to further discuss a point, and\r\n  gets a job from him.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~2.5 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<b>Note:</b> I had to edit out a few words to ensure that this clip\r\n  doesn't disclose a plot twist.<br>\r\n<a href=\"videos/paperchase/07discussion-pass.wmv\">Clip 7</a>:\r\nHart discusses Kingsfield with his girlfriend, and in the next\r\n  scene \"passes\" when asked a question by Kingsfield in class.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~3.5 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/paperchase/08elevator.wmv\">Clip 8</a>:\r\nAfter taking his final exam in contracts, Hart runs into Kingsfield\r\n  in the elevator, and tells him the impact Kingsfield and his class has\r\n  had on Hart.\r\nA major part of the movie concerns the many levels of interaction between\r\n  Hart and Kingsfield (many of those interactions are missing from these\r\n  clips).\r\nNote what happens when Kingsfield asks Hart a surprising question:\r\n  the slow take and look on Hart's face is all-telling.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~1 minute.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"100\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<i>Dead Poets Society</i> is my all-time favorite movie for teachers (for\r\n  students, it is <i>The Paper Chase</i> see above).\r\nI try to watch it before every semester starts.\r\nThe older I get the further away I get from the aspirations and\r\n  life-experiences of my students, who are mostly barely out of high school,\r\n  and now at a new and wonderful place, with millions of \"distractions\"\r\n  competing for their attention.\r\nThis movie helps me recenter my thoughts.\r\nKingsfield and Keating, while appearing adjacent in the alphabet, are poles\r\n  apart in their teaching styles: in their own ways, both are mesmerizing and\r\n  unforgetable educators.\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Dead Poets Society</i> follows a group of seniors through the first half of\r\n  their last year at a New England prep school, and the effect a new English\r\n  teacher, Mr. Keating, has on their lives.\r\n<p>\r\nThe clips below are a few of my favorite (short) scenes, in the order they\r\n  appeared in the film, providing a glimpse of Mr. Keating's teaching style.\r\nWatched individually, they do not provide much of a narrative of the film,\r\n  as most of this \"coming of age\" story occurs outside of the classroom.\r\nSo of course, I recommend skipping these clips now and watching the\r\n  entire movie first.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/deadpoets/01FirstClass.wmv\">Clip 1</a>:\r\nOn the first day of classes, Keating introduces himself to the boys and \r\n introduces them to the phrase \"Carpe Diem\" -seize the day- and tells them\r\n  to \"make their lives extraordinary\".<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~5.5 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/deadpoets/02RippingPages.wmv\">Clip 2</a>:\r\nThe boys read an essay about measuring poetry, titled \"Understanding Poetry\"\r\n  by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph.D. in the introduction to their textook.\r\nWarning: includes scenes of extreme violence to textbooks.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~6 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/deadpoets/03NewPerspective.wmv\">Clip 3</a>:\r\nBy standing on his desk, Keating reminds the boys that \"we must constantly\r\n  look at things in a different way.\"\r\nHe assigns each to compose a poem of his own, to be delivered aloud in \r\n  class.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~2 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/deadpoets/04Soccer.wmv\">Clip 4</a>:\r\nKeating teaches a short lesson on the soccer field.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~1.5 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/deadpoets/05ReadingPoems.wmv\">Clip 5</a>:\r\nIn class, the boys read the poems that they composed.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~4 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/deadpoets/06Conformity.wmv\">Clip 6</a>:\r\nKeating teaches a lesson on conformity.\r\n<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~2 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"100\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nIn 1961, CBS (one of the three national networks) ran a show called\r\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvOTKFXpvKA\">\r\n  The Thinking Machine</a> describing early work in Artificial Intelligence.\r\nIt was part of a series on science and technology celebrating MIT's centenially\r\n  year.\r\nThe program is hosted by David Wayne (an actor) and Jerome Wiesner (a professor\r\n  of Electrical Engineering at MIT; later its president).\r\nIt introduces various researchers (mostly from MIT, but some from other schools)\r\n  studying intelligence, both natural and artificial.\r\nThis link is to a <b>YouTube</b> video of this program (whose text was published\r\n  in a book by the same title, written by John Pfeiffer).\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe following videos show demos that changed the face of Computer Science.\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"videos/classicdemos/doug_engelbart.wmv\">\r\n  Douglas Engelbart</a>:\r\n\"This is an edited record of Douglas Engelbart's historic presentation\r\n  of the NLS System at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco,\r\n  on December 8, 1968.\r\nThe video captuers what was projected onto a 22'x18/ screen at a\r\n  2000-chair convention center.\r\nThe soundtrack reproduces what came over the loud speakers.\r\nOn stage was Doug Enbelbart at the controls of an on-line computer\r\n  display whose output was projected onto the screen.\r\nBehind the scenes, Bill English and the crew manned cameras and signal\r\n  switchers, connecting the conference center with SRI, 30 miles away.\r\nMany concepts in today's interfaces were first introduced in the NLS system\r\n  and this presentation.\r\nThese include: modern word processing, outlining and hypermedia,\r\n  a  mouse and 1-hand keyboard, shared files, messaging, email and filtering,\r\n  video desktop conferencing.\"\r\n<p>\r\nEngelbart is most well know as the inventor of the mouse.\r\nIn the early 60s, he did groundbreaking work at SRI (formerly the Stanford\r\n  Research Institute) on the augmentation of human intellect.\r\nThis work was a direct outgrowth of the Vannevar Bush's Memex, and the\r\n  work done by J.C.R. Licklider on Man-Computer symbiosis.\r\nFor more information on Engelbart, see Bardini,\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0804738718/qid=1126447044/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-2375611-7993762?v=glance&s=books\">\r\n  Boostrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal\r\n  Computing</a>,\r\nStanford University, 2000.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~21 minutes.</i>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"videos/classicdemos/sketchpad_long.wmv\">\r\n  Ivan Sutherlad - Sketchpad</a>:\r\nThis video is a TV show made about the software Ivan Sutherland developed in\r\n  his 1963 thesis at MIT's Lincoln Labs, \"Sketchpad, A Man-Machine Graphical\r\n  Communication System\", described as one of the most influential computer\r\n  programs ever written.\r\nThis work was seminal in Human-Computer Interaction,  Graphics and Graphical\r\n  User Interfaces (GUIs), Computer Aided Design (CAD), and\r\n  contraint/object-oriented programming.\r\nWhile watching this video, remember that the TX-2 computer (built circa 1958)\r\n  on which the software ran was built from discrete transistors (not integrated\r\n  circuits -it was room-sized) and contained just 64K of 36-bit words\r\n  (~272k bytes).\r\nFor more information, you can view/download a <b>.pdf</b> file of\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/TechReports/UCAM-CL-TR-574.pdf\">\r\n  Sutherland's Thesis</a>\r\na remarkably clear presentation of his ideas.<br>\r\n<i>Format: Microsoft Media Player; playing time: ~21 minutes.</i>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
