This presentation\nwill cover a paper by Blandford and Blelloch that provides a method\nfor\nrepresenting an ordered set within a constant factor of the\ntheoretical\nlower bound.  While not improving significantly on previous space\nbounds,\nit does provide a larger set of useful functionality over previous\ncompressed set storage methods.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
