For example, for a boolean formula\n&phi; on <i>n</i> variables, the associated property <i>P<sub>&phi;</sub></i> is a\ncollection of <i>n</i>-bit strings that satisfy &phi;. The authors prove that\nthere are 3CNF properties (properties for boolean formulae in 3CNF\nform) that require a linear number of queries, even for adaptive\ntests. In contrast, it is known that 2CNF properties can be tested\nwith <i>O(sqrt(n))</i> queries. I will briefly indroduce property testing\nand present the proof of hardness of 3CNF properties testing.\n<p>\nThis paper appeared in STOC'03.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
