But you can still catch our app's main features by going through the below sections.<br>\n\n<h2>Introduction - We change the way people see and use Facebook</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Offline Facebook</span> is an app which lets users interact with Facebook in an offline manner. It is totally\r\nfree and has no mobile advertisements. The goal of the app is to enable you to access and interact with Facebook, offline, even when you have\r\nno Internet connection. Offline Facebook complements the original Facebook Mobile, by allowing you\r\nto check your Facebook News Feeds, write status, and upload photos/videos to Facebook whenever you\r\nwant without the restriction of network availability. Offline Facebook silently prefetches Facebook News\r\nFeeds onto your phone and sends out posts/comments/likes as scheduled by user or when the Internet\r\nbecomes available. It monitors which network should be used (in case you do not want to use your\r\nlimited data plan) and monitor energy consumption on your phone. Many more features will be added\r\nto the app soon.\n\n<p>\n<iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/lVlJFD1KAUQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n\r\n<h2>Download and install</h2>\r\nDownload the .apk file from the above link. The app currently is under internal\r\ntest, and only avaialbe and distributed as the .apk file. We will make\r\nthe app available in the market (Google Play) soon. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nTo install the app, you should set checkbox \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unknown sources</span>\" checked by choosing \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Settings</span>\" and then \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Security</span>\". This would allow you to install \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">non-Market</span>\" apps. You now use your phone to browse this webpage, and download the file to\r\nyour phone. Do this by doing a \"long\" click to the above link and then select \"<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Save link</span>\". After the file is downloaded, from the drop-down menu, click to the file and install.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nRequirement: You should have Android >= 3.0 to run the app.\r\n<h2>How to use?<br>\r\n</h2>\r\nThe current version provides you the following benefits. Many more\r\nfeatures\r\nwill be added soon to create an \"Offline\" Facebook ecosystem.\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p class=\"auto-style1\">News Feeds with photos and videos embeded\r\nare available for viewing, and displayed faster even when you lose your\r\nInternet connection.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p class=\"auto-style1\">Interact with News Feeds by liking or\r\ncommenting Feeds. You can even schedule when your \"Like\" or \"Comment\"\r\nis sent out. Isn't it funny? Give your boy/girlfriend \"Good night\"\r\nmessage even when you are hanging out with your buddies. If the\r\nInternet is not\r\navailble at the time \"Like\" or \"Comment\" is supposed to be sent,\r\nthe app would trigger the sending right at the time you get the\r\nInternet back.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li>\r\n    <p class=\"auto-style1\">Write a status/photo/video post\r\nto your own wall. Of course, you can schedule to send it.</p>\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe following pictures give you little idea of how to use the app. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<table style=\"text-align: left; width: 100%;\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\">\r\n  <tbody>\r\n    <tr>\r\n      <td style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\"><img style=\"width: 283px; height: 472px;\" alt=\"Main GUI\" src=\"images/image1.png\"><br>\r\n      <big style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(248, 8, 37);\">1.

Settings</big><br>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table><br>\r\nThis is a more detailed guidance on how to schedule a post (comment,\r\nlike or a status). To like or comment a post, you click to the button \">\" as shown in the below figure (the left button\r\nallows you to save a feed forever, otherwise a feed will be deleted after 5 days).\r\nIt shows you the detail of a feed. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img src=\"images/imagestar.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\nYou can like a feed if there are buttons \"Like\" and\r\nCalendar (see Figure 2). If the buttons are not there, this means the poster does not want to like his/her post.\r\nIf you click to \"Like\", the request will be sent right away. So, you\r\nmust have Internet connection to send the request. Otherwise, an\r\nerror is reported to you \"Fail to like\". In the case you do not have\r\nthe Internet, you should click to the Calendar button. It allows you to\r\nschedule when the like should be sent. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<img style=\"width: 376px; height: 204px;\" src=\"images/imageschedule.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>\"Send After\"</b> is the time when the scheduled like should be sent.&nbsp;\r\n<b>\"Valid Through\"</b> is the time at which the scheduled like is still valid before it is\r\ndeleted by the app. It is possible because the app fails\r\nto send the like before \"Valid Through\" (due to no Internet access).\r\nDuring \"Send After\" and \"Valid Through\", whenever the Internet is up,\r\nthe like will be sent. For any scheduled like that has not been sent yet, you can\r\nmanage them at <b>\"Scheduled Actions\"</b> menu.<br>\r\n<h2>Terms of Services</h2>\r\nBy using our app, you agree to the following terms.
