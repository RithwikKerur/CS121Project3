That is, K<sub>3</sub> and\nK<sub>4</sub> have linear subgraph multiplicity.\nThis paper shows that the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in\nthe planar graphs are exactly the 3-connected planar graphs.\nAlso, the graphs with linear subgraph multiplicity in the outerplanar\ngraphs are exactly the 2-connected outerplanar graphs.\n<p>\nMore generally, let F be a minor-closed family, and let x be the\nsmallest number such that some complete bipartite graph K<sub>x,y</sub>\nis a forbidden minor for F. Then the x-connected graphs have linear\nsubgraph multiplicity for F, and there exists an\n(x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1)-connected graph (namely\nK<sub>x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1,x&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sub>) that does not\nhave linear subgraph multiplicity.\nWhen x&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;3 or when x&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 and the minimal\nforbidden minors for F are triangle-free, then the graphs with linear\nsubgraph multiplicity for F are exactly the x-connected graphs.\n<p>\nPlease refer only to the journal version, and not the earlier technical\nreport: the technical report had a bug that was repaired in the journal\nversion.\n<p>(<a href=\"/~eppstein/bibs/eppstein.html#Connectivity, graph minors, and subgraph multiplicity\">BibTeX</a> &ndash;\n<a href=\"//fano.ics.uci.edu/cites/Document/Connectivity-graph-minors-and-subgraph-multiplicity.html\">Citations</a>)\n<p>\n<li><b>Subgraph isomorphism in planar graphs and related problems</b>.<br>\nD.

Specifically,\nminor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there\nexists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph\nthat can be made planar by removing a single vertex.\nThe minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have\nbounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus\ngraphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the\ntreewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As\na consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and\napproximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed\nefficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar\ngraphs.\n<p>Some of these results\nwere announced in the conference version of\n\"<a href=\"p-psgi.html\">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related\nproblems</a>\" but not included in the journal version. Since its\npublication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of\nproblems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local\ntreewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, \"<a\nhref=\"//doi.org/10.1145/504794.504798\">Deciding first-order\nproperties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>\", <i>J.
