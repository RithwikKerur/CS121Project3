We consider\nthe problem of positioning the root of a star such that the dilation\nof the resulting graph is minimal.  We present a deterministic\n<I>O</I>(<I>n</I>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<I>n</I>)-time solution\nto the decision problem, as well as a randomized\n<I>O</I>(<I>n</I>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<I>n</I>)\nexpected-time solution to the optimization problem.\n<P>\nThe talk will cover selected results from a paper currently under \npreparation.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
