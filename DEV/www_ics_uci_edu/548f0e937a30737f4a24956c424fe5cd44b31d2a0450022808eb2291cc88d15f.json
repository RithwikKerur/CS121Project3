The algorithms are\nbased on the Goemans-Williamson 2-approximation algorithm along with the\nbest approximation algorithms we currently have for each one of the\nordinary versions of these problems.  The important part investigated,\nis the application of the latter algorithms onto specific subsets of\nvertices the former algorithm spans.  This survey solves an open problem\nstanding for more than 15 years in the area of Prize-Collecting\nproblems, by providing a guarantee which is strictly less than 2.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on a paper by Aaron Archer, MohammadHossein Bateni, Mohammad\nTaghi Hajiaghayi, and Howard Karloff from FOCS 2009.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
