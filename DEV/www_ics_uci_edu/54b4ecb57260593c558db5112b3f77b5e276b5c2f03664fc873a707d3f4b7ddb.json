Thus I see efficient management of large\n&gt;web sites helped by CM capabilities working in tandem with versioning\n&gt;capabilities, not simply by versioning capabilities alone.\n\nTo a great extent this is true. Should we be expanding this document to\ncover CM, or just delete this point, for a future requirements document?\nDoesn't even simple versioning help manage somewhat, if only by offering an\naudit trail and improved accountability (depending on the kinds of server\nlogs and access control the server implements)? While I think that this is\npart of the larger rationale, it could be postpond to the CM requirements,\nif people agree.\n\n&gt;The second bullet, \"(Versioning) allows concurrent and controlled access to\n&gt;resources by authors and editors\" is at once too broad and too restrictive.\n&gt;Too broad, because browsers already handle concurrent and controlled\n&gt;access to resources: they serve the resource concurrently to everyone who\n&gt;asks for it (excepting cases where the resource is password protected).\n&gt;Too restrictive, because the potential roles of people employing versioning\n&gt;capabilities is far greater than simply authors and editors.  Computer\n&gt;programmers, reviewers, managers, students, etc. are all people whose roles\n&gt;both fall, and don't fall under \"authors and editors.\"\n   What we meant are people who make changes and people who create\ndocuments. Personally I don't have a problem using author to refer to\nanyone who creates a web document, whether program, home page, term paper,\nor novel. Shall we use the rather uglier terms \"resource creators\" and\n\"resource updaters\" instead? Or should we add a definition of the terms\nthat stresses their wide-ranging applicability?\n\n&gt;However, I think this bullet does get at the essence of one of the most\n&gt;important capabilities versioning should provide: parallel development\n&gt;support, the ability for two or more people to simultaneously edit a\n&gt;resource.  The second issue alluded to in this bullet is access control, in\n&gt;many versioning schemes a necessary support capability for parallel\n&gt;development.\n\nThese are indeed the points we were shooting at.\n\n&gt; Thus I think the \"concurrent and controlled access\" bullet\n&gt;should be subdivided into two bullets:\n&gt;\n&gt;- Versioning provides parallel development support\n&gt;- Versioning provides access control over resources\n\n    I will make these changes without further discussion.\n\n&gt;The bullet stating that versioning enhances annotation support due to the\n&gt;preservation of the historical record merges several points which should be\n&gt;separated:\n&gt;- Versioning provides a consistent naming scheme for versions of a resource\nThe more I think about this one, the more it seems tautological (basically,\nall it says is that keeping track of versions lets us keep track of\nversions -- not too thrilling). I will delete this point and  rewrite your\ntwo points:\n\n&gt;This supports two major rationales for versioning:\n&gt;- browse access to previous versions of a resource\n&gt;- annotation support\n\nWe had quite some discussion of this. It's awkward because we wanted to\nhave the rationale provide axioms, that lead to functional requirements,\nthat will then constrain the architecture... So we thought that combining\nthem makes sense. In fact, annotation support is in a way too limiting,\nsince one of the virtues of versioning support is also the support of\nversion-aware links, and externally stored links, even in non-annotative\ncontexts.\n\n   So we should change the two bullets to something like the following:\n- we allow browsing through the past and alternative versions of a resource.\n- we can support externally stored links, allowing annotations, and\nmore-flexible linking.\n- we can support configuration control of consistent sets of linked resources,\n\n    -- David\n\n----------------------------------------------+----------------------------\n  David Durand                 <a href=\"mailto:dgd@cs.bu.edu\">dgd@cs.bu.edu</a>  | david@dynamicDiagrams.com\n  Boston University Computer Science          | Dynamic Diagrams\n  <a href=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu:80/students/grads/dgd/\">http://cs-www.bu.edu:80/students/grads/dgd/</a> | http://dynamicDiagrams.com/\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0102.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"San Mateo meeting notes\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0100.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Comments on Rationale\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe in reply to:</b> <a href=\"0100.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Comments on Rationale\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
