In fact, every time one\ncombines and records facts in accordance with established logical\nprocesses, the creative aspect of thinking is concerned only with the\nselection of the data and the process to be employed, and the\nmanipulation thereafter is repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter\nto be relegated to the machines.  Not so much has been done along\nthese lines, beyond the bounds of arithmetic, as might be done,\nprimarily because of the economics of the situation.  The needs of\nbusiness, and the extensive market obviously waiting, assured the\nadvent of mass-produced arithmetical machines just as soon as\nproduction methods were sufficiently advanced.\n\n<p>\n\nWith machines for advanced analysis no such situation existed; for\nthere was and is no extensive market; the users of advanced methods of\nmanipulating data are a very small part of the population.  There are,\nhowever, machines for solving differential equations - and functional\nand integral equations, for that matter.  There are many special\nmachines, such as the harmonic synthesizer which predicts the tides.\nThere will be many more, appearing certainly first in the hands of the\nscientist and in small numbers.\n\n<p>\n\nIf scientific reasoning were limited to the logical processes of\narithmetic, we should not get far in our understanding of the physical\nworld.  One might as well attempt to grasp the game of poker entirely\nby the use of the mathematics of probability.  The abacus, with its\nbeads string on parallel wires, led the Arabs to positional numeration\nand the concept of zero many centuries before the rest of the world;\nand it was a useful tool - so useful that it still exists.\n\n<p>\n\nIt is a far cry from the abacus to the modern keyboard accounting\nmachine.  It will be an equal step to the arithmetical machine of the\nfuture.  But even this new machine will not take the scientist where\nhe needs to go.  Relief must be secured from laborious detailed\nmanipulation of higher mathematics as well, if the users of it are to\nfree their brains for something more than repetitive detailed\ntransformations in accordance with established rules.  A mathematician\nis not a man who can readily manipulate figures; often he cannot.  He\nis not even a man who can readily perform the transformation of\nequations by the use of calculus.  He is primarily an individual who\nis skilled in the use of symbolic logic on a high plane, and\nespecially he is a man of intuitive judgment in the choice of the\nmanipulative processes he employs.\n\n<p>\n\nAll else he should be able to turn over to his mechanism, just as\nconfidently as he turns over the propelling of his car to the\nintricate mechanism under the hood.  Only then will mathematics be\npractically effective in bringing the growing knowledge of atomistics\nto the useful solution of the advanced problems of chemistry,\nmetallurgy, and biology.  For this reason there will come more\nmachines to handle advanced mathematics for the scientist.  Some of\nthem will be sufficiently bizarre to suit the most fastidious\nconnoisseur of the present artifacts of civilization.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Next:</b> <a href=\"section5.html\">Section 5</a>,\n<b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"section3.html\">Section 3</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
