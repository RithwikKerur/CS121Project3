We first show that one\ncan simplify this to finding a shortest path in a grid of quadrilaterals\n(which has the complication of having paths traveling on a boundary\naround the grid).  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe only previously published approximation algorithm gives a factor\nof 2 approximation to the shortest path in O(n log n).  We use the\nsimpler grid structure to give a much better approximation algorithm.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a preliminary version of what will be a job talk.  The\nassociated paper is to be submitted for publication.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
