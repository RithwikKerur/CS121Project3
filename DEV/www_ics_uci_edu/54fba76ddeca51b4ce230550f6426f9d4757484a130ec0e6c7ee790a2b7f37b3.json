If you have to miss lecture for any\r\nreason, please ask one of your classmates to fill you\r\nin on what you missed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are two discussion sections for this class. Each section meets one hour per\r\nweek. This is an important time to get questions answered about homework\r\nproblems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Obtaining Assistance</h3>\r\nThe best way to get your questions answered is by coming\r\nto lecture, office hours or discussion and asking them there.\r\nIn general,\r\nif I'm not busy with something else, I am happy to answer\r\nshort questions while I am in my office, so feel free to\r\nstop by during other times in the week.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll email with questions about course material should be sent to the\r\nfollowing email address:\r\n<A href=\"mailto:ics6b-questions@ics.uci.edu\">ics6b-questions@ics.uci.edu</A>.\r\nThis is an alias for the instructor, the TA and the readers.  It ensures\r\nthat we all see your message and the response.  It also gives you better\r\nturnaround time.\r\n<LI>Please also include the following information:\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> The string \"ICS 6B:\" at the beginning of the subject line\r\n<LI> Your name\r\n<LI> Your student number\r\n</UL>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor questions about grading on  homework, please go to the office hours of\r\none of the readers or you can send an email to them directly.\r\nFor questions about grading on quizes, you can either ask Zach or me.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<H3>Course Announcements</H3>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>Course announcements will be sent via email to all students enrolled\r\nin the class, at their official UCI email address.\r\n<LI>\r\n<A  href=\" https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/f13/36522/\">Click here</A> for the\r\narchive of these messages.\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Homework and Quizes</h3>\r\n\r\nOn each Monday, a new homework assignment will be posted\r\nto the class web page.\r\nThe new homework covers the material that presented in lecture\r\nthat week.\r\nThe homework is due the following Wednesday in lecture.\r\nThe homework will be graded by the following Tuesday and can\r\nbe picked up in discussion section.\r\nThe purpose of discussion section on Tuesday and Thursday afternoon\r\nis to answer any questions\r\nyou may have on the graded homework in preparation for the quiz\r\nthat will given on Friday morning in lecture.\r\nNo solutions to homework or quizes are distributed.\r\nThe purpose of discussion sections and office hours are to answer any\r\nquestions you may have about solutions to quizes or homeworks.\r\nYou are highly advised to learn the correct\r\nsolution to quizes and homeworks since I will typically\r\nre-use a couple questions (perhaps with some minor modifications)\r\nfrom homework on quizes and will take some final exam\r\nquestions from the quizes.\r\n<p>\r\n<strong> Absolutely no late homework assignments will be accepted.\r\n</strong>.\r\n<p>\r\nThe weekly quiz will be given every Friday\r\nat the beginning of lecture.\r\nThe quiz will be handed out at <strong> 9:00 AM, sharp </strong>\r\nand will be picked up at <strong> 9:15 AM, sharp </strong>.\r\n<strong>\r\nThere will be no make-up quizes given.\r\n</strong>\r\nWhen we tabulate your final grade, we will drop the two lowest quiz\r\nscores and the two lowest homework scores. However, in exchange for this,\r\nwe will make absolutely no allowances if you arrive at a quiz late or\r\nturn in your homework late. This holds even if you have a perfectly\r\nvalid reason to miss a homework assignment or a quiz. If for some\r\nreason you fail\r\nto make it to a quiz or hand in a homework assignment, that will count\r\nas one of your dropped quizes or homework assignments, no matter\r\nhow legitimate your reason is.\r\n<p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere will also be one midterm on Monday of week 6.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrades for the assignements and quizes will be posted through EEE.\r\nIf you have questions regarding grading, please see the person who\r\ngraded that particular item.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Text</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis quarter you will be using a web-based interactive, animated offering as your \"textbook\".

It is\r\navailable through <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/\"> EEE </a> and is\r\nusually released a couple  weeks from the end of the quarter.\r\nIf enough students complete the evaluation then I have access to the list of students\r\nwho completed the evaluation. However, I do not see any evaluation results until the\r\nquarter is over and grades have been turned in. Even after the quarter when I do\r\nsee the evaluation results, they are completely anonymous. Thus, there is no risk\r\nto you in being completely honest in your evaluation. I take these evaluations very\r\nseriously and use them to improve my teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H3>Missed Midtern or Final Exam Policy</H3>\r\nThe final exam will be on Wednesday, December 11, 8:00AM-10:00AM.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> If you miss the final exam and do not have a valid reason, you will receive\r\na score of 0 on the exam.\r\n<LI> The following policy applies if you miss the final exam for a valid reason.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>\r\nThere are only two classes of valid reasons for missing the final exam:\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>  An unforeseeable emergency, such as a medical emergency.\r\nIn such cases I will ask for documentation.\r\n<LI> An absence from an exam due to a foreseeable circumstance\r\nthat I have approved in advance.\r\n</OL>\r\n<LI>\r\nA work conflict is NOT a valid reason for missing the final exam.\r\nThe examination times\r\nare announced at the beginning of the quarter, so there is plenty of\r\ntime to plan your work schedule.\r\n<LI> If you wait until after the exam to get a foreseeable excuse approved,\r\nand it is not approved,\r\nyou will receive a grade of zero (0) on the exam.\r\n<LI> If I accept your reason for missing the final exam, at my option I may\r\neither (1) give you a makeup exam or (2) assign your grade on the basis\r\nof the remaining course work that you did not miss.\r\n<LI> If I give a makeup exam, I may give it less weight\r\nthan announced on the course web page.\r\n</UL>\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>\r\n    <p>The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established an academic honesty policy. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">Read it.</a></p>\r\n    <p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n    <h4>Guidelines to avoid plagarism:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>Do not look at another person's homework.</b>\r\n      Instead you should prefer to discuss the problem in plain English.\r\n      This helps you to communicate clearly, practice technical jargon as it applies to your problem, and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior different from what you expect.\r\n      <li><b>Do not write down the solution in your notes.</b>\r\n      It is perfectly fine (and encouraged) to collborate on work.\r\n      Working in a group is a rewarding experience, and definitely a necessary skill in any professional career.\r\n      The collaboration can include drawing diagrams and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard.\r\n      However, you should avoid writing the solution in your notes.\r\n      It is very useful to rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you solve it again on your own.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>We expect that:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among yourselves.</b> Making sure that others follow these guidelines will help to ensure that they don't pass off your work as their own.</p>\r\n      <li><b>Your work honestly represents your efforts.</b> The entire purpose of obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of skills and experience that will help you later on. If you do not perform the work yourself, then you have cheated yourself out of the education. Employers in our field can (and do) screen applicants for skills and knowledge. You will perform poorly (and discredit UCI) if you do not practice now by doing your own work.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
