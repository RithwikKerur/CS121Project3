The mailing list is the final\narbiter of consensus on any issue.  Note also, that the revised\nBindings Protocol specification produced as a result of this\nconference call will also be subject to review by the mailing\nlist. ***\n\n\nIssue #14 (Bind Syntax): Revisiting this issue, since it appears we\ndidn't address all of Yaron's concerns.  Decided that should weak\nbindings be created in the future, they should be created using a\ndifferent method. Thus, concerns regarding weak bindings should not be\nused to determine the syntax of the bind method. That said, decided to\nagree with Roy's comment, and have the Request-URI be the collection\nthat is being operated on to add a new binding.  A separate header,\nTarget (or Ref-target), will name the resource that is being bound-to.\nAnother header, BindingName, would give the new name of the binding\n(in the collection identified by the Request-URI).\n\nDiscussed whether a change to the dav:bindings property should cause a\nchange to the Etag.  Agreed that changes to bindings property should\nnot affect the Etag, since the property modification shouldn't affect\nthe caching of the body of the resource.\n\nNeed to modify the spec. such that OPTIONS requests are issued to the\ncollection to determine whether bindings can be made to it.\n\nAlso discussed whether you need read access to the resource being\nbound-to in order to create/remove a binding to it.  Agreed that you\ndo not need read access, although this should not be mentioned in the\nspec., since we don't have an access control spec., and this could be\narguably a server policy issues.\n\nIssue #17 (ApplePieToo): Agreed to use Judy's Proposal #1 language,\nmade in her Feb. 2 post.\n\nIssue #19 (MrIntegrity): Agreed to remove term \"integrity\" except for\ntitle of section that discusses it. We will instead define it in terms\nof individual MUST level requirements that capture the desired intent\n(behavior wrt DELETE, MOVE, overwrite behavior of other methods). In\nthe BIND method, need to explicitly state which requirements must be\nsatisfied (DELETE/MOVE/overwrite against the binding) or the method\nmust fail.  Geoff will submit to the list the desired language for the\nBIND method section.  Jim will engage Roy's email posts to ensure we\nhave addressed his concerns. Go into details of dav:resourceid\nproperty behavior in PROPFIND section to make restriction against\ndangling bindings more explicit.  Might want to forward reference this\nfrom the last paragraph of section 4.\n\nNext meeting is two weeks from today.\n\n*** End of teleconference ***", "encoding": "ascii"}
