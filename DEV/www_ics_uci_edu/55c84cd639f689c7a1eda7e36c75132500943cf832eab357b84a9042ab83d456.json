Which pairs of cities should you expect to be connected by roads?  The exact answer depends on the details of history,\nbut you can make a guess based on the facts that people will tend to travel between every pair of cities, and don't tend to go too far out of their way.\nSo if the shortest route from city x to city y passes near some other city\nz, people will likely stop there, but otherwise they are likely to go directly\nfrom x to y.  In other words, we can model the likely set of roads by\nsomething like a beta-skeleton.  Obviously this idea would be useful\nin designing new networks as well as in predicting the patterns of old ones.\n\n<P>\nSo how good a road network do you get if you use the beta-skeleton?\n\n<P><CENTER>\n<IMG src=\"betadil.gif\" WIDTH=239 HEIGHT=185 ALT=\"Fractal Beta-Skeleton\">\n</CENTER>\n\n<P>\nNot very good at all!\n\n<P>\nThe fractal curve depicted above defines sets of points\nfor which the beta-skeleton is just the curve itself.\nIn other words, the road network consists of a single\nroad with cities strung out along it, much like Highway 99\nin central California.  But unlike Highway 99, the road is not very straight.\nIf there are <I>n</I> cities, the length of the curve\n(relative to the distance between its endpoints) is\nproportional to a power of <I>n</I> determined by the\ncurve's <I>fractal dimension</I>.\nThe figure above works for some particular values of beta,\nbut by making the fractal flatter we can perform a similar construction\nfor arbitrarily small beta.\n<P>\nSo the <I>dilation</I> of this network,\na factor relating distance in the network and Euclidean distance,\nis non-constant.\nIn terms of the original road network problem, if you use a\nbeta-skeleton road network, you can be forced to travel many times\nfurther than the true distance \"as the crow flies\".\n\n<P>\n[From \"<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/pubs/p-beta.html\">Beta-Skeletons Have\nUnbounded Dilation</A>\".
