Then\ncomes the process of digestion and correction, followed by an\nintricate process of typesetting, printing, and distribution.  To\nconsider the first stage of the procedure, will the author of the\nfuture cease writing by hand or typewriter and talk directly to the\nrecord?  He does so indirectly, by talking to a stenographer or a wax\ncylinder; but the elements are all present if he wishes to have his\ntalk directly produce a typed record.  All he needs to do us to take\nadvantage of existing mechanisms and to alter his language.\n\n<p>\n\nAt a recent World Fair a machine called a Voder was shown.  A girl\nstroked its keys and it emitted recognizable speech.  No human vocal\ncords entered in the procedure at any point; the keys simply combined\nsome electrically produced vibrations and passed these on to a\nloud-speaker.  In the Bell Laboratories there is the converse of this\nmachine, called a Vocoder.  The loudspeaker is replaced by a\nmicrophone, which picks up sound.  Speak to it, and the corresponding\nkeys move.  This may be one element of the postulated system.\n\n<p>\n\nThe other element is found in the stenotype, that somewhat\ndisconcerting device encountered usually at public meetings.  A girl\nstrokes its keys languidly and looks about the room and sometimes at\nthe speaker with a disquieting gaze.  From it emerges a typed strip\nwhich records in a phonetically simplified language a record of what\nthe speaker is supposed to have said.  Later this strip is retyped\ninto ordinary language, for in its nascent form it is intelligible\nonly to the initiated.  Combine these two elements, let the Vocoder\nrun the stenotype, and the result is a machine which types when talked\nto.\n\n<p>\n\nOur present languages are not especially adapted to this sort of\nmechanization, it is true.  It is strange that the inventors of\nuniversal languages have not seized upon the idea of producing one\nwhich better fitted the technique for transmitting and recording\nspeech.  Mechanization may yet force the issue, especially in the\nscientific field; whereupon scientific jargon would become still less\nintelligible to the layman.\n\n<p>\n\nOne can now picture a future investigator in his laboratory.  His\nhands are free, and he is not anchored.  As he moves about and\nobserves, he photographs and comments.  Time is automatically recorded\nto tie the two records together.  If he goes into the field, he may be\nconnected by radio to his recorder.  As he ponders over his notes in\nthe evening, he again talks his comments into the record.  His typed\nrecord, as well as his photographs, may both be in miniature, so that\nhe projects them for examination.\n\n<p>\n\nMuch needs to occur, however, between the collection of data and\nobservations, the extraction of parallel material from the existing\nrecord, and the final insertion of new material into the general body\nof the common record.  For mature thought there is no mechanical\nsubstitute.  But creative thought and essentially repetitive thought\nare very different things.  For the latter there are, and may be,\npowerful mechanical aids.\n\n<p>\n\nAdding a column of figures is a repetitive thought process, and it was\nlong ago properly relegated to the machine.  True, the machine is\nsometimes controlled by the keyboard, and thought of a sort enters in\nreading the figures and poking the corresponding keys, but even this\nis avoidable.  Machines have been made which will read typed figures\nby photocells and then depress the corresponding keys; these are\ncombinations of photocells for scanning the type, electric circuits\nfor sorting the consequent variations, and relay circuits for\ninterpreting the result into the action of solenoids to pull the keys\ndown.\n\n<p>\n\nAll this complication is needed because of the clumsy way in which we\nhave learned to write figures.  If we recorded them positionally,\nsimply by the configuration of a set of dots on a card, the automatic\nreading mechanism would become comparatively simple.  In fact, if the\ndots are holes, we have the punched-card machine long ago produced by\nHollorith for the purposes of the census, and now used throughout\nbusiness.  Some types of complex businesses could hardly operate\nwithout these machines.\n\n<p>\n\nAdding is only one operation.  To perform arithmetical computation\ninvolves also subtraction, multiplication, and division, and in\naddition some method for temporary storage of results, removal from\nstorage for further manipulation, and recording of final results by\nprinting.  Machines for these purposes are now of two types: keyboard\nmachines for accounting and the like, manually controlled for the\ninsertion of data, and usually automatically controlled as far as the\nsequence of operations is concerned; and punched-card machines in\nwhich separate operations are usually delegated to a series of\nmachines, and the cards then transferred bodily from one to another.\nBoth forms are very useful; but as far as complex computations are\nconcerned, both are still embryo.\n\n<p>\n\nRapid electrical counting appeared soon after the physicists found it\ndesirable to count cosmic rays.  For their own purposes the physicists\npromptly constructed thermionic-tube equipment capable of counting\nelectrical impulses at the rate of 100,000 a second.  The advanced\narithmetical machines of the future will be electrical in nature, and\nthey will perform at 100 times present speeds, or more.\n\n<p>\n\nMoreover, they will be far more versatile than present commercial\nmachines, so that they may readily be adapted for a wide variety of\noperations.  They will be controlled by a control card or film, they\nwill select their own data and manipulate it in accordance with the\ninstructions thus inserted, they will perform complex arithmetical\ncomputations at exceedingly high speeds, and they will record results\nin such form as to be readily available for distribution or for later\nfurther manipulation.  Such machines will have enormous appetites.\nOne of them will take instructions and data from a roomful of girls\narmed with simple keyboard punches, and will deliver sheets of\ncomputed results every few minutes.  There will always be plenty of\nthings to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people doing\ncomplicated things.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Next:</b> <a href=\"section4.html\">Section 4</a>,\n<b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"section2.html\">Section 2</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
