If you have to miss lecture for any\r\nreason, please ask one of your classmates to fill you\r\nin on what you missed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are four discussion sections for this class. Each section meets two hours per\r\nweek. This is an important time to get questions answered about homework\r\nproblems. No new content will be given in discussion and we do not take attendance, but you are highly encouraged to\r\nattend as it will give valuable practice on problems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Piazza\">Piazza</a></h3>\r\n<p>\r\nWe will use an online question and answer service called Piazza.\r\nYou will all have an account.\r\nThe link to the to the course page on Piazza is:\r\n<a href=\"https://piazza.com/uci/fall2015/ics6b/home\">\r\n https://piazza.com/uci/fall2015/ics6b/home</a>.\r\nIf you have a question about course content, you can go to see if it\r\nhas already been asked by another students.\r\nIf not, you can post the question yourself.\r\nThe course staff will be checking Piazza several times a day\r\nto update answers to questions posted there.\r\nThere is also a way for students to collectively edit a response\r\nto a question and for instructors to indicate whether the answer\r\nis a good/correct answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiazza is also a good place to post general\r\nadnministrative questions about the class.\r\nIf you send me an email with a technical question about the class,\r\nI am likely to refer you to Piazza.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nImportant class announcements will also be posted on Piazza. You are responsible\r\nfor checking for course announcements at least twice a week.\r\nOnly time ciritical announcements will generate an email.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBefore posting a question on Piazza, you should look through the course\r\nmaterials or previous Piazza posts\r\nto see if you can find the answer to your question.\r\nIf your question is about the technical content of the course,\r\ncheck the text. If you have an administrative question, check the\r\ncourse web page (either the home page with the schedule or this course information page).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiazza provides a way for you to\r\npost anonymously. However, your posts will only be anonymous to other students.\r\nThe instructors will be able to see the name and uciNetID of any individual\r\nwho posts to Piazza.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Assistance\"> Obtaining assistance</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTbe best way to get your questions answered is by coming\r\nto lecture, office hours or discussion and asking them there.\r\nIn particular, office hours and discussion are  the best place to ask questions that\r\nrequire a longer answer or some diaglog to get resolved.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe table below shows where to go to for different kinds\r\nof questions. Please try to follow the directions there.\r\n I really do want to be available for significant problems or issues that may arise.\r\n I also really enjoy meeting students in my office hours.\r\n However, with a class this size, the  amount of email generated from\r\n smaller, routine questions can be overwhelming, so I would like you\r\n to try and find  answers through other sources first.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table border>\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<th>\r\nQuestion type\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nExample\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nWhere to go\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nQuestions about course content\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nWhat's the difference between (x,y) and {x,y}?\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nTry and find the answer to your question through the course materials.<br/>\r\nIf your question is not answered, then <br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://piazza.com\" target=\"_blank\">Post on Piazza</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nGeneral administrative questions\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nWhat topics does test 1 cover?\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nCheck the course web page (schedule and course information) first.<br/>\r\nIf your question is not answered, then <br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://piazza.com\" target=\"_blank\">Post on Piazza</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nQuestions on how your HW or test was graded.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nI don't understand why I didn't get full credit on the first question.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nOffice hours of the reader or TA who graded that HW or test</br>\r\n(readers and TAs will post on Piazza who graded which test.</br>\r\nOffice hours are listed <a href=\"courseinfo.html\">here.</a>)\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nMinor bug in the text.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nShouldn't the last line of this animation be x<sub>2</sub> instead of x<sub>1</sub>?\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nUse the feedback button in the text.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nTechnical problem you are having with the text.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nWhy doesn't the text show 100% progress for Section 1.2? </br>\r\nI think I did all the activities in the section.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\n<a href=\"mailto:support@zyBooks.com\">support@zyBooks.com</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nMajor issue reading the text.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nNone of the mathematical formulas are showing up in Section 1.4.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\n<a href=\"mailto:support@zyBooks.com\">support@zyBooks.com</a></br>\r\nand cc <a href=\"mailto:irani@ics.uci.edu\">irani@ics.uci.edu</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nMistake in HW or HW solutions.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nI think the answer to question 3 on HW 2 should be 56 and not 57.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\n<a href=\"https://piazza.com\" target=\"_blank\">Post on Piazza</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Grading\">Grading</a></h3>\r\n\r\nThe grading criteria for the course is:\r\n<ul>\r\nHomework 5%<br/>\r\nReading Assignments 4%<br/>\r\nTests 60% (15% each)<br>\r\nFinal 30%<br>\r\nCompleting the Course Evaluation 1%<br>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nI am frequently asked whether I curve the grades. The answer to this question will\r\nalways be \"I don't know\".\r\nFirst of all, no letter grades are assigned to scores until I calculate a final course\r\npercentage for each student. I generally do aim to have the A's fall in the 90-100 range\r\nand the B's in the 80-90 range, etc. Sometimes I am a bit more generous that that, depending\r\non the distribution of scores. Occasionally I give a test or final that is harder than I\r\nexpect. In those circumstances, I will sometimes make a problem count as extra credit.\r\nThe best strategy for success is not to think too much about your grade but to continually\r\ndo your best to understand the material in the class.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome time around week 2 or  3, I will start to take attendance in class using a web-based\r\nattendance system. You encouraged to have some kind of internet connected device in class for you\r\nto register your attendance. You do not recieve any credit for attending class and you are not directly\r\npenalized if you do not attend class.\r\nHowever, I do use the population of students who attend regularly (at least 75% of the lectures)\r\nto determine if I need to adjust the grading scale.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Tests\">Tests</a></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere will be four tests given during the quarter. Each of these covers a different set of topics covered\r\nin the course. The final exam will be cumulative and will cover all the material covered during the\r\nentire quarter. The tests will be given in class during the normal scheduled lecture time.\r\nThe dates of the four tests and the final exam are:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Week 3: Mon, October 12</li>\r\n<li>Week 5: Mon, October 26</li>\r\n<li>Week 7: Mon, November 9</li>\r\n<li>Week 9: Mon, Nivember 23</li>\r\n<li>Final exam: Friday, December 11, 1:30PM-3:30PM</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere will be assigned seating for the tests. When you arrive in the classroom, you need to get a test\r\nfrom one of the course staff. Each test is marked with a row and seat number.\r\nYou are required to sit in the seat indicated on your test.\r\nIt is a violation of the academic honesty policy to swap tests with any other student after you have received\r\nyour test or to sit in a seat other than the one designated on your written test.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe only thing you need to have for tests and the final exam is a pen or pencil for writing.\r\nAll scantron forms and/or paper will be provided.\r\nNo electronic devices (including calculators) are allowed in tests or exams.\r\nThere should be no visible screens during a test or exam.\r\nLaptops should be closed and tablets should be in a closed folder or stowed in a bag.\r\nPhones should be stowed in a bag or pocket so that they are not visible at all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nMissed tests or final exam:</p>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> All four tests and the final exam are mandatory. If you miss a test or the final exam and do not have a valid reason, you will receive\r\na score of 0 on the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n<LI>\r\nThere are only two classes of valid reasons for missing a test or the final exam:\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>  An unforeseeable emergency, such as a medical emergency.\r\nIn such cases I will ask for documentation.\r\n<LI> An absence from an exam due to a foreseeable circumstance\r\nthat I have approved in advance.\r\n</OL>\r\n<li>If you miss a test due to a forseeable circumstances, I must receive notification from you a week in advance.\r\nIf the absence is due to an unforseeable emergency, I should receive an email from you as soon as you are able\r\nto send it. In either case, I will ask you to come see me in person to discuss how I will\r\nadapt your grade for the course.\r\n</li>\r\n<LI>\r\nA work conflict or a family vacation is NOT a valid reason for missing a test or the final exam.\r\n<LI> If I accept your reason for missing a test or the final exam, I will assign your grade on the basis\r\nof the remaining course work that you did not miss. There are no make up tests.\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Homework\">Homework</a></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHomework is due every Wednesday, starting in week 2.\r\nThe homework will consist of a written portion and an electronic portion.\r\nThe written portion should be put in the\r\ndropbox labeled \"ICS 6B\" on the first floor of Bren Hall.\r\n You must hand it in before 5:30PM on the day it is due.<strong> Absolutely no late homework assignments will be accepted.\r\n</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe electronic portion consists of the problems labeled <b>Challenge Activity</b>\r\nembedded in the reading.\r\nThese activities are automatically corrected as you do them.\r\nYou can redo these problems as many times as you want with no penalty.\r\nYou will receive full credit on a challenge activity if you eventually complete the activity correctly\r\nby the time it is due.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou will notice that the homework counts very little towards your grade.\r\nIt is important to do the homework because it enables you to learn the material but a missed\r\nhomework will not have a big effect on your grade. Also, I will drop the lowest homework score\r\nin calculating your final grade.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrades for the assignements and tests  will be posted through EEE.\r\nIf you have questions regarding grading, please see the reader or TA who graded that assignment.\r\nThe readers and TAs will be posting on Piazza when test grades and homework scores are ready so you will\r\nknow who graded which assignments.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI will post solutions to the homework so that you can use them to study for the tests.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Text\">Text</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe test for this class is a web-based interactive, animated offering as your \"textbook\".\r\nYou are required to have an account for the course. The material\r\nincludes interactive\r\nexercises which will count towards your grade.\r\nThe directions for subscribing can be found at:\r\n<ol><li> Go to <a href=\"https://zybooks.zyante.com/#/zybooks\">https://zybooks.zyante.com/#/zybooks</a>.\r\nBookmark this site - this is your site for the entire quarter.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nYou will need a\r\ncredit card or Paypal account to pay the subscription price of $40.\r\nContact <a href=\"mailto:support@zyBooks.com\">\r\nsupport@zyBooks.com</a> for help or with any questions regarding obtaining a subscription.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYour reading for this class is associated with your subscription for the Fall 2015 offering of\r\nICS 6B, so  you will need a new subscription even if you have had a previous subscription\r\nto the Discrete Math zyBook for some other class.\r\nHowever, if your subscription to the Discrete Math zyBook occurred in the last year (or currently\r\nfor another class), you will be automatically given  a 50% discount.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you drop the class in the first two weeks, you can contact support@zyBooks.com to get\r\na full refund for the text.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"ReadingCredit\">Credit for reading</a></h3>\r\n<p>\r\nEach reading assignment (except for the first two weeks) is due at 2PM the day it is assigned.\r\nThe reading for the first and second weeks is due at 2PM Monday Oct 12.\r\nEvery action through your zyBook is automatically timestamped.\r\nWhen I compile grades for reading, I determine how much\r\nof your  reading was completed by a particular day and time,\r\nso the deadlines are automatically enforced.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou are required to complete all the activities labeled <b>Participation Activity</b>\r\nby the time the reading is due. The problems labeled <b>Challenge activity</b>\r\nare part of the homework and are due later than the reading.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou can determine how much of the reading has been completed\r\nby looking at your zyBook dashboard.\r\nPlease familiarize yourself with this interface and make sure\r\nthat you have 100% completion by 2PM for the sections assigned each\r\nlecture day.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"BoardNotes\">Board notes</a></h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter lecture, I will post the board notes generated during lecture.\r\nThe purpose of posting the notes is to the reduce the amount of\r\nnote taking you need to be doing in class. The best way to learn this material\r\nis to attend class and concentrate on what is being said.\r\nHaving the board notes provided means that you can spend more time\r\nthinking about the content of the lectures and less time copying down\r\nwhat is being written.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe board notes are not intended to be a perfectly readable\r\ntranscript for everyting that took place in class.\r\nYou will still  have to take some additional notes\r\nbased on the discussion in class.\r\nThe board notes are definitely not a substitute for attending class.\r\nThey merely serve to reduce the amount of writing you need to\r\ndo while you are in class.\r\nIf you are sitting in lecture and you can not read something I have\r\nwritten, please raise your hand and ask for clarification.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you are unable to attend class for some reason, you should not\r\nexpect the board notes to be sufficient to decipher the material I covered.\r\nYou need to contact a fellow classmate to get his or her\r\nnotes and possibly follow up in discussion with questions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h3><a name=\"AcademicHonesty\">Academic Honesty</a></h3>\r\n    <p>The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established an academic honesty policy. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">Read it.</a></p>\r\n    <p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n    <h4>Guidelines to avoid plagarism:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>Do not look at another person's homework.</b>\r\n      Instead you should prefer to discuss the problem in plain English.\r\n      This helps you to communicate clearly, practice technical jargon as it applies to your problem, and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior different from what you expect.\r\n      <li><b>Do not write down the solution in your notes.</b>\r\n      It is perfectly fine (and encouraged) to collborate on work.\r\n      Working in a group is a rewarding experience, and definitely a necessary skill in any professional career.\r\n      The collaboration can include drawing diagrams and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard.\r\n      However, you should avoid writing the solution in your notes.\r\n      It is very useful to rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you solve it again on your own.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>We expect that:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among yourselves.</b> Making sure that others follow these guidelines will help to ensure that they don't pass off your work as their own.</p>\r\n      <li><b>Your work honestly represents your efforts.</b> The entire purpose of obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of skills and experience that will help you later on. If you do not perform the work yourself, then you have cheated yourself out of the education. Employers in our field can (and do) screen applicants for skills and knowledge. You will perform poorly (and discredit UCI) if you do not practice now by doing your own work.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
