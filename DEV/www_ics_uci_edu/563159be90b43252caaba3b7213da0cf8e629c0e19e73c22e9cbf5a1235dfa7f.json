If you don't want =\n\nthe text in italics, simply remove the 'em' command and =\n\nthe curly braces which bound the abstract text.  If you =\n\nhave em commands within an italicized abstract, the text =\n\nwill come out as normal (non-italicized) text. =\n\n%end italics mode\n}\n\\section{Introduction}\nHere is my introduction text.  There are 2 blank lines =\n\nbefore the section heading and one afterwards.  Heading =\n\ntext is 12 point bold font.  Paragraphs are not indented. =\n\nI may want a numbered subsection, which is done as =\n\nfollows.\n\\subsection{Previous Work}\nIn subsections there is 1 blank line before the section =\n\nheading and one afterwards.  Heading text is 11 point =\n\nbold font.  Paragraphs are indented one pica.  There is =\n\nno blank line between paragraphs.\nThroughout I may cite references of the form =\n\n\\cite{key:foo} or \\cite{foo:baz}, and LaTeX will keep =\n\ntrack of numbering.  The numbers are based on the order =\n\nyou place them in the bibliography, not the order they =\n\nappear in the text.  They should (I believe) be in =\n\nalphabetical order.  LaTex will put square brackets about =\n\nthe number within the text of your paper.  For those of =\n\nyou new to the bibliography package, you may have to run =\n\nthe latex process twice to allow all references to be =\n\nresolved. You will get a warning about a missing .aux =\n\nfile.  Just rerun latex and it will be ok.\n\\section{Summary and Conclusions}\nThis template will get you through the minimum article, =\n\ni.e. no figures or equations.  To include those, please =\n\nrefer to your LaTeX manual and the IEEE publications =\n\nguidelines.  Good Luck!\n%this is how to do an unnumbered subsection\n\\subsection*{Acknowledgments}\nThis is how to do an unnumbered subsection, which comes =\n\nout in 11 point bold font.  Here I thank my colleagues, =\n\nespecially Mike Gennert, who know more about Tex and =\n\nLatex than I.\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\n\\bibitem{key:foo}\nI. M.
