WebRTC also provides data sharing.\n<br> \n<br> \nWe are investigating issues in WebRTC behavior and performance.  To this end we have developed a benchmark suite, WebRTCBench.  The goal of WebRTCBench is to provide a quantitative comparison of WebRTC implementations across browsers and devices (i.e., hardware platforms).  WebRTC accomplishes three main tasks: Acquiring audio and video; Communicating Audio and Video; Communicating Arbitrary Data. These tasks are mapped one to one to three main Javascript APIs. These are as follows: MeadiaStream (i.e., getUserMedia); RTCPeerConnection; RTCDataChannel. Hence, a quantitative assessment of WebRTC implementations across browser and devices is performed via collecting performance of MediaStream, RTCPeerConnection, and RTCDataChannel.  Because a MediaStream contains one or more media stream tracks (e.g., Webcam and Microphone), WebRTCBenc allows to define MediaStreams composed of Video, Audio, Data and any combination thereof. Likewise single peer connection with media server and multiple peer connections between browsers are supported in a WebRTC triangle.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe current version of the benchmark can be found\n<A HREF=\"https://github.com/INTCUCI/WebRTCBench\">here</A>\n<br>\n<br>\nSupported by the Intel Corp.\n</dir>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
