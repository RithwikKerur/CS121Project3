Rosa maiden name was Rosa Loise\nMcCauley. She was born in Tuskegee, Alabama on February 4, 1913.</p> <p>\nGrowing up Rosa went through a lot of trials and tribulations.  Her father\nmoved out on her when she was two years old and left her, her mother\nLeona, and her brother Sylvester to move in with her grandparents.  Her\ngrandparents and her mother were all in bad health so Rosa took over the\nmotherly chores such as the cooking, cleaning, shopping, and sewing.  At\nage 11 Rosa went to live with her aunt in Montgomery, where she enrolled\nin the Montgomery Industrial School for Girls. They didn't have enough\nmoney to pay for tuition so Rosa cleaned the classrooms after school to\ncompensate for the inadequate funds.</p> <p> In 1943 Rosa joined the NAACP\nwhere she helped register black voters. She was always into the upbringing\nof African-Americans because she encouraged other blacks to get involved\nin the Civil Rights Movement and this was quite evident from what happened\nto her in 1955 on a Montgomery bus.  She was riding on the bus when it\ncame to a stop and a white man came on the bus. While sitting in her seat\nand minding her on business, the white man tells her to get out of her\nseat and move to the back of the bus.  Rosa said \"No\" of course but it\ndidn't stop there. The bus driver also told her to get out of her seat but\nshe still didn't move and the bus driver threatned to call the authorities,\nbut nothing changed.  The police later came and arrested Rosa. She had to\ngo to court and she eventually paid $14 to be let go on trial. Rosa got\ntogether a black congregation and they started to boycott against the\nMontgomery buses.  The boycott lasted for 361 days and the buses were\neventually desegrgated.<a \nhref=\"http://www.ccnet.com/products/calmoore/rosa.htm\"><i>Rosa Parks</i> \n\n\n\n</p> <p>  \nA man\nby the name of <b>Martin Luther King, Jr</b>. who was also a civil rights\nparticipant during this era. Martin Luther King Jr, was running a campaign\nof peace in instances such as this. He wanted us to conduct our struggle on\nthe highest plane of dignity and discipline. He didn't want us to meet\nphysical force with physical force but with soul force. His belief was\nthat two wrongs don't make a right and we as black people in a white world\nhad to be above the rest.</p> <p> In 1963 Martin Luther King gave his\nfamous <i>\"I Have A Dream\"</i> speech from the steps of the Lincoln\nMemorial. This speech was very inspirational and it gave black people hope\nfor good things to come. In this speech he made analogies of\nAfrican-Americans getting written a bad check. \"America has given the\nNegro people a bad check--- a check which has come back marked\n\"insufficient funds.\" But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is\nbankrupt.\" This is a very intriguing statement. He is saying that America\nhas no hope and faith in black people, but we keep trying to prove them\nwrong. Some people might say that we were stupid for trying to prove them\nwrong but thought all of these mishaps we kept trying to move forward.\nWhile taking a class at UCI titled \"The Psychology of a Black Man\", the\nprofessor Thomas Parham once said to me that\"African-American people\nbelieve in collective survival.\"  At first I couldn't understand what that\nmeant but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. He was\nsaying that as a nationality we are not selfish people. We don't believe in\none person so call\"making it.\"  If we make it, we make it together as a\nnation. He wants to \"lift our nation from the quicksands of racial\ninjustice to solid rock of brotherhood.\"<a \nhref=\"http://www.ai.mit.edu/~isbell/HFh/black/bhcal-toc.html\"><I>KING</i> \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>Thurgood Marshall</b> (1908-1993) is probably most noted for his \nwork in \nthe civil rights movement.  He was the first African American to serve on \nthe supreme court.  Marshall served on the supreme court bench for 24 years \nand would have continued if his health would have permitted.</p>\n<p>Before Marshall was appointed to the Supreme Court he worked hard in \nthe legal field as an attorney and led a very interesting life.  In the \nyear 1930 Marshall graduated from Lincoln University (Cum Laude) and \nthree years later in 1933,  he earned his law degree from Harvard \nUniversity.  From  1940 to 1961 Marshall served as legal director for \nthee NAACP,  along side Charles Hamilton (the first African American to \nwin a case before the Supreme Court) designed long term goals to end the \ninjustice of segregation in America.  Marshall gained world wide \nattention and fame by arguing and winning the landmark court case of \nBrown v. Board of Education.  The outcome of this particular case was it \nmade the segregation of schools in America illegal.</p>\n<p>The road to the Supreme Court Justice seat was a long and bumpy one to \nsay the least.  At the time he was nominated America was still a blatant \nracist country and the black man was looked down upon.  Nominated by \nLyndon Johnson in 1967, it took a lot of time to get the nomination push \nthrough.  \nBefore finally succeding Tom Clark,  Marshall had already argued 32 cases \nand winning 29 of them.</p>\n<p>Thurgood Marshall was and still is an exceptional man.  He got into \nthe system to overcome the system.  He worked for African Americans all \nthe way until his recent death on Jan 24, 1993.  Thurgood Marshall can \ntruly be said to be one of the many forefathers of the civil rights \nmovement.</p>\n<p><i>\"Equal means getting the same thing, at the same time, at in  same \nplace.\"</p></i>\n<a \nhref=\"http://www.ai.mit.edu/~isbell/HFh/black/events_and_people/html/001.thurgood_marshall.html\"><i>Thurgood Marshall</i> \n\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>George Washington Carver</b> (1864-1943) was born a slave in \nMississippi.  Carver earned his high school Diploma after the Civil War \nworking as a farm hand.  He put his way through Iowa Agriculture college \nby assuming the duties of the school janitor.  Shortly after graduating \nfrom Iowa Agriculturer college,  Carver received his Masters degree from \nthe same institution.  With all of his work being monitored he was \nquickly given a position on the faculty.  After a brief stint at Iowa, \nCarver left to join Booker T. Washington at Tuskegee Institute.</p>\n\n<P>Carver was and is still world renowed for his achievements in the \nfield of agriculture.  He taught sharecroppers and farmers how to grow, \npreserve and maximize their yield in rotating crops.  In 1914 Carver \ninfluenced southern congressman to move to other crops besides cotton \ncrops that were being threatned by the  \"boll weevil\" thus \nrevolutionized southern agriculture.  Carver developed processes for \nmanufacturing  paper, ink, shaving cream, lindeum, syntheic rubber, \nplastics, bleach, metal polish and over 300 consumer and industrial \nproducts from the peanut and sweet potato. In the following you will have \nthe opportunity to view a partial list of some of the inventions by some \nof the African Americans.</p>\n\n<i>click </i><a \nhref=\"http://www.ai.mit.edu/~isbell/HFh/black/events_and_people/009.aa_inventions\"></b>to jump to inventions.\n\n<p>Carver was sought throughout the world.  Carver was sought out by \npeople from Joseph Stalin to Mahatma Ghandi.  Stalin sought Carvers \nopinion to help exploit the fertility of the huge mass of the former \nUSSR.  Stalin wanted to maximize the full output of the area and Carver \nhad that sort of knowledge to maximize the areas potential output.  \nGhandi asked Carver to help build and maintain his countries agricutural \nsystem.  In a effort to contribute to Africas need, Carver developed a \npeanut milk. The peanut milk is a nutricious alternative to the \ntraditional cow's milk. By developing an alternative to cow's milk, \nCarver helped save the lives of hundred of babies in west Africa.</p>\n\n<P>It is interesting that while at Tuskegee,  Carver never took out a \npatent on any of his inventions.  Carver was offered huge salaries to \nwork for Thomas Edison and Henry Ford but choose instead to work for \nthe improvement of the quality of life for the disinfranchished.  Carver \nwas a self-less person and only wanted the people to better off.</p>\n\n<p><I>\"God gave them to me; how can I sell them to someone else?

Cauffee \nwas an intense man that advocated getting free slaves back to Africa \nand helping them settle down.  Cauffee was a smuggler of people back to \ntheir native land.  Cauffe intended to make one trip per year at his own \nexpense, taking the freed slaves to Africa and returning with cargo.  \nHe took thirty eight freed slaves  to Freetown, Sierra Leone, but due \nto his untimely death in 1817 the freedom missions ceased.</p>\n\n<P>Cauffee was also a good business man; you might even say he was a \nphilanthropist. With the freedom missions came great expense, and Cauffee \ndid pay for everything himself.  What he did not pay for himself British \ncontributed.  With the British involvement he felt by them helping they \nwere contributing to the regeneration of Africa.  Cauffees' greatest \naccomplishment might have been gaining the right for African Americans to \nvote in the state of Massachuttes in 1783.</p>\n<a \nhref=\"http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/African.American/acsbegin.html\"><i> \nlegacy </i>\n      \n\n <p>These are just some of the brilliant African Americans who have made \ncontributions to not only  American society but to the world.
