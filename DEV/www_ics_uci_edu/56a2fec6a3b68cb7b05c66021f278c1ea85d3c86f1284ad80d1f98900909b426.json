Larsen</h2>\n\n<p>Abstract:</p>\nMost of us have an intuitive understanding of what a greedy-like algorithm\nis. Even though the concept has been studied in restricted scenarios, such\nas matroid theory, the concept, as it is used as an every-day algorithms\nor programming paradigm, has not been formally studied. Priority\nAlgorithms is an attempt at modeling and capturing the power of these\ngreedy-like algorithmic approaches to problem solving. Most of the work in\nthe area has been targeted at establishing lower bounds on the ratios\nobtainable when approximating NP-hard problems using greedy-like\napproaches. We give a brief introduction to the topic. In the talk, we\ndefine priority algorithms, list problem scenarios that have been\ninvestigated so far, and discuss a few examples to give the flavor of the\nkind of argumentation which is used.\n<p>\nThis is joint work with Allan Borodin and Joan Boyar.\n<h1><a name=\"George\">On the Convergence of Upper Bound Techniques\n           for the Average Length of Longest Common Subsequences</a></h1>\n<h2>George Lueker</h2>\n<p>Abstract:</p>\nThis talk will describe some methods for finding upper bounds on the\nexpected length of two random strings of equal length, and investigate\nwhether these methods produce bounds that are asymptotic to the true value.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
