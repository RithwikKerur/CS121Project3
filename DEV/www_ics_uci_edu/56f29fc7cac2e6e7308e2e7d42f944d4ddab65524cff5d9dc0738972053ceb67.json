The figures I am interested in, with cartesian\n&gt;    descriptions, are:\n\n&gt;    rectangle (r)\t\t[0, a] X [0, b]\n&gt;    halfstrip (hs)\t\tR+ X [0, b]\n&gt;    strip (s)\t\t\tR X [0, b]\n&gt;    angled strip (as)\t\t([0, a] X R+) U (R+ X [0, b])\n&gt;    quadrant (q)\t\tR+ X R+\n&gt;    halfplane (hp)\t\tR X R+\n&gt;    three-quarter plane (tp)\t(tp)(R X R+) U (R+ X R)\n&gt;    plane (p)\t\t\tR X R\n\nyou should read the following article:\n\n solomon golomb, tiling with polyominoes, journal of combinatorial\n    theory, volume 1, (1966), pages 280-296.\n\nhe considers all the above possibilities (except for the three-quarter\nplane), as well as the possibility that the polyomino tiles a larger\ncopy of itself.  from his examples, it's clear that he allows the use\nof mirror images; however, the implications do not change under this\ninterpretation.  here's the diagram of implications he gives:\n\n                            rectangle\n\n                          /     |\n                         /      |\n                        /       v\n                       /\n                      /     half strip\n                     /\n                    /           |\n                   /            |\n                  /             v\n                 /\n               \\/_          bent strip\n\n            itself              |\n                                |\n              \\                 v\n               \\\n                \\           quadrant &amp; strip\n                 \\\n                  \\        /              \\\n                   \\      /                \\\n                   _\\/  \\/_                _\\/\n\n                   quadrant                 strip\n                 \n                          \\               /\n                           \\             /\n                           _\\/         \\/_\n\n                              half plane\n\n                                  |\n                                  |\n                                  v\n\n                                plane\n\n                                  |\n                                  |\n                                  v\n\n                               nothing\n\nmost of the implications are immediate (e.g. quadrant ==&gt; half plane,\nsince the half plane may be tiled with two quadrants).  the only\nnon-obvious implications are:     itself ==&gt; quadrant,  and\n                              bent strip ==&gt; (quadrant &amp;) strip.\ni will leave these to the reader to prove.\n\nif we add the \"three-quarter plane\" we have the implications:\n\n          quadrant  ==&gt;  three-quarter plane  ==&gt;  plane\n\nthe first implication is immediate, but i need the axiom of choice\nto deduce the second.  (if anyone can prove the second without the\naxiom of choice, please let me and sci.math know.)  as a hint,\ntry to prove that if a polyomino can cover an N-by-N square for all N\n(no overlap, and pieces may hang over the edges of the square), then\nit tiles the plane.  i don't know if the implication \n\n              three-quarter plane  ==??==&gt;  half plane \n\nis valid, but there are a number of potential implications that\nhaven't yet been ruled out, even though there's no apparent reason\nthey should hold.  (e.g.  itself  ==??==&gt; rectangle)\n\n[many lines deleted for brevity]\n\n&gt;    I have been unable to find polyominoes in sets other than these\n&gt;    five, or to fill in the ? in the above table.  There may be general\n\ngolomb classifies all (except the infamous y hexomino) polyominoes of\norder <U>&lt;</U> 6, and finds that many of these sets are unrepresented.\n\n&gt;    implications I have not worked out (e.g., does a polyomino tiling\n&gt;    the half strip necessarily tile a rectangle?).  It would make an\n&gt;    interesting study.\n\nindeed.\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:umatf071@unibi.hrz.uni-bielefeld.de\">umatf071@unibi.hrz.uni-bielefeld.de</A> (0105)\n<B>Subject:</B>        prime boxes of the Y-pentomino\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 20 Nov 92 19:25:50 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   Universitaet Bielefeld\n<B>Keywords:</B>       tiling\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n                                      Torsten Sillke, Bielefeld\nList of all prime rectangles and boxes for the Y-pentomino (.:..).\nA 'p' following a number indecates a prime box.\n\nRectangles with the Y-pentomino:\n\n10: 5p, 10, 14p, 15, 16p, 19, 20, 21, 23p, 24, 25, 26, 27p, 24-27 + 5*n\n15: 10, 14p, 15p, 16p, 17p, 19p, 20, 21p, 22p, 23p, 24-33 + 10*n\n20: 5, 9p, 10, 11p, 13p, 14, 15, 16, 17p, 14-17 + 5*n\n25: 10, 14, 15, 16, 17p, 18p, 19, 20, 21, 22p, 23p, 24, 25, 26, 27\n30: 5, 9p, 10, 11p, 13p, 14, 15, 16, 17, 14-17 + 5*n\n35: 10, 11p, 13p, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18p, 19, 20, 21, 22, ...\n40: 5, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 13-16 + 5*n\n45: 9p, 10, 11p, 13p, 14, 15, 16, ...\n50: 5, 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 9-13 + 5*n\n55: 9p, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n60: 5, 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n65: 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n70: 5, 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n75: 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n80: 5, 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n85: 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n90: 5, 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n95: 9, 10, 11, 12p, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...\n100: 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, ...  /no new prime\n/all primes found\n\nStrips (one side open) with the Y-pentomino:\n 5p, 6p, 8p, 9p, 10, 11, 12, 8-12 + 5n\n \nStrips (two sides open) with the Y-pentomino:\n 2p, 4, 5p, 4-5 + 2n\n\nBoxes with the Y-pentomino:\n2 5: 6p, 8p, 10, 11p, 12, 13p, 14, 15p, 10-15 + 6n\n3 5: 4p, 8, 9p, 10, 11p, 8-11 + 4n\n4 5: 3p, 4p, 5p, 3-5 + 3n\n5 5: 4p, 5p, 6p, 7p, 4-7 + 4n\n6 5: 2p, 4, 5p, 4-5 + 2n\n7 5: 4, 5p, 6, 7p, 4-7 + 4n\n8 5: 2p, 3, 2-3 + 2n\n9 5: 3p, 4, 5, 3-5 + 3n\nk 5: 2, 3, 2-3 + 2n  (k<U>&gt;</U>10) see 2 5: k, and 3 5: k\n\n2 10: 4p, 5, 6, 7p, ...\n3 10: 4, 5, 6p, 7p, ...\n\n2 15: 4p, 5p, 6, 7p, ...\n3 15: 4, 5, 6p, 7p, ...\n/all primes found\n\nImpossible hyperboxes with the Y-pentomino:\n 2*..*2*3*..*3*n (and strip on side open)\n 2*..*2*3*..*3*5*5\n\nWhen did I get the results:\nNew (August 1992)\n10*23, 10*27, 15*17, 15*19, 15*21, 20*13, 20*17\n    (September 1992)\n30*11, 30*13, 25*17, 35*11, 45*11, 45*9, 55*9, 35*13, 45*13\n    (October 1992)\n15*23, 18*25, 18*35, 3*5*9, 3*5*11, 5*5*6, 5*5*7, 5*7*7, 2*7*10, 3*6*10, 2*7*15\n    (November 1992)\n3*7*10, 3*7*15\n\nAnnotations:\n  15*15  16 solutions without H-symmetry\n  20*13   1 solution  without H-symmetry\n\nQuestion:\n=========\n-- What are the prime rectangles for the one-sided \nY-pentomino (.:..), L-pentomino (:...), and P-pentomino (::.)?\nThe case of the L-tetromino is solved.\nKnown prime rectangles:\n  Y-pentomino: 5*10\n  L-pentomino: 2*5\n  P-pentomino: 2*5\n\n-- Why is there no 8*5n rectangle tileable with Y-pentominoes?\n\n-- Where are the prime hyperboxes?\n-- Is there anyone interested?\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
