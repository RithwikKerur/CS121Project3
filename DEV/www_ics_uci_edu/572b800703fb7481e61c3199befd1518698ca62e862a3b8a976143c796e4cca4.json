You may audio tape lecture, provided only you, yourself, use it and only to study for this course.</p></li>\n \n<li><p><i>Keep up with the reading;</i> you&#146;ll need the information it provides to do your assignments and exams, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed pages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#146;re not careful. But don&#146;t try to memorize everything the first time you read it through. A good strategy is to read for the broad ideas before lecture, listen to lecture carefully, and then refer back to the text for reference as needed.</li>\n\n<li><p><i>Start  working with your partner on the lab assignments early on; computer work always takes longer to complete than you think it will,</i> even if you have previous experience. All lab assignments are in the Lab Manual; to keep from getting behind, start each no later than the date given for it in the Course Schedule.</li>\n\n<li><p><i>Let us know if one of your scores is wrong or missing.</i> If you do not see your score for an assignment, exam or evaluation you turned in when we post its scores, contact me; I'll work with you to determine what has happened. Often, a missing score means you did not turn in your work properly. If we can find the item, we'll score it; if we cannot, you'll need to contact me to determine what can be done.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<h3>Announcements</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>During the quarter, important  announcements will be made in lecture; those of particular importance will also be posted to the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/Announcements.html\">Announcements Board</a>; check it often! </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<a name=\"#Java\"></a>\n<h3>Setting Up Java at Home</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Some students like to do their Java programming outside of the Help Center. That&#146;s fine, as long as it is in addition to&#151;not instead of&#151;working with your partner in the Help Center; as discussed in the Course Reference and Lab Manual, <i>pair programming is a required part of this course</i>. For guidance on installing Java on a home computer, see  the primer <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/SettingUpJava.html\">Setting Up Java at Home</a>. Note that we do not have the resources to support your home installation; you&#146;re on your own for working out problems or difficulties you encounter (except that, during my office hours, I&#146;ll help you as I can with these issues, provided no one is waiting to discuss course-related matters).</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<h3>Sample Exam Questions</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>A set of questions in the form of the midterm and final exams, called <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/SampleExamQuestions.pdf\"> Sample Exam Questions,</a> is available to provide you some guidance on what to expect on this term&#146;s midterm and final. Do note, though, that these tests may contain questions on topics that will not be on the exam you take, and there may well be questions on your exams covering topics not on these tests.
