More recently,\nthis algorithm has been analysed in terms of comparisons and swaps by\nWild and Nebel. Our contributions to the topic are as follows. First, we\nperform the previous experiments using a native C implementation thus\nremoving potential extraneous effects of the JVM. Second, we provide\nanalyses on cache behavior of these algorithms. We then provide strong\nevidence that cache behavior is causing most of the performance\ndifferences in these algorithms. Additionally, we build upon prior work\nin multi-pivot quicksort and propose a 3-pivot variant that performs\nvery well in theory and practice. We show that it makes fewer\ncomparisons and has better cache behavior than the dual pivot quicksort\nin the expected case. We validate this with experimental results,\nshowing a 7&ndash;8% performance improvement in our tests.\n</p>\n<p>(Based\non <a href=\"http://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1.9781611973198.6\">a\npaper from ALENEX 2014</a>\nby Shrinu Kushagra, Alejandro L&oacute;pez-Ortiz, J.
