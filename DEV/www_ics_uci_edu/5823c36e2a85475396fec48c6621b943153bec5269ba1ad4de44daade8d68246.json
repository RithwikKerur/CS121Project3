This talk will deal with one\nsuch issue, namely the limited amount of power in a battery powered node\nin the network. Traditional routing algorithms may drain a crucial node\nin the network that might have several debilitating effects on the\nnetwork at large. Several system level researchers have started studying\nthis problem producing interesting results, both empirically and\ntheoretically. This talk will be a survey of these results.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
