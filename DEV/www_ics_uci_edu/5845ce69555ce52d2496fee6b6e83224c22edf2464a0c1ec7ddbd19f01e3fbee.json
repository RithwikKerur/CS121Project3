McConnell, K. Mehlhorn, S. Naher, and P. Schweitzer </h2>\n\n<p>\nAbstract:\nA certifying algorithm is an algorithm that produces, with each output, a certificate or witness\n(easy-to-verify proof) that the particular output has not been compromised by a bug. A user of a\ncertifying algorithm inputs x, receives the output y and the certificate w, and then checks, either\nmanually or by use of a program, that w proves that y is a correct output for input x. In this way,\nhe/she can be sure of the correctness of the output without having to trust the algorithm.\nWe put forward the thesis that certifying algorithms are much superior to non-certifying algorithms,\nand that for complex algorithmic tasks, only certifying algorithms are satisfactory.\nAcceptance of this thesis would lead to a change of how algorithms are taught and how algorithms\nare researched. The widespread use of certifying algorithms would greatly enhance the\nreliability of algorithmic software.\nWe survey the state of the art in certifying algorithms and add to it. In particular, we start a\ntheory of certifying algorithms and prove that the concept is universal.\n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
