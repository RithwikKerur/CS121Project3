I don't have a proof that it loses for all a &gt; 2, but it\n   does lose sometimes; e.g. for a = 3.\n\n    In  3x3x3, the reply to  (1,1,1)  is  (2,2,0).  Matters become clear\n   by noting the position \"pyramid OABC\", OA = i, OB = j, OC = k, containing\n   ten points. (The rest have been taken).  It has Nim value 0, i.e. the\n   player about to move from it loses.  The faces relate to value-0 positions\n   in two dimensions, \"equal axes\" and \"chomped-corner 2 x m\".\n\n    Briefly, II uses symmetry to lead I into OABC.  If I takes (0,1,2),\n   II takes (1,0,2), and so on.  (Adding to OABC six adjacent edge midpoints\n   yields another value-0 position).  Of course she might elect to lose in some\n   other way rather than by \"tempo\" play near A, B, C.\n\n    To win, I  plays  (2,2,2)  on the first move.  The anthropomorphic\n   view is similar to the one above.\n\n    On 2x2x2, (1,1,1) does win... but maybe not by virtue of being (1,1,1)\n   but of being the cube corner!\n\n                            Ilias\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           David Eppstein &lt;<a href= \n\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;\n<b>To:</b>             <a href=\n\"mailto:jeffe@cs.uiuc.edu\">jeffe@cs.uiuc.edu</a>\n<b>Subject:</b>        Mancala-like CGT question\n<b>Date:</b>           Sat, 10 Apr 1999 21:59:31 -0700 (PDT)\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nHere's an interesting impartial Mancala variant:\n\nStart with some stones in a single row of pits.  Each move starts at one\npit and continues rightwards.  The player to move picks up any nonzero\nnumber of stones from the first pit, and all stones from each successive\npit (even zero if the pit is empty), finally dumping all the picked up\nstones in the last pit of the sequence.  Thus the move is determined by\nthe first pit, number of pits in the sequence, and number of stones\npicked up in the first pit, but those three numbers may be chosen\nindependently by the player.\n\nE.g. from a position (1,3,0,4) you could move to any one of (0,0,0,8),\n(0,0,4,4), (0,4,0,4), (1,0,0,7), (1,0,3,4), (1,1,0,6), (1,1,2,4),\n(1,2,0,5), or (1,2,1,4).\n\nThe game ends when all stones are in the last pit.  Obviously it's not\nvery interesting in normal play (just move everything to the last pit)\nso you play misere.\n\nTo continue the example, (1,1,0,6) would be a winning move: after the\nmoves to (0,0,2,6) or (1,0,0,7) you can move to (0,0,1,7) and after\nother moves you can move to (0,1,1,6) and then (0,0,1,7) next turn.\n\nA strategy stealing argument shows that the first player wins\nfrom (x,0,0,0,0...,0): if the second player had a winning move\nfrom (x-1,1,0,0...,0) then the first player could also move to\nthe same position.  So maybe a better starting position\n(more natural for Mancala like games) would be (x,x,x,x,...,x).\n\nThe question: what more famous combinatorial game is this a disguised\nversion of?
