keep it on your machine,\r\n  in case you need to reinstall Java (not likely necessary).\r\nWhen installed, Java requires about an additional 160 MB of disk space.\r\n<p>\r\nRemember that you must install Java, Python, and Eclipse all as 64-bit\r\n  applications (for some, like Eclipse, you have no choice).\r\n\r\n<!--- 64 bit?\r\n<h3>Downloading</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp\" target = \"_blank\">\r\n      Java Downloads</a>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following page will appear in your browser.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/javadownloadpage.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>Free Java Download</b> red button.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following page will appear in your browser.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/javastartdownloadpage.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    The page should indicate your Operating System: here in red, beneath\r\n      the banner, it says <b>64-bit Java for Windows</b>.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>Agree and Start Free Download</b> red button\r\n    <p>\r\n    This file should start downloading into your standard download folder.\r\n    This file is about 65 Mb, so it may take a few minutes to download.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The file should appear as \r\n    <br>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/downloadfile.jpg\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    Terminate the window browsing the Java download page.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Java\r\n      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>\r\n    Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<h3>Downloading</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp\" target = \"_blank\">\r\n      Java Downloads</a>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following page will appear in your browser.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/javadownloadpagemanual.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the third red-bulleted item <b>Windows Offline</b>.\r\n    This is the 64-bit edition.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following pop-up window titled <b>Opening jre-8u221-windows-x64.exe</b>\r\n      will appear.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/savefile.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Click the <b>Save File</b> button.\r\n    <p>\r\n    This file should start downloading into your standard download folder.\r\n    This file is about 76 Mb, so it may take a few minutes to download.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The file should appear as \r\n    <br>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/downloadfile64.jpg\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    Terminate the window browsing the Java download page.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Java\r\n      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>\r\n    Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Installing</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Double click the <b>jre-8u221-windows-x64.exe</b>\r\n      file that you just downloaded and moved.\r\n    <p>\r\n    When run, a <b>User Account Control</b> pop-up window may appear on your\r\n      screen.\r\n    I could not capture its image, but it asks, \r\n      <b>Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device</b>.\r\n    <!--\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/useraccountcontrol.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    -->\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>Yes</b> button.\r\n    <p>\r\n    A <b>Java Setup - Welcome</b> pop-up window will appear.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/setupwelcome.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>Install &gt;</b> button.\r\n    <p>\r\n    A <b>Java Setup - Progress</b> pop-up window will appear, with the \r\n      following message at the top of the window:\r\n        <b>Status: Installing Java</b>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/setupprogress.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    A green progress bar will appear, showing the progress as it installs\r\n     Java, and will finally disappear (on my machine this took about\r\n     30 seconds).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      If a <b>Java Setup - Uninstall out-of-date versions</b> pop-up window\r\n        appears\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/uninstall.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Click the <b>Uninstall &gt;</b> button;
