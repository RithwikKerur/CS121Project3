As a\nconsequence,\nfor settling the long-standing open problem of obtaining an NC perfect\nmatching\nalgorithm, it suffices to obtain an NC algorithm for the decision problem. We\nbelieve this new\nfact has qualitatively changed the nature of this open problem.\n<p>\nThe difficulty of obtaining an NC perfect matching algorithm led researchers\nto study\nmatching vis-a-vis clever relaxations of the class NC. In this vein, recently\nGoldwasser and\nGrossman [GG15] gave a pseudo-deterministic RNC algorithm for finding a\nperfect matching\nin a bipartite graph, i.e., an RNC algorithm with the additional requirement\nthat on the same\ngraph, it should return the same (i.e., unique) perfect matching for almost\nall choices of\nrandom bits. A corollary of our reduction is an analogous algorithm for\ngeneral graphs.\n<p>\nAn equivalent way of stating our main result is: We give an NC algorithm for\nfinding\na minimum weight perfect matching in a general graph with polynomially\nbounded edge\nweights, provided our algorithm is given access to an oracle for the decision\nproblem. Our\nresult is built on the work of Anari and Vazirani [AV18], which used\nplanarity of the input\ngraph critically; in fact, in three different ways. The main challenge was to\nadapt these steps\nto general graphs by appropriately trading planarity with the use of the\ndecision oracle.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nJoint work with Nima Anari.</p>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
