Perhaps the potential benefit of finding a better solution to a problem might be extraordinary, but you don't always know if your ideas will yield those benefits without trying them out.  But if the experimentation is too costly, you might never be willing to pay the cost of finding out whether your idea is a worthwhile one or not.</p>\n\n<p>Computers have a role to play in situations like this.  At their most fundamental level, computers are tools for automating processes that are otherwise more expensive.  If you have a strategy for solving, say, an engineering problem, and if you could write a program that will show you how your strategy is likely to turn out, you can more cheaply find the answer you're looking for &mdash; should I follow this strategy or not? &mdash; and, if it turns out to be positive, you can proceed with making the bigger investment in trying it out \"for real.\"</p>\n\n<p>Suppose you have an idea for a better design for an airplane wing, a more efficient way to serve customers in a restaurant, or a more profitable way to participate in financial transactions.  Short of observing the actual results of building and testing the new wing, adjusting the way that customers are served, or making a large number of financial transactions in real conditions &mdash; expensive and risky propositions! &mdash; a computer program called a <i>simulation</i> can be developed instead.  Simulations approximate the important parts of a real-world situation &mdash; the physical forces acting on an airplane wing, the movement of customers through a business, the hypothetical change in prices in an financial market &mdash; while ignoring aspects that have little or no affect on the outcome you want to measure.  Depending on how believably the simulation approximates reality, the results of the simulation might well be a reasonably accurate approximation of reality, as well.</p>\n\n<p>In this project, we'll consider a situation like the one described above.  Suppose that the movie theater chain Millennium Cinemas is interested in finding ways to attract customers away from their larger, more well-established rivals.  With the proliferation of \"megaplex\" movie theaters in recent decades, Millennium management believes that one problem that movie-goers face is the long wait in line to buy tickets.  They seek a solution that will allow their customers to spend less time in line, hoping that this will dramatically improve their sales.  It's not in their best interest to spend a lot of time running experiments, especially since some of the things they might want to try could well end up lengthening their customers' waits in line, ultimately hurting their reputation and their business.  (When you're a large company, you can spend money trying things that might have a negative impact, absorb the loss, and move on; when you're small, you don't have this kind of freedom.)</p>\n\n<p>So, to aid in their analysis of the time that customers spend in line, you'll build a program that will simulate various arrangements of lines and ticket windows, to allow them to find the optimal combinations for its theaters.  The project will give you practice implementing your own custom data structure called a <i>queue</i>, while helping you to see the value of \"layering\" a solution to a complex problem.  You'll also have a chance to continue developing your design skills, as you'll be implementing this project mostly from scratch.  Don't worry, though; we'll give you plenty of help along the way.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">The program</p>\n\n<p>Millennium requires a program that will allow them to simulate a variety of arrangements of ticket lines, ticket windows, and patterns of customer arrival.  You will write a program that gives them this flexible simulation ability.  It will allow the user to specify the number of ticket windows, whether there will be a single line or a separate line per window, and the speed at which each ticket attendant can process customers.  Once these simulation parameters have been specified, the program processes a file that indicates the arrival of customers, simulating their arrival into the ticket lines, tracking how long each customer spends in line, and ultimately calculating statistics about them.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Window and line arrangements</p>\n\n<p>Millennium has many different styles of theaters, from single-screen theaters showing classic or foreign films to larger multi-screen varieties showing the latest releases.  The outside areas of all of these theaters, big and small, are organized in the same basic fashion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Tickets are sold in person.  Customers wanting to purchase a ticket walk up to a <i>ticket window</i>, in which an employee of the theater is available to determine what tickets are desired (e.g., what movie, what showing) and to accept payment.  Once a ticket is issued, a customer can leave the ticket window and enter the theater.</li>\n  <li>When customers arrive more quickly than they can be handled at ticket windows, they each stand in a <i>ticket line</i>, while waiting for an available window.  Customers emerge from each line on a first-come-first-served basis.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To support its various sizes and styles of theaters, it wishes to investigate the relative effect of two arrangements of ticket windows and lines.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>One or more ticket windows, each with its own separate ticket line.</li>\n  <li>Multiple ticket windows, and one ticket line that all customers stand in; a customer can proceed from this single line to any available ticket window.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For each arrangement of lines, they will also be interested in investigating the number of windows necessary to support various numbers and patterns of customers.  They will use the simulator to determine the contexts in which each arrangement will be appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>As with many simulations, your goal is not to demonstrate which arrangement is best; your goal is merely to demonstrate the theoretical effect of a particular scenario given as input.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">The input file</p>\n\n<p>In order to simulate different theater configurations, the simulator will need to accept a set of parameters that describe them.  Those parameters will be described in an input file, a text file that specifies the length of the simulation, the number of ticket windows, whether there is a single ticket line or a separate line for each window, and the speed at which customers are processed at each window.  In addition, the input file will contain a sequence of <i>customer arrivals</i>, specifying how many customers will arrive at the theater at which times.  Here is an example of an input file.  (Note that the italicized portions are included here for descriptive purposes only, and would not be included in an actual input file.)</p>\n\n<pre>\nShort simulation     <i>brief description of the simulation</i>\n5                    <i>the length of the simulation, in minutes</i>\n2                    <i>the number of ticket windows</i>\nS                    <i>how many lines: \"S\" for single, \"M\" for multiple</i>\n45                   <i>number of seconds it takes to process a customer at window #1</i>\n35                   <i>number of seconds it takes to process a customer at window #2</i>\n1 30                 <i>one customer arrives 30 seconds into the simulation</i>\n5 35                 <i>five customers arrive 35 seconds into the simulation</i>\n3 45                 <i>three customers arrive 45 seconds into the simulation</i>\n1 60                 <i>one customer arrives 60 seconds into the simulation</i>\n1 90                 <i>one customer arrives 90 seconds into the simulation</i>\nEND                  <i>the \"END\" tag marks the end of the customer arrivals</i>\n</pre>\n\n<p>Notice that the input file is broken into two parts: the <i>configuration section</i>, which describes how the theater is configured (e.g., the arrangement of ticket windows and lines), and the <i>customer arrival</i> section, which lists the arrivals of customers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The configuration section</p>\n\n<p>The first line of the configuration section is a brief description, perhaps a sentence or two, that explains the purpose of the simulation; this is useful to include in the simulation's output, so that it's clear what scenario is being tested.  The next line specifies the length of the simulation, measured in minutes.  Following that, the next line specifies how many ticket windows the simulated theater should have.  This is followed by either <b>S</b> or <b>M</b> on a line by itself, which specifies whether there is a single ticket line or a separate ticket line per window.  Finally, there is a line for each of the windows &mdash; they should be numbered from 1..<i>n</i> &mdash; that states how many seconds it takes the attendant at that window to sell a ticket to a single customer.</p>\n\n<p>There must be a positive number of ticket windows, though there is no pre-defined maximum.  The number of seconds that each attendant takes to process a customer must also be a positive number.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the theater described in this configuration section is an idealization of a real theater; there are some details that have been left out for the purposes of simplicity:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>All windows are always open at all times.</li>\n  <li>The attendant working at a particular window always processes each customer in the same length of time.</li>\n  <li>Attendants don't take breaks and they don't rotate between windows.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We'll see a handful of additional simplifications along the way; they've been made to keep the simulation somewhat simpler and more predictable, at the cost of skewing the results slightly.</p>\n\n<p>After your program has read the configuration section, the simulator should be prepared to begin processing the arrival and departure of customers, so any applicable objects and data structures should have been created and initialized appropriately <i>before</i> reading any of the customer arrivals.</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The customer arrival section</p>\n\n<p>Each line in the customer arrival section of the input file describes the arrival of a number of customers at a particular time.  The time is specified as the number of seconds since the simulation started, and they must increase as the file is processed (i.e., the time on each line in the file must be strictly greater than the time on the line that came before it).  The number of customers on each line must be positive.</p>\n\n<p>When a batch of customers arrives, they each get into a line.  If there is only a single line, obviously they all get into that line.  If there are multiple lines, each customer should be separately processed, each getting into the line that has the fewest number of customers already in it (regardless of whether any corresponding window is occupied).  In the event of a tie, a customer should always get into the lower-numbered line.  There is no maximum number of customers that can be in a particular line, but, in general, they will spread relatively evenly between lines given this rule.</p>\n\n<p>When a window is unoccupied, a customer <i>immediately</i> moves from its corresponding ticket line to the window.  (For example, if a customer departs a window at time 60, another customer will arrive in the window at time 60 if one is waiting in the corresponding line.)  That customer will stay for the appropriate number of seconds.  At that time, the customer will leave the window and will <i>immediately</i> be replaced by another.</p>\n\n<p>For the sake of simplicitly, we'll assume in our simulation that customers never move from one ticket line to another.  In other words, suppose there is a separate ticket line per window.  If there is no one in the first window and no one in the first line, but there are three customers in the second line, we will assume that the customers in the second line <i>will not</i> go to the first widnow.  (Obviously, this is a non-issue when there is only one single line.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Assumptions about the input file</p>\n\n<p>You may assume that the input file is formatted as described above.  You may <i>not</i> assume that it will be exactly the file that we're showing as an example &mdash; and we can guarantee you that we'll test cases other than the one shown as an example &mdash; but you may assume that there won't be a word where a number is expected, a negative number where a positive one is expected, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Given an illegal input file &mdash; one that doesn't follow the rules described &mdash; it's fine for your program to misbehave or even crash.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Running your program</p>\n\n<p>To simplify our testing, there are two rules you'll need to follow in your design.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The \"main\" module that we need to execute when we want to run your simulator <i>must</i> be called <b>simulator.py</b>.</li>\n  <li>When your simulator opens the input file, it should assume that its name is <b>simulation.txt</b> and that it will be located in the same directory as your <b>simulator.py</b> file.\n    <ul>\n      <li>The practical effect of this is that you'd open the input file like this: <b>open('simulation.txt', 'r')</b>, i.e., by specifying the name of the file but not a full path.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We will have some test automation built around these requirements, so be sure to follow them, or we'll find that your program fails all of our tests.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Simulation time</p>\n\n<p>As your simulation progresses, it must keep track of a notion of <i>time</i>.  Things happen in the simulation at specified times &mdash; customers arrive at particular times, they stay in windows for a specified length of time, and so on.  It's important to understand, though, that simulation time is not the same thing as real time.  A simulation that is intended to determine the movement of customers in an eight-hour day at a theater shouldn't take eight hours to run; since there's no visualization component here (i.e., we're not seeing a graphical representation of customers moving around), the only requirement is to see the results, so the goal is to calculate those results as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>The simulation's notion of time is guided by a <i>simulation clock</i>.  Everything scheduled and measured in this simulation is done as a number of seconds, so the clock tracks how many seconds of simulation time have elapsed since the simulation started.  After a simulation has been running for two minutes of simulation time, we'd say that it's <i>time 120</i> on the simulation clock.  Seconds are discrete; there's no notion of a <i>time 120.5</i>, only a <i>time 120</i> and a <i>time 121</i>.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">The simulation log</p>\n\n<p>While the simulation runs, your simulator should print a <i>simulation log</i> to the console.  The simulation log contains a line of output each time something \"interesting\" happens.  Each line of the log should show the current simulation time and a brief description of the event.  Include (at least) these events in your simulation log:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Simulation started</li>\n  <li>Simulation ended</li>\n  <li>Customer entered window #<i>n</i></li>\n  <li>Customer left window #<i>n</i> (spent <i>s</i> seconds at window)</li>\n  <li>Customer entered line #<i>n</i></li>\n  <li>Customer exited line #<i>n</i> (spent <i>s</i> seconds in line)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The simulation log for the example input file</p>\n\n<p>The example input file would produce a simulation log with (at least) these events listed.</p>\n\n<blockquote><pre>\nTime    30 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    30 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 0 seconds in line)\nTime    30 - Customer entered window #1\nTime    35 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    35 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    35 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    35 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    35 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    35 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 0 seconds in line)\nTime    35 - Customer entered window #2\nTime    45 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    45 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    45 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    60 - Customer entered line #1\nTime    70 - Customer left window #2 (spent 35 seconds at window)\nTime    70 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 35 seconds in line)\nTime    70 - Customer entered window #2\nTime    75 - Customer left window #1 (spent 45 seconds at window)\nTime    75 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 40 seconds in line)\nTime    75 - Customer entered window #1\nTime    90 - Customer entered line #1\nTime   105 - Customer left window #2 (spent 35 seconds at window)\nTime   105 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 70 seconds in line)\nTime   105 - Customer entered window #2\nTime   120 - Customer left window #1 (spent 45 seconds at window)\nTime   120 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 85 seconds in line)\nTime   120 - Customer entered window #1\nTime   140 - Customer left window #2 (spent 35 seconds at window)\nTime   140 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 95 seconds in line)\nTime   140 - Customer entered window #2\nTime   165 - Customer left window #1 (spent 45 seconds at window)\nTime   165 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 120 seconds in line)\nTime   165 - Customer entered window #1\nTime   175 - Customer left window #2 (spent 35 seconds at window)\nTime   175 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 130 seconds in line)\nTime   175 - Customer entered window #2\nTime   210 - Customer left window #1 (spent 45 seconds at window)\nTime   210 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 150 seconds in line)\nTime   210 - Customer entered window #1\nTime   210 - Customer left window #2 (spent 35 seconds at window)\nTime   210 - Customer exited line #1 (spent 120 seconds in line)\nTime   210 - Customer entered window #2\nTime   245 - Customer left window #2 (spent 35 seconds at window)\nTime   255 - Customer left window #1 (spent 45 seconds at window)\nTime   300 - Simulation ended\n</pre></blockquote>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">The final report</p>\n\n<p>When the simulation is complete, your simulator should print out the <i>final report</i>.  The final report includes summary statistics about the simulation and should be printed to the console.  The final report must contain the following information.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>For each ticket window (include the window number, where window numbers are sequential starting from 1):\n    <ul>\n      <li>The number of tickets sold at that window.  You may assume that each customer buys exactly one ticket, but do not assume that a customer has purchased a ticket until he or she has left the window.</li>\n      <li>The percentage of time the window spent idle (i.e., with no customer in the window).  You can calculate this by counting the number of seconds when no customer was at that window, then dividing it by the total number of seconds in the simulation.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>For each ticket line (include the line number, where line numbers are sequential starting from 1):\n    <ul>\n      <li>The number of customers still waiting in the line at the end of the simulation.</li>\n      <li>The maximum length that the line ever reached.</li>\n      <li>The average amount of time customers waited in that line.  Count only the customers who reached a window, though you may count them if they are still at the window when the simulation ends.  (This avoids skewing the average lower by including customers who had only just barely arrived when the simulation ended.)</li>\n      <li>The maximum amount of time any customer waited in that line, including customers who are still in line at the time the simulation ends.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Overall:\n    <ul>\n      <li>The total number of tickets sold at all windows.</li>\n      <li>The average amount of time customers waited in line to buy tickets.  Count only the customers who reached a window, though you may count them if they are still at the window when the simulation ends.  (To be clear, this measures only the time spent in line, not the time spent in a window.)</li>\n      <li>The average amount of time each customer spent at a ticket window.  Naturally, you should only count customers who exited the window having bought a ticket, so don't count customers who are still at the window when the simulation ends.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Percentages and fractions should be reported to two decimal places (e.g., \"83.33%\" or \"35.75\").</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The statistics for the example input file</p>\n\n<p>There are the statistics that should appear in your final report after running a simulation given the example input file.  Note that the decimal numbers may be off by a hundredth in some cases for you, depending on how (and whether) you handle rounding, and that's fine.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Window #1\n    <ul>\n      <li>Tickets sold: 5</li>\n      <li>Idle time: 25.00% (75 seconds out of 300)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Window #2\n    <ul>\n      <li>Tickets sold: 6</li>\n      <li>Idle time: 30.00% (90 seconds out of 300)</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Line #1\n    <ul>\n      <li>Customers waiting at simulation end: 0</li>\n      <li>Maximum length: 8 customers</li>\n      <li>Average wait time: 76.82 seconds</li>\n      <li>Maximum wait time: 150 seconds</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Overall\n    <ul>\n      <li>Tickets sold: 11</li>\n      <li>Average wait time: 76.82 seconds</li>\n      <li>Average time spent at a window: 39.55 seconds</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">How about some additional examples?</p>\n\n<p>To test your simulator, you'll want to run more examples than just the one example file that I provided.  However, only one example is being provided here.  Part of the goal of writing a program is to find a way to be sure that it works; that means that you need to test it.  In the case of a simulation, that means you need to come up with some interesting inputs, figure out for yourself what the output should be for each, then see if your program generates the right output.  That's part of what I'm expecting you to do for this project, though you will not be required to submit your additional input files.  In fact, because it can be an arduous task to build input files and figure out what their expected output should be, I encourage you to share your input files and expected outputs with one another, so that everyone can benefit from one another's insights about testing the program.  (Obviously, it should go without saying that you should <i>not</i> be sharing your program code.)</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Some suggestions (and requirements) about the design of your simulator</p>\n\n<p>This is a large problem with a number of moving parts, so there are many ways that you could implement your simulator.  In general, I am not imposing an overall design on you, though I will make a few specific requirements, in addition to the ones listed above in the section titled <i>Running your program</i>; your goal, where you have design freedom, is to find ways to break up large, complex tasks into simpler ones.  Be on the lookout for concepts in the simulation that could nicely be turned into classes or functions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">A linked-list-based queue implementation</p>\n\n<p>As we'll see in lecture, <i>linked data structures</i> such as linked lists provide an alternative to array-based lists like Python's built-in <b>list</b>.  Array-based lists excel in ways that linked lists don't and vice versa, and it's handy to know these differences, so you can make an informed choice when you need to store a list of objects; sometimes, it's vital to make this choice correctly if you want to write a program that will perform reasonably.</p>\n\n<p>Your implementation is required to be broken up into two separate classes: a LinkedList class that implements a singly-linked list with head and tail references, and a Queue class that implements the concept of a queue \"on top of\" the LinkedList class.  (We will see an example of this kind of layering in lecture.)  In particular, you will need to provide (at least) the following functionality in these classes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The LinkedList class must have the following features:\n    <ul>\n      <li>It must be possible to construct a LinkedList with no constructor parameters; the result will be an empty LinkedList object.</li>\n      <li>A method <b>def append(self, item)</b>, which adds an element to the end of the list.  Should run in <i>O</i>(1) time.</li>\n      <li>A method <b>def prepend(self, item)</b>, which adds an element to the front of the list.  Should run in <i>O</i>(1) time.</li>\n      <li>A method <b>def remove_first(self)</b>, which removes the first element of the list (or raises an exception if the list is empty).  Should run in <i>O</i>(1) time.</li>\n      <li>A method <b>def remove_last(self)</b>, which removes the last element of the list (or raises an exception if the list is empty).  Should run in <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) time &mdash; unless you've opted to implement a doubly-linked list with head and tail (which is not required), in which case you'd be able to do this in <i>O</i>(1) time instead.</li>\n      <li>Support for reading the items at various indexes, e.g., given a LinkedList <b>x</b> with many items already stored in it, the expressions <b>x[5]</b>, <b>x[-2]</b>, and <b>x[3:8]</b> would all be legal, with results similar to what you would get with a Python <b>list</b> object.  Should run in <i>O</i>(<i>i</i>) time, where <i>i</i> is the largest index.</li>\n      <li>Support for changing the items at various indexes, meaning that assignments such as <b>x[5] = 'boo'</b> would be legal, too.  Should run in <i>O</i>(<i>i</i>) time, where <i>i</i> is the largest index.</li>\n      <li>Support for deleting the items at various indexes, meaning that the Python syntax <b>del x[5]</b> would be legal, as well.  Should run in <i>O</i>(<i>i</i>) time, where <i>i</i> is the largest index.</li>\n      <li>Support for iterating the items in the list in the forward (first-to-last) direction.

We will be testing your LinkedList and Queue classes separately as part of your grade on this project, so following this naming convention and the implementation requirements above will be important.</p>\n\n<p>Notably, neither your LinkedList nor your Queue classes should be specific to this simulator; they shouldn't include any notion of \"customers\", \"ticket lines\", and so on.  These are tools on top of which you can build bigger things.</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Sanity-checking your LinkedList and Queue classes</p>\n\n<p>As we did in the previous project, we will be testing part of your project &mdash; namely, the LinkedList and Queue classes &mdash; by running a set of unit tests against them, which verify that the behavior described above is present and working as it should.  Once again, it will be necessary that you've spelled and capitalized things correctly, put underscores where they belong, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>To assist you in verifying the presence of the things that are required, below are links to a set of sanity-checking unit tests for your LinkedList and Queue classes.  As in the previous project, they do not assert any behavior, but they do verify that the necessary things are present.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"linkedlist_sanitycheck_tests.py\">linkedlist_sanitycheck_tests.py</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"queue_sanitycheck_tests.py\">queue_sanitycheck_tests.py</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As before, <i>do not</i> include these sanity-check tests in your own set of unit tests; your unit tests should instead focus on whether the necessary functionality does what it should.</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Deciding on your classes</p>\n\n<p>A somewhat simplistic, but often effective, way to break a large design into classes is to consider a description of the desired system and \"look for the nouns.\"  While this technique won't give you a complete or perfect design, it will at least give you a good feel for what the major abstractions in your program are.  Using that approach for this program, you might discover some of the following ideas (and probably others).  Of course, depending on how you describe your program, you may discover different abstractions than these.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><i>Customer</i>.  The simulator is intended to keep track of customers as they enter lines, enter windows, and leave the area with their tickets.</li>\n  <li><i>Queue</i>.  A queue is an object that manages a set of objects waiting in first-come-first-served fashion for access to some shared resource.  In the case of this program, the objects are customers and the shared resource is a ticket window; however, the queue class should be built to be generic, so that it could be reused in other programs.</li>\n  <li><i>Ticket line</i>.  One of the central features of the simulation.  Customers enter at the back of lines, work their way up, then emerge from the front.  This is an example of the concept of a queue, which you will be required to use to implement your ticket line.  A good way to implement your ticket line is to have it contain a queue.  The distinction between a queue and a ticket line is that a queue is generic (i.e., it can store any kind of object) and is intended to be possibly reused in other programs, while a ticket line specifically manages customers and keeps tracks of statistics necessary for this program.</li>\n  <li><i>Ticket window</i>.  Another central feature of the simulation.  One customer at a time can occupy a ticket window.  For each window, there is a predetermined amount of time that each customer will need to spend there.  It is possible for a window to be \"idle\" (i.e., to have no customer in it).  A ticket window will need to keep track of the necessary statistics that are specific to that window.</li>\n  <li><i>Theater</i>.  A broader abstraction for the theater area.  Contains ticket lines and ticket windows.  The purpose of the theater abstraction is to prevent other parts of the program from needing to be aware of the arrangement of lines and windows.  For example, when a customer arrival is processed, the Theater object can be in charge of placing the customers in the appropriate lines.  The Theater object should also track summary statistics for the entire simulation.</li>\n  <li><i>Simulation</i>.  An object that manages the entire simulation, delegating tasks to the theater (which will delegate some tasks to other objects, such as ticket lines and ticket windows).  This is where the input file can be read and processed.  This object will also manage the <i>simulation loop</i>, which I'll describe a bit later.</li>\n  <li><i>Clock</i>.  Since the simulation has a clock that keeps track of the current time, expressed as the number of seconds since the simulation started, it makes sense to have one object, shared by all of these classes, that keeps track of the current time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">The simulation</p>\n\n<p>Your program should load the setup information from the input file first, and then setup the simulation (i.e., create the theater object with the appropriate initial state) based on those values.  From there, you can implement the simulation in various ways, but I suggest the following approach.  (This is by no means the most efficient way to implement such a simulation, but is efficient enough for our purposes, striking a good balance between efficiency and ease of implementation for this course.)</p>\n\n<p>Write a <i>simulation loop</i>, each iteration of which simulates one second.  Each second, the loop performs the following major tasks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Find out what the current simulation time is.  Remember that the current time is tracked as the number of seconds since the simulation started.</li>\n  <li>If new customers are arriving in line at the current time, add them to the appropriate ticket lines.</li>\n  <li>Check each ticket window.  If there is no customer there, the first customer in its corresponding ticket line should be removed from line and arrive at the window.  If there is a customer there, see if the customer is finished.  The customer is finished if she has been at the window for the specified number of seconds.  If the customer is finished, she leaves, and should be immediately replaced by the first customer in the corresponding ticket line (if any).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When the specified number of seconds of simulation time elapse, the simulation ends, and the accumulated statistics should be printed out.</p>\n\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Memory usage</p>\n\n<p>You <i>must not</i> load all of the customer arrivals into memory at the beginning of the simulation.  Instead, you should read the customer arrivals into memory one line at a time, when necessary.  Reading all of the customer arrivals into memory ahead of time will yield a substantial penalty on your <b>Quality of solution</b> score for this project.</p>\n\n<p>Spoken in terms of <i>O</i>-notation, if there are <i>n</i> customer arrivals specified in the input file, you should use <i>O</i>(1) memory to process them; it should be possibly to run a simulation using an input file with billions of customer arrivals &mdash; assuming that this doesn't result in billions of customers standing in lines at the same time &mdash; without running out of memory.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Unit testing</p>\n\n<p>As with recent projects, you will be required to write unit tests using Python's built-in <b>unittest</b> module.  The only things you are required to unit test are your LinkedList and Queue classes, though you can feel free to include as many test modules and test as many parts of your program as you'd like.</p>\n\n<p>There is wisdom in implementing LinkedList and Queue, along with unit tests, before proceeding with the rest of the project, as a \"broken\" implementation of LinkedList and Queue will virtually guarantee that your simulator will have bugs in it.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Limitations</p>\n\n<p>Third-party libraries &mdash; i.e., anything not included in a standard Python 3.3.2 installation &mdash; are strictly off-limits in this project.  Other than the standard Python library, all of the code should be written solely by you.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, pre-existing implementations of linked lists or queues (such as <b>collections.deque</b>) are also off-limits, as one of the objectives of this project is learning to implement your own linked data structures.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Deliverables</p>\n\n<p>Put your name and student ID in a comment at the top of each of your <b>.py</b> files, then submit all of the files to Checkmate.
