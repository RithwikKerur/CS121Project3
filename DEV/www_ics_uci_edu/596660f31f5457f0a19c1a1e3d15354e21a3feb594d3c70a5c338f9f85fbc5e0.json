Rarely does the opportunity arise to chronicle the \ndvelopement of an <b>entirely</b> new country, from its nascent ideological \ninception to its physical creation and developement.  The <i>Atlantis \nProject</i> has come up with plans to literally build a new island, to be \ncalled <a \nhref=\"http://saturn.uaamath.alaska.edu/~kane/oceania_info.html\">Oceania</a>.  You can obtain information on Oceania's Constitution and laws, as well as its conceptual founders and information on obtaining a passeport, by investigating <a href=\"http://satu\n\nrn.uaamath.alaska.edu/~kane/oceania_start.html\"> The Atlantis Project</a>.  An interesting prospect for the fringe element.   \nQuery: can we send people there involuntarily?

He lived from 1705-1782, \nso obviously there is no extant recording of his voice.  To enhance a film dedicated to Farinelli by \nGerard Corbiau, an organization called \n<I>Ircam</I> engineered a voice that is beyond the scope of current performers.  <i>En francais.</I>  One \ncan also get information (in French or in English) on <A HREF= \n\"http://www.ircam.fr/solidarites/sida/index-e.html\">HIV and AIDS</A>, including counselling and support, \nfree and anonymous testing centers, health organizations, and more from \nthe Pompidou Center.  If it weren't for Steve Franklin's hotlist, I don't \nknow that I would ever have come across this information.  Thank goodness \nfor this class!\n\n <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to \nlist of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>What is HTML, and where can I learn how to \ncreate an HTML\n   document\n?</H2></A> Ahhhh, the excitement of HTML.    HTML, or <i>hypertext markup \nlanguage</i> provides structure to documents on the World Wide Web.  HTML \nuses a series of codes to transmit data, which are in turn translated by a \nclient (such as \nMosaic, Lynx, or Viola, for example) into recognizable screen formats.  \nThe most valuable aspect of HTML lies in its inherently interactive \nnature; one can \"click\" on highlighted text with the aid of a favorite \nrodent, connecting to to new links, \nmaps, images, headings, etc. in order to continue a certain search path \nor to veer \nonto another search course.  HTML is still inferior to most desktop \npublishing programs,  with constraints on font selection and graphics \nplacement, and many limitations on relatively simple functions.  For a \ngood introduction to HTML, try the <a \nhref=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html\">Beginners Guide to HTML</a>, which covers the basic elements of creating an HTML document.  Next you may want to reference <a href=\"http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/strict-html-single.html\"> Composing Good HTML</a>, which can help with troubleshooting and improper use of various commands.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>What do the South Georgia and Sandwich Islands \nhave in common with Montserrat?</a>  <i> Formerly \"Where can I get my daily \nTarot and I Ching readings on line?\"</H2></i>\n<a href=\"http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/220.html\">  South Georgia, the \nSouth Sandwich Islands,</a> and <a \nhref=\"http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/164.html \n\">Montserrat</a> are all islands administered by the U.K.    Montserrat is \nlocated in the Carribean, about 400 miles southeast of Puerto Rico, while \nthe South Georgian and Sandwich islands nestle in near Argentina.  \nArgentina claims that the nearby islands belong to them, but Brittain \nmaintains control.  Montserrat \nhas an indigenous population of about 12,701, while South Georgia is \npopulated only by the folks in a small military garrison; the South \nSandwich islands are uninhabited.  All are subject to volcanic activity, \nall count fishing as an important natural resource, and all are under \nChief of State Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n<p>   <A HREF=\"#questions\">\n<it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n</UL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted January 30, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
