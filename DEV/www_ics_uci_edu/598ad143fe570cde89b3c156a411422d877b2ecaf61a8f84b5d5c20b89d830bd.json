As we will\ndescribe in Section 5, it is sufficient to just store a short summary of a\nfile.<p>\n<sup>2</sup> In addition, it contains a function to retrieval and locally store\nthe HTML source of all links accessible from the current page.  Syskill &amp;\nWebert analyzes the HTML source of a page to determine whether the page matches\nthe user's profile.  To avoid network transmission overhead during our\nexperiments, we prefetch all pages. This also ensures that experience are\nrepeatable if a page changes or is no longer accessible.<p>\n<sup>3</sup> <sup>Although it would be possible to use an incremental learning\nalgorithm, our current implementation is not incremental.</sup><p>\n<sup>4</sup> We have created a local copy of this page, removing much of the\nin-line graphics, since access to the full page at the remote site was slow and\nunreliable. <p>\n<sup>5</sup> We experimented with a variant of TF-IDF that operated on 128\ninformative words. It did not perform as well as TF-IDF operating on all\nwords.<p>\n<sup>6</sup> This differs slightly from the previous average for naive Bayes\nbecause a different set of random examples was used in this experiment.<p>\n<sup>7</sup> Of course, some pages may be considered interesting to a user not\nbecause of the content but because they point to many interesting pages. We do\nnot believe Syskill &amp; Webert users consider such pages interesting because\nSyskill and Webert requires a user to associate an index page with each topic\nand this already contains many links.\n</body></html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
