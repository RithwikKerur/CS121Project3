This result improves\nupon the previous best time bound of $O(nm + n^2 \\log\\log n)$. Our\nalgorithm first determines the cycle with minimum mean length\n$\\lambda^*$ in $O(nm)$ time. Subsequently, it chooses node potentials\nso that all reduced costs are $\\lambda^*$ or greater. It then solves\nthe all pairs shortest path problem, but restricts attention to paths\nof length at most $n\\lambda^*$. We speed up the shortest path\ncalculations to $O(m)$ per source node, leading to an $O(nm)$ running\ntime in total. We also carry out computational experiments comparing\nthe performance of the proposed methods and other state-of-the-art\nmethods. Experiments confirmed that it is advantageous to solve the\nminimum mean cycle problem prior to solving shortest path\nproblems. Analysis of our experiments suggest that the running time to\nsolve the minimum length directed cycle problem was much faster than\n$O(n^2)$ on average.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1.9781611974782.122\">a paper from SODA 2017</a> by James Orlin and Antonio Sede&ntilde;o-Noda.)\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
