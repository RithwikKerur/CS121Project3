The Internet consists of many internetworked networks,\ncalled internets (with a small <I>i</I>).  An internet is a single network that uses the TCP/IP\nprotocol suite, and some internets are not connected to the Internet.  There are some <A \nHREF=http://www.uwm.edu/Mirror/inet.services.html <b>Special Internet \nConnections</b></A> which contains \ninformation on games, business, science, computers, recipes, and much more.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>How can students communicate to other students around the\nworld?</B></A><br>\nWhen I took the courses Multicultural Education and Theory and Practice here at UCI, I was told that \nthere are ways that students can communicate to other students around the world.  So, when I was \nexploring the World Wide Web, I was able to find that the University of Michigan Dewey School of Education\nhad the <A HREF=http://ics.soe.umich.edu/ <b>Dewey Web</b></A>.  There \nwas also a hotlist of K-12 Internet \nSchool Sites in <A HREF=http://www.wentworth.com/cyber/k12sites.html \n<b>K-12 World Wide Web Sites</b></A> \nwhere I could find out which schools are listed. \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>How can I get involved and get teacher training in NASA Langley Research Center's \nHPPC K-12 Program?</B></A><br>\nI have heard of Project Smart, a program for those interested in teaching in the fields of science\nand mathematics.  I also know that the HPPC (High Performance Computing and Communications) K-12 \nis an education program that focuses on enhancing the science and mathematics curriculum. To get \ninvolved, one must learn more about it.  So, I have been looking through its \n<A HREF=http://k12mac.larc.nasa.gov/hpcck12home.html <b> Program Elements \n</b></A> to find out if \nthey have any presentations of the program and if they offer any type of training sessions. There's \nso many programs that are available out there.  Some could be found in \n<A HREF=http://akebono.standford.edu/yahoo/Education/Programs<b> Educational \nPrograms</b>.</A>\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>How would I find out if Canadian Airlines has a direct flight to Vancouver? \nAlso, how is the weather like over there?</B></A><br>\nIf you like traveling, Canada would be a great place to go.  Just choose \na date and then buy a ticket from Canadian Airlines.  If you want to find \nout about their airline services, destinations, or find out how the \nweather is like, you could do so.  You just have to look at the <A \nHREF=http://www.CdnAir.CA/ <b> Canadian Airlines International</b></A> \nhome page.  You could also check the weather by using the <A \nHREF=http://rs560.cl.msu.edu/weather/interactive.html <b> Weather \nBrowser</b></A>.  After you have done so, you are ready to enjoy your trip.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 10, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
