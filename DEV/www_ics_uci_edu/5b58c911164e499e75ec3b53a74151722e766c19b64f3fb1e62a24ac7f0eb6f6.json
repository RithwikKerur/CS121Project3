In medical work, the modern patient's body Foucault has\rso aptly described is produced throug\n\n\nh embodied, materially heterogeneous work\r- and the medical record plays a crucial role in this production. It does not\rsimply represent this body's history and geography: it is a central element in\rthe material re-writing of these. Simultaneously, the re\n\n\ncord fulfills a core\rrole in the production of a <i>body politic</i>. As the record is involved in\rthe performance of the patient's body, it is also involved in the performance\rof the <i>clinic</i> in which that body comes to life. Finally, we argue that<\n\n\ni>different</i> records, different practices of reading and writing are\rintertwined with the production of different patient's bodies, bodies politic,\rand bodies of knowledge. As organizational infrastructure, the medical record\raffords the interplay and \n\n\ncoordination of divergent worlds. Seen in this light,\ras a site where multiple stories about patients and about organizations are at\rstake (including the interoperability between these stories), the medical\rrecord becomes highly relevant both analytically\n\n\n and politically. <p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r\tIn his <i>Birth of the Clinic</i>, Foucault argues that the classical,\rpre-modern \"medicine of species\" required a two-dimensional table as an\rintermediary between the individual body and medical knowledge (1973/1963). T\n\n\nhe\rtable would translate individual symptoms: it would yield the true nature of\rthe disease by showing how they fitted into the eternal scheme of things.\rSymptoms were not the disease itself: they were pointers to this higher truth,\rwhich merely \"precipit\n\n\nated\" in individual bodies, and which the table could\rdecode. In contrast to the medicine of species, Foucault argues, the modern\rclinical gaze requires no such intermediary. Truth is no longer found and\rorganized elsewhere in some grand nosological schem\n\n\ne, but rather in the\rpathological processes of individual bodies. The gaze deciphers this truth by\rfollowing the symptoms inwards, eliciting signs, and differentiating the\rpathological reality that now <i>is</i> the disease.<p>\r\tYet the development of thi\n\n\ns gaze depended crucially on the development of some\rnew intermediaries. <i>Writing </i>was crucial in this new configuration.\r\"Medicine no longer tried to see the essential truth beneath the sensible\rindividuality; it was faced by the task of perceiving,\n\n\n and to infinity, the\revents of an open domain\" (Foucault 1973, p. 98). In order to develop a body of\rtrue knowledge, medicine had to record individual cases: only in the\raccumulation of such experience, only in the totality of observers/observations\rcoul\n\n\nd true knowledge be generated (Fagot-Largeault, 1989; Dagognet 1970). A\rcascade of inscriptions, to use Latour's term, typified and produced the\rpossibility of this means of knowing (Latour 1987; 1993, pp. 171-225).<p>\r\tAlthough Foucault does not discuss \n\n\nthis in the <i>Birth of the Clinic</i>,\rknowing <i>in the practice of medicine</i> is similarly dependent on writing.\rThe power of the gaze, in other words, would not go very far if it stood\risolated (<i>cf</i>. Atkinson 1995, pp. 60-65). No longer typifi\n\n\ned by the\rmetaphorical two-dimensional table Foucault describes, modern medicine could\rnot be imagined without that other object of consultation: the medical record.\rIn this paper, we argue that the medical record is fundamental to the everyday\rproduction\n\n\n of that contemporary body whose archeology Foucault describes (a\rbody which hides the essences of the disease in the pathological processes\rtaking place in its tissues; where the symptoms and signs attest to a reality\rwhich is never completely accessible\n\n\n in life) and to the everyday production of\rthe organizations which enact and treat it. <p>\r\tHow is the patient's body produced in hospital wards? How is its specific\rgeometry and its historicity created? How is the patient's body transformed\rfrom the liv\n\n\ned body of Mr. Thompson into a juxtaposition of organs, parameters,\rrows of numbers, graphs, and so forth? Is this through a specific way of\r<i>looking</i>? Or is this a discursive transformation, achieved through\r<i>talk </i>(as is a frequent focus of so\n\n\ncial constructivist medical\rsociology)?<a href=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[1]</a>(see e.g. Davis 1986; ten Have\r1994) We will maintain that the body is produced through embodied, materially\rheterogeneous work (Hirschauer 1991; Cussins 1996). Much comes into pla\n\n\ny here:\rurine containers, infusion pumps, nursing routines, doctor's consultations, and\rso forth. All these artifacts, individuals and organizational routines are\rintermediaries which together perform the medical body. Following recent\rdevelopments in sci\n\n\nence and technology studies (Bijker and Law 1992; Clarke and\rFujimura 1992; Latour 1996; Star 1995), we argue that they constitute the\rnetwork, or the <i>dispositif </i>within which the body acquires its specific\rontology. We focus on the medical record b\n\n\necause this artifact occupies a\rcentral niche in this network: it is where many of the nurses and physician's\rtasks begin, end, and are coordinated, where inscriptions accumulate, and where\rthe specific spaces and times we will describe unfold. The record\n\n\n does not\rmerely mirror the bodies it maps, we argue - but neither does it determine\rthem. To emphasize the active role of artifacts without falling into\rtechnological determinism, we use the term \"mediation\" (Latour 1994): the\rrecord <i>mediates</i> the \n\n\nrelations that it organizes, the bodies that are\rconfigured through it.<p>\r\tFollowing Foucault, we stress that these practices of reading and writing are\rnot only central to the production of a patient's body: they also fulfill a\rcore role in the producti\n\n\non of a <i>body politic</i>. As the record is involved\rin the performance of the patient's body Foucault so aptly describes, it is\ralso involved in the performance of the <i>clinic</i> in which that body comes\rto life. A specific configuration of the body\n\n\n cannot be cut loose from the\rspecific social position different health professionals have within hospitals,\rand with the type of stories about the work done that can emerge from the\rrecords. To strengthen both these points, we make a third argument which\n\n\n\rdeparts from the Foucauldian scheme.<a href=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[2]</a> We\rargue that <i>different</i> records, different practices of reading and writing\rare intertwined with the production of <i>different</i> patient's bodies,\rdifferent bodies politic\n\n\n, and different bodies of knowledge. <p>\r\tIn the first section, we look in some detail at a medical record taken from an\roncology ward from a Dutch University Hospital. Here we concentrate on the\rproduction of patient's bodies. In the second section, we c\n\n\noncentrate on the\rway in which the medical record shapes various bodies politic. We explore some\rmore general developments in the area of medical record keeping such as the\rincreasing attention to coding and classification, and the attempts to produce\ran \n\n\nelectronic medical record. In each section we look first at the general\rprocess of production of the body/the body politic and then look at the\rpractice of multiplicity (managing the articulation of multiple bodies/bodies\rpolitic).<p>\r\tThroughout, we will\n\n\n be using a broad definition of the medical \"record\" as all\rwritten, typed or electronically stored traces of any aspect of patient\rtreatment that has official status within the hospital system and is in\rprinciple stored for a period of time (at least equ\n\n\nal to the patient's stay in\rthe hospital; see e.g. Huffman 1990). More often than not, this implies that\rthe \"medical record\" is not one single object: rather, it is the record the\rphysicians keep in one folder at the outpatient clinic together with the (\n\n\nalso\roften physically separate) nursing and physician's \"in house\" record, with the\rseparate forms created and used in the hospital administration offices - and so\rforth.<p>\r\tThis paper is not primarily concerned with practices of reading and writing\rwhic\n\n\nh bring the record to life (see Berg 1996 for this approach); it is\rconcerned, rather, with mapping the configurations it helps bring into being.\rWe will thus not be looking at the real-time articulation work that links the\rrecord to the ongoing work, or \n\n\nat the informal organizations that\rinterpenetrate the more formal body politics. These are crucial issues (see\re.g. Suchman 1987; Star 1995), but we want to explore here how the structuring\rof the record speaks to the structuring of the bodies we investig\n\n\nate. It is a\rsynchronic exercise to explore just how a mundane, boring artifact like a\rmedical record is involved in the politically charged production of human\rbodies, organizational hierarchies, and selective memories.<p>\r\tThe paper is based on two line\n\n\ns of research. Marc Berg has spent several\rmonths in different wards in various hospitals in the Netherlands, focusing on\rthe role of artifacts such as records and protocols in the ongoing processes of\rmedical work (see e.g. Berg 1997). Geoffrey Bowker ha\n\n\ns studied the history of\rmedical records and has through a series of interviews and observations traced\rthe development of a nursing classification scheme designed for incorporation\rwithin hospital information systems.<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<b>PRODUCING BODI\n\n\nES</b><p>\r<b></b><p>\r<b></b>\tMr. Wood is a patient on the Dutch University Hospital oncology ward.\rImagine a newly arrived oncologist, who begins her shift on this ward. She\rmeets Mr. Wood without having his medical record to hand. She sees a middle\raged,\n\n\n somber looking man, probably suffering from cancer since this is the\roncology ward. Questioning him or the personnel on the ward, she may elicit a\rstory of Hodgkin's disease, which has been treated once before, but which has\rrecurred. Investigating him m\n\n\night yield some more clues as to the spread of the\rdisease, the side effects of his treatment, his general condition. Without the\rrecord, she might sense the damage the cancer has done, and conclude that the\rprognosis is poor. Yet she would excuse herself\n\n\n and not take any action before\rhaving seen the record. Without the record, she is without memory, without a\rdevice to structure her thought; despite all her years of experience, she is\rbarely more able to proceed than the recently graduated resident who \n\n\nstands\rbesides her.<a href=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[3]</a><p>\r\tWith the record, things are different. This record comprises some 120 pages,\rproducing a fascinating, detailed yet jagged and dispersed memory of the\rpatient. It starts with the temperature list \n\n\n(Figure 1): an unfolding sheet\rwhich is structured like a flow-chart, wherein blood pressure, pulse,\rtemperature, medications and so forth are logged. Next is the order form, on\rwhich physicians write down any diagnostic steps and changes in treatment for\n\n\n\rnursing staff to effectuate. Then come the physician's progress notes, starting\rwith a few pre-structured forms which summarize the patient's medical history\rat the date of admission, and followed by over twenty, unstructured pages of\rdaily notes. These \n\n\nare followed by computer print outs from the laboratory\rinformation system (listing rows of numbers indicating outcomes of laboratory\rtests performed on the patient's blood and urine), results from bacteriological\rtests and X-rays (altogether over twenty \n\n\npages), letters written about Mr.\rWood, and so forth.<p>\r<p>\rFIGURE 1 HERE<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<i>History</i><p>\r<i></i><p>\r\tThe record produces a patient with a medical <i>history: </i>the accumulation\rof sets of traces configures a medical past for a specific pa\n\n\ntient.<a\rhref=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[4]</a> The temperature list maps the different\rparameters against time - the <i>x</i>-axis of this flow chart. Lines divide\rthe sheet into weeks and days, and thinner lines divide the upper, graphical\rpart of the sheet \n\n\neven further into eight-hour periods. Temperature, pulse and\rrespiration rate can be entered along the <i>y</i>-axis. Below this, the\r<i>y</i>-axis changes its role. It becomes a list of different parameters:\rtension, weight, specific gravity of the urine\n\n\n, bleeding time (both not filled\rin on this form), and the medication given. Presenting them in this way\rclarifies how changes in one are temporally related to changes in another - yet\rtheir vertical order is arbitrary. Further below, the <i>y</i>-axis ch\n\n\nanges\ragain: here it incorporates a mathematical operation. The different infusions\rlisted add up to total fluid intake (\"totale vochtopname\"), followed by the\rdifferent varieties of fluid loss that result in total fluid loss. These totals\rare then subtra\n\n\ncted, resulting in the last row on this sheet: the fluid\rbalance.<p>\r\tThe forms listing the laboratory results are structured in a similar fashion:\rcolumns of figures, each column indicating a time at which the blood was\rtested. Reading such forms from le\n\n\nft to right, one enters the past in a most\rorderly fashion: step by step, day by day, or even hour by hour, the same\rvariable is followed back through time. This produces a linear, stable history;\rthis activity <i>performs </i>the temporality that Foucaul\n\n\nt saw as a crucial\rinnovation of the modern, clinical gaze. It generates a body with a set of\rvariables whose mutual interrelations and deviations can be traced. The body\racquires a double continuity: it acquires a past through recurring variables\rdistrib\n\n\nuted throughout an evenly flowing time, and this past <i>itself</i>\rremains constant over time. Whether a doctor looks at these traces one day or\rone month later, this past does not change. (As we will see later, this\rconstancy is not characteristic of al\n\n\nl the histories produced in the record,\rnor does it imply a unified history).<p>\r\tHistory is also produced by putting new forms (such as X-ray reports) in front\rof the previous form in that section. This does not produce the graphical\roversight that a flo\n\n\nw sheet format provides, but through for example flipping\rthrough the bacteriology reports, the doctor again finds herself traveling back\rand forth through linear time, accelerating and decelerating where necessary.\rThrough compressing several weeks of re\n\n\nports into a few seconds, the doctor\rleaves the time zones of everyday medical work and enters the temporal order of\rpathological processes of Foucault's body: the record produces <i>textbook\r</i>time. The growth of a tumor as witnessed on successive X-ra\n\n\nys, the battle\rbetween microorganisms and antibiotic regimes, and the rise and fall of blood\rcells as the chemotherapy does its work - these are not events which take place\rwithin the time zones of a working day. Fluctuations in blood cell levels only\rbec\n\n\nome meaningful over a several day period, and the \"growth of a tumor\"\runfolds over several weeks. Since the rows of blood cell levels on one page\rcover some ten days, and the X-ray reports over a two month period usually only\rcover a few pages, the record\n\n\n elegantly affords this crossing between time\rzones.<a href=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[5]</a><p>\r\tThe physician's progress notes and letters, finally, generate a history in a\rsomewhat different way. As the pages of the progress notes fill up, the\rsequence of e\n\n\nntries can certainly be read much as the sequence of bacteriology\rreports or laboratory tests: re-winding time backwards to generate an image of\revents taking place in a different temporal order. Yet most entries themselves\rstart out with a short \"summary\n\n\n\" of the case, as follows:<p>\r<p>\r\tNow 8 days post-reinfusion\t\t\t<i>(of his bone marrow cells)</i><a\rhref=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[6]</a><p>\r\tLast night started \tamica 2 x 700\t\t<i>(these are antibiotics)</i><p>\r\t\t\t\tripera 4 x 4 gr.<p>\r\tOrigin?\t\t\t\t\t\t<i>(... of\n\n\n the fever)</i><p>\r\t<i>(From Mr. Wood's record)</i><p>\rIn these summaries, the \"current situation\" is deduced from other entries in\rthe record, the new laboratory results, information from nurses and the\rpatient, and so forth. The starting point of that d\n\n\nay's deliberations is\rformulated in a single phrase uninterpretable out of the context of the other\rentries. These summaries are read, re-read, re-written in the light of new\revents, summarized again, and continually constitute a brief patient's history\ra\n\n\ns relevant at that particular juncture (Berg 1996). Glancing through a few\rrecent pages of progress notes, then, is often the preferred way for a novel\rphysician to \"eyeball\" a patient's current situation: to build a multi-layered\rhistory of pathological \n\n\nprocesses, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures,\rintertwined with organizational routines (such as who was the responsible\rphysician when, where was the patient sent to), and so forth.<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<i>Geography</i><p>\r<p>\r\tThe record also produces an anato\n\n\nmical <i>geography</i>. Its different\rsections detach the blood from its vessels, split its constituents, juxtapose\rthe organs. The case history form separates several \"organ systems\", as do the\rnursing history forms; the X-ray reports delineate the \"thor\n\n\nax\", the \"abdomen\",\rand all the structures that can be seen within these bodily cavities.\rOrthogonal to the creation of a linear history, here anatomical orders are\rproduced which perform the textbook medical body. The record thus also performs\ra dislocat\n\n\nion in <i>space</i> (Latour 1987): it performs an in-vivo dissection,\rfleshing out a map to the terrain that is hidden under the patient's skin. This\rmap affords a linkage of anatomical realities analogous to the time travel\rdescribed above. Juxtaposing t\n\n\nhe radiographic reports from Mr. Wood with the\rphysical examination and the laboratory results allows the physician to trace\rthe spread of the cancer and to weigh the damage done by the chemotherapy.<p>\r\tBut what does it mean, exactly, to say that the rec\n\n\nord \"produces\" a patient's\rhistory or geography? Of course, Mr. Wood's record is productive of narrative\rin the banal sense that people tend to read a narrative structure into any set\rof facts and figures: Boland (1993) has shown how, read by accountants,\n\n\n two\rdifferent sets of balances sheets can give rise to the most varied conjectures\rabout the personal lives and professional competence of their peers. Yet we\rwant to go further. We are <i>not</i> arguing that the record produces a\rhistory or geography b\n\n\ny creating a specific representation of the body, while\rleaving the \"real\" patient's body untouched. It is not a matter of merely\rproducing a particular discourse, a specific rhetoric about a body. The medical\rrecord is not simply a post hoc depiction of \n\n\ntimes passed and spaces explored:\rit feeds into the very constitution of these times and spaces. The medical\rrecord is a <i>distributing and collecting device</i> (Berg 1996): work tasks\rbegin and end there. It produces the patient's history by sequential\n\n\nly\rdemanding that the same measurements be made again and again (according to the\rdensity of the <i>x</i>-axis). In order to produce the evenly distributed\rgraphs and tables, these measurements have to be meticulously timed: every day,\rstandard blood test\n\n\ns are performed, bacteriological cultures are taken; and\revery eight hours, nurses measure the temperature and the pulse. Every day,\rphysicians produce a new summary of the situation which forms the basis for\rthat day's diagnostic and therapeutic interven\n\n\ntions. The end result is not a\r\"medical\" history which is clearly distinguishable from the history of Mr.\rWood. The production of this representation can only occur with the concurrent\rtransformation of that which is represented. The meticulous organizati\n\n\nonal\rroutines into which the patient is \"hooked\" totally transform and control the\rpatient's previous time zones - determining when the patient sleeps,\rstructuring the days, and transforming the very experience of the flow of time\r(Frankenberg 1992; Roth \n\n\n1979/1963; Star and Bowker 1994). The body is thus\rre-written in bureaucratic format: the weekly, daily and eight-hour cycles\rwhich now structure the patient's time closely match the doctor's and nurses'\rshifts, the opening and closing hours of the labora\n\n\ntory, and the measurement\runits of the financial administration (Zerubavel 1979). Again, this is not\rmerely a different, professional \"reading\" of the body. The body is materially\rreconfigured - its flesh is part and parcel of the discursive transformatio\n\n\nns\rwe witness here. In Star and Bowker's terms, we witness a <i>convergence</i>\rbetween body and representation: in its production, the representation\rinscribes itself in the body it represents (1994).<p>\r\tIt is this re-written body, subsequently, which i\n\n\ns the site of the diagnostic\rand therapeutic interventions. At this point, it becomes meaningless to debate\rwhether these interventions address the body \"itself\" or its representation,\rsince it is <i>in and through</i> this representation that the body \"i\n\n\ntself\" is\rknown, surveyed and intervened upon. Peaks in the temperature curve will prompt\rthe administration of a certain antibiotic - whose effect subsequently is also\rmonitored in that graph, and in the temporal changes in the laboratory values\rregister\n\n\ning the organ functions that might be affected by this drug. Not only\rdo the record's pre-formatted time zones inscribe itself into the patient's\rbody: all medical activities are started, followed up and evaluated within the\rtime zones produced by the rec\n\n\nord. Most of the relevant historical events in\rthe hospitalized patient's life become events triggered by orders written in\rthe record - procedures set in motion by specific forms; therapeutic dosages\rre-adjusted because of an increase in a certain labora\n\n\ntory variable - as\rgleaned from the record.<p>\r\tWhile the patient's time is morphed into the record's time, the patient's\rgeography is rewritten as well. As Hirschauer has so beautifully argued, the\rsurgeon who operates on a body meticulously prepares and\n\n\n carves out the tissues\r<i>so that they map the anatomical atlas</i>. The atlas does not simply figure\ras the \"ground\" of objective knowledge, immediately visible in individual\rpatient's bodies. Rather, this visibility is the outcome of the surgeon's\r\"scu\n\n\nlptured practice\": \"the proper anatomy of the ideal body is engraved ...\rinto the patient-body\" (1991). In an analogous fashion, the record inscribes a\rgeography. The forms physicians and nurses use in their investigations of the\rpatient body invariably d\n\n\nelineate the organ systems. A form used in an\rintensive care unit, for example, listed the categories under \"physical\rexamination\" as follows:<p>\r<p>\rgeneral impression<p>\rcentral nervous system<p>\rcardial<p>\rpulmonal<p>\rabdomen<p>\rurogenital<p>\rextremiti\n\n\nes<p>\r<p>\rSimilarly, many laboratory tests are categorized anatomically: \"liver\rfunction\", \"renal function\", \"pulmonary function\". In this way, through\rcategorizing observations and substances from the body, the record carves out\ran anatomy. And it is thi\n\n\ns \"geographicalized\" body which is subsequently\rintervened upon: drug dosages are adjusted to correct a decreasing liver\rfunction, antibiotics are geared towards a possible focus for infection seen on\ran X-ray, and tubes and monitor cables are put in plac\n\n\ne to monitor the\rcardio-vascular circulation. As above, in an ever tightening cycle, the\rpatient's body <i>becomes</i> its representation. Information required by the\rrecord or written in the record leads to interventions on the patient's body as\rit is re\n\n\npresented in the record. Again, the record does not simply describe a\rpatient's body: it structures the way the patient's body is rewritten. The\rcategorization of observations and substances is only a first step in a\rcontinuing sequence of events, in whic\n\n\nh the individual anatomical systems\rbecome the center for specific interventions by different specialists. Fluids\rand medication are given to correct urogenital problems, a chest is punctured\rto restore a deflated lung to its proper form, and postures hav\n\n\ne to be taken to\rshoot the X-ray right: in mapping the patient, the patient's body is\rreconfigured so that it <i>matches its map</i>. <p>\r\tThe record is of course not the only element active in these rewriting\rprocesses. Only as a part of a interlocked se\n\n\nries of elements does the record\rcome to life; only when linked to nursing and laboratory routines, tubes,\rinfusion bags and cables, the hospital information system and so forth does a\rnetwork emerge which <i>as a whole</i> performs the transformations de\n\n\nscribed.\rAnd the record's structure does not \"determine\" the nursing routines in any\rsimple way: these routines and the record's current structure have emerged\rtogether, mirroring one another and interlocking in historically specific ways\r(Berg forthcomin\n\n\ng). Yet the record is one turning point in the cycle of\rinscriptions that circulate through these interlinked entities. It is where the\rinscriptions end up, are matched and rearranged, and where new\rinscription-yielding activities begin.<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<i>Mul\n\n\ntiplicity</i><p>\r<p>\r\tThe rewriting processes described above do not produce a single coherent and\rtransparent patient's body, mapped into Euclidean space. Medical practice is\rnot a unitary apparatus \"disciplining\" the patient's body into some\rfree-floati\n\n\nng, similarly unitary biomedical entity (Haraway 1991; Hirschauer\rand Mol 1995). Focusing again on the medical record, we could say that it\rconstitutes <i>multiple</i> histories. It encompasses multiple layers: time\rflows faster in some sections than in o\n\n\nthers. The temperature curve exists in\rtime measured in hours, while X-ray's exist in time measured in days. Some\rpages capture a time span of two months, while other pages cannot hold even a\rsingle day.<p>\r\tAnd these histories do not simply fold into one\n\n\n another. The flow chart links\rseveral histories by mapping them on a similar <i>x</i>-axis - yet even here\rthe histories remain relatively self-contained. The fluid balance, for example,\ris produced as a closed system, with a rhythm and an internal logic\n\n\n which is\rtransparent. Daily, a single number results which \"represents\" the fluid\rbalance of this particular patient. And the temperature curve is similarly\rclear-cut: it is a graph mapping the evolution of the patient's body\rtemperature over eight-hour \n\n\nperiods. Yet the interrelation between these two\rhistories is not self-evident. The only direct linkage (Mol forthcoming)\rproduced by the record is a temporal co-occurence. But how are the peaks\rrelated to the numbers? Are they? What is their joint histor\n\n\ny?<p>\r\tSuch links are sometimes made in other parts of the record: especially in\rprogress notes. A high temperature reading may be linked to a negative fluid\rbalance record by the story that the former causes dehydration. Yet the\rprogress notes only refer\n\n\n to a fraction of all the data listed in the record.\rMore often than not, the X-ray reports, temperature curve, fluid balance,\rlaboratory values and so forth remain unconnected, in their own time zones. And\reven <i>if </i>they are connected through the pr\n\n\nogress notes, another\rcomplication of the image of a fully integrated,\nunitary, Euclidean body\rarises. Where the flow chart and the series of\nX-ray reports produce a series\rof - often separate - linear histories, the\nprogress notes contain non-linear</\n\n\ni> histories. The summaries extract and condense time to match\rthe current situation. Moreover, they continually reconstruct these histories\rwhenever the current situation is changed. The progress notes do not build up\rlinear histories like a flow chart d\n\n\noes. Rather, a history of the patient\revolves <i>in</i> the progress notes, changing whenever the current situation\rchanges. Links are forged to the linear histories evolving elsewhere in the\rrecord, but these links are constantly reconstructed, removed a\n\n\nnd retrofitted\rwhenever the current situation alters. What is a crucial temperature peak at\rtime <i>t</i>, may become a singular, non-relevant reading later, and be\rforgotten in the next summary. And what is described as a sequenced chain of\revents at som\n\n\ne stage in the progress notes, gets summarized into a singular\r\"event\" later on. At the eighth day after the reinfusion of Wood's bone marrow\rcells, the summary in the progress notes starts out with \"now 8 days\rpost-reinfusion\", and then states \"last nigh\n\n\nt started amica &amp; ripera\" (see\rthe fragment of his record above). A whole evening of doctor's deliberations on\rthe right antibiotics to prescribe is summarized in this last sentence. And the\reight days between reinfusion and last night flash by uneven\n\n\ntfully, only to\rslow down \"last night\", and to stop in the present, where the search for the\r\"origin\" of the fever is the order of the day. Time loops and swirls in these\rreconstructions: post hoc rationalizations after a sequence of dispersed\roccurrences\n\n\n become prior reasons for a \"decision\", and episodes get condensed,\rstretched and rearranged. Although the progress notes do sometimes tie the\rhistories evolving in different sections of the record together, they produce a\rhistory which is non-linear, con\n\n\nstantly rewritten, and constantly emergent.<p>\r\tThere is, then, no simple mapping between these histories. Mr. Wood's record\rportrays an array of histories, which do not fold into one another to produce\rone overall history of a medical body. Rather, the d\n\n\nifferent histories\rco-exist, self-contained, sometimes touching and interlinked, but often going\rtheir own way. The record performs <i>multiple</i> histories: a series of\rparallel trajectories, through parallel but also often disconnected time-zones,\rand \n\n\na series of statements in which a integrative, historical narrative\rconstantly rewrites itself.<p>\r\tThe multiplicity of the patient performed by the medical record is prominent\rwhen we look at the patient's geography. Juxtaposing the different parts of th\n\n\ne\rrecord does not provide an evenly distributed, three dimensional map of the\rbody. The travel through bodily space is discontinuous, and filled with\rindeterminacy. The different sections all stand for a series of probes (the\rblood tests, the radiographic\n\n\n procedures, the physical examination) that are\rlet down into body that, in Foucault's felicitous phrase, hides its inner\rpathological truth as long as it remains in the \"night of life\" (1973, p. 165).\rDifferent sections perform different geographies: som\n\n\ne organ systems are lumped\rtogether in one, and separated in other parts. The blood test forms\rmeticulously separate different cell types, which are lumped together in the\rfluid loss forms (all under the category \"blood\"). The bacteriological forms\rdistin\n\n\nguish different sites from which cultures are taken: the urine, the\rblood, the throat, the prepuce, the feces. The X-ray reports speak about the\rthorax (including the lungs, the heart) and the abdomen (including liver,\rspleen, pancreas, and so forth). And\n\n\n sometimes different geographies are\rperformed on one form: the \"organ systems\" listed on the intensive care's\rphysical examination form (see above), for instance, mapped out regions (the\rabdomen, the extremities), functional systems (cardial, pulmonal, c\n\n\nentral\rnervous system) as well as an overall \"others\" category (general\rimpressions).<p>\r\tHere as well, the different geographies do not unequivocally fold into one\rbiomedical body. There are spaces that remain empty, and there are spaces that\rare filled \n\n\nwith competing tales. A differentiation in \"regions\" cross-sects a\rdifferentiation in \"fluids\" (blood, urine), which cross-cuts a differentiation\rin \"functional systems\"; some \"functional systems\" might be grouped in one\r\"region\", while others (e.g. the c\n\n\nardio-vascular system, or the nervous system)\rmight not. How are these related? How is what is seen on the X-thorax related\rto the \"cardial system\" as felt and heard during the physical examination? Does\rfluid loss through blood loss result in a loss of e\n\n\nquivalent amounts of the\rdifferent blood cell types, or does bleeding result in a depletion of some\rcells more than others? As above, these links are not self-evident. They may be\rcreated, in the record, through an explicit juxtaposition and interpretatio\n\n\nn of\rthese observations in the progress notes, or through additional examinations (a\rmore frequently repeated series of blood tests, for example). The point is that\rthese links are often not made; that they are absent, thus leaving the\rgeographies in thei\n\n\nr unconnected realms (Mol forthcoming). And when such\rattempts are made, the geographies may well contradict each other. The blood\rmight seem infected according to the changing ratio in blood cell types, but\rnot according to the bacterial examination of t\n\n\nhe blood; while the physical\rexamination may carve out lungs that are \"clean\", an X-ray may simultaneously\rshow lungs that are \"massively infiltrated\". Again, the record does not contain\rmechanisms for preventing such gaps and conflicts. It performs multi\n\n\nple\rgeographies, sometimes linked, sometimes oblivious to one another, sometimes\rconflicting.<p>\r<b></b><p>\r<b></b><p>\r<b>MULTIPLE BODIES POLITIC</b><p>\r<b></b><p>\r<b></b>\tThe record is not only crucial for the planning of interventions and\rthe coordinati\n\n\non and interaction between care providers. Other parties are also\rhighly interested in the record. Insurance companies want more information\rabout the indications for interventions, researchers want data on the\rprevalence of combinations of symptoms and t\n\n\nhe efficacy of therapies, and\rgovernments and hospital boards want to know how many days patients of a\rspecific diagnostic category are hospitalized - and for what reasons. All these\rparties claim that the patient record can deliver the information they r\n\n\nequire\r(see e.g.<i> </i>Ball and Collen 1992). In these discussions, the record is\roften portrayed as a \"repository of information\" (Dick and Steen 1991), as a\rvast treasure of facts which only needs to be tapped into. In such a view, the\rbuilding blocks,\n\n\n the \"facts\", can only be more or less \"adequate\" and\r\"complete\".<p>\r\tOne dream of an electronic medical record from the 1970s was that such a\rrecord would provide an unmediated picture of doctors' thought, and produce an\runtainted, complete, error-free d\n\n\nocument: <p>\r<p>\rTo put a secretary or a computer technician between the physician and the\rcomputer is defeating the purpose of a direct natural language\rphysician-computer conversation. If a girl has to interpret what you have said\rand then put this in s\n\n\nome form that she thinks the computer will understand, I\rthink we increase the error rate. More important, you prevent the physician\rfrom <i>talking</i> to the computer. When the technology becomes sophisticated\renough and the expense becomes low enough t\n\n\nhat the physician-computer interface\rshould be direct and in a natural language, there should be no girl, no mark\rsense card, no keyboard or any other type of artificial instrument between him\rand his computer. This is why a light pen was devised. It look\n\n\ns like a pencil,\rit has the physical form of a pencil. The physician has been using the same\rinstrument since he was three years old. (Anderson and Forsythe, 1970, p. 257)\r<p>\r<p>\rCurrent, \"paper\" medical records are harshly criticized precisely for not\rp\n\n\nroperly reflecting what has happened, and what physicians think: <p>\r<p>\rThe medical record is an abomination. ... It is a disgrace to the profession\rthat created it. More often than not, the chart is thick, tattered,\rdisorganized, and illegible; progress\n\n\n notes, consultant's notes, radiology\rreports, and nurses notes are all co-mingled in accession sequence. The charts\rconfuse rather than enlighten; they provide a forbidding challenge to anyone\rwho tries to understand what is happening to a patient (Bleic\n\n\nh 1993).<p>\r<p>\r\tThe dream of the unmediated record dates from the earliest medical computing\rapplications such as MUMPS (Barnett, 1975)<i> - </i>and has of course never\rbeen realized. There are many steps between \"what happened\" and the final\rrecord of t\n\n\nhese events: the summarizing processes described, but also the often\rinvisible but crucial pool of typists who transform the physicians' taped\rreports into legible, grammatically correct and understandable reports. And\rmost medical records work in hospita\n\n\nls is actually done by the equally\rinvisible yet crucial medical records professionals - there are some fifty\rschools in the States training people for bachelor's degrees in Medical Records\rAdministration (Huffman 1990, p. 53). Such professionals signific\n\n\nantly change\raspects of the record. For example, Ann Fagot-Largeault (1989, pp. 139-140)\rtraces the mediation process for French death certificates. She cites cases\rwhere, like doctors, coders (who take the medical history and apply it to the\rdeath certif\n\n\nicate) have their own favorite codes - leading to an \"epidemic\" of\r\"diffuse intravascular coagulation\" in the 1970s (p. 145). These mediations add\rup: she cites a study from 1970 in Stockholm, where it was shown that the final\rcause of death was wrong (as\n\n\n demonstrated by autopsy; itself of course a\rspecific mediation) in 45% of cases for \"probable\" causes of death and in 25%\rof \"certain\" causes... (p. 145). It is estimated in France that about one in\rfour certificates filled in by doctors need to be \"re-i\n\n\nnterpreted\"; with\rdoctors agreeing with the coder's choice only between \n80% and 95% of the time\r(p. 218).<a href=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">7</a>\r\tThe \nimage of the record as a more or less adequate representation of facts and\revents is also problematic since, a\n\n\ns we have seen, the record feeds into the\rvery constitution of these facts and events. We have seen how the record\rcontains many emergent stories about the patient's body: both its temporality\rand geography. Any one implementation of the record actualizes\n\n\n one type of\rstory; and a set of implementations employing a standardized story format (it\ris easier to tell some stories than others in the record) inscribes its\rspecific time and space in the patient's body. In this section, we shall see\rthat the same a\n\n\nnalysis can be made of the organizational work done by the\rmedical record.<p>\rWhat do medical records record? The record traces what Strauss and his\rco-workers have called the \"illness trajectory\": the course of the illness, the\rtotal organization of work\n\n\n done over that period and the impact of that work on\rthose involved (1985, p. 8). In this section, we will take one cut through this\rtotality, arguing that medical records always describe past action in the\rcontext of a set of organizational arrangements\n\n\n. It would be meaningless to\rcite a temperature reading from a record out of the context of what that\rreading entailed organizationally - a high reading in this kind of chart at\rthis point entrains this kind of response, and so forth. The medical record o\n\n\nf\rits nature only exists within a certain organizational context: as do all\rrecords of past action. But it at the same time feeds into the reproduction of\rthese organizational contexts: the act of recording both enacts the\rorganization that deals with the\n\n\n phenomenon and creates the past within which\rthe phenomenon has occurred. Medical records produce a series of well-defined\rnarrative structures; each of which reflects and produces a particular kind of\rsocial organization. We want to look at some of thes\n\n\ne structures to elaborate\rhow the record is involved in the reflection and production of different body\rpolitics; how the records are involved in the very production of the\rdescriptions under which they function.8 Here as well as above, the crucial\robserv\n\n\nation is that the stories the record produces are not mere<i>representations</i> of the work - they are a core, constituent\r<i>part</i> of it.<i> </i>We will concentrate on three dimensions of the\rorganizational life of medicine in turn: institution\n\n\nal (legal and insurance\rarrangements), work practice (the organization of the clinic) and processes of\rprofessionalization (nursing); at each point we shall be concerned with the\rdeployment of medical records in building a \"body politic\".<a\rhref=\"record_f\n\n\nn.html#fn0\">[9]</a> Finally, we will - making the same move as in\rthe previous section - discuss the question of multiplicity: how one\rinfrastructural form (the medical record) can produce a range of configurations\rof these bodies politic.<i></i><p>\r<i></\n\n\ni><p>\r<i></i><p>\r<i>The body of the law</i></i><p>\tThe medical record is \none of \nthe records that produces the legal entity the\rcitizen-in-the-state (Ewald 1986). In order for the record to work, the object\rof the story has to be a registered entity (the \n\n\nneed for registration often\rbeing the need for medical attention). Here as elsewhere the primary issue is\rnot whether the records tells a \"true\" story; though in this case the act of\rregistering in a sense makes it so - it is constitutive of citizenship.H\n\n\nutchins (1995) reminds us of this in the case of navigation: the primary\rmotive for the rich set of records kept by every ship is that the captain needs\rto be able to show, in case of accident, that everything possible was done.<a\rhref=\"record_fn.html#fn0\n\n\n\">[10]</a> And in a textbook on medical records, the\rfirst thing that is said about medical data entry is that these \"formulate a\rlegal document that demonstrates the following:<p>\r*\tthe patient has a need for service<p>\r*\tthe correct service is provided<\n\n\np>\r*\tthe service is provided in the proper manner by the proper person\". (Waters\rand Murphy 1979, p. 54).<p>\rIn current medical work, this legal story is simultaneously the story produced\rfor the insurance companies' interest: it legitimates the actions p\n\n\nerformed as\rwell as their costs. These are particular kind of stories: the legal record\rshould not contain inconsistencies or lacunae (Bowker 1994). It should not\rrefer to things which \"just happened\". Everything has to be explicable and\rjustifiable. If t\n\n\nhe patient died it was despite the full operation of due\rprocess; if a test was performed it was because there was a clear-cut medical\rindication. The <i>outcome</i> of the legal record (the moral of the story) is\rthe meta-affirmation that the medical sys\n\n\ntem is fully penetrated and\runderwritten by the legal system: that the doctors did everything that they\rcould be expected to, and that all these affirmations were just. <p>\r\tTypically, these \"preferred\" accounts centralize the physician's agency as\rcore d\n\n\necision maker, and reduce the role of the nurse to the provision of\rprimary data and the execution of the doctor's plans. Although nurses spend far\rmore time with the patient, their presence in the medical record is limited to\rfilling in the temperature l\n\n\nist; whilst the final story emphasizes the logical\rwork (rational reconstruction) of physicians, who are geographically much more\rremoved from the patient. The story that is told over and over again is that\rpatients are cured by doctors' actions; and that\n\n\n doctors' actions reflect a\rrational thought process. In producing these stories about doctors as heroes\rand patients as objects, the record configures chains of delegation that render\rthe doctor the representative of the entire heterogeneous assembly com\n\n\nprising\rthe hospital. S/he is performed as the head of the organizational work\rcomprising the crafting of the patient's body, which is done according to the\rlogic of textbook science. This \"repository of information\", in other words,\rembodies a differenti\n\n\nal evaluation of whose time counts, whose information\rmatters, and whose work deserves to be mentioned and made visible (Egger and\rWagner 1993; Frankenberg 1992; Star 1991).<a\rhref=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[11]</a><p>\r\tHow do these preferred accounts evolve? \n\n\nIt would be wrong to assume that\rmedical personnel \"lie\", or that there are \"cover ups\" going on somewhere.\rPreferred accounts emerge from the record only gradually, through small steps\rand reconstructions which by themselves are just ordinary moments in \n\n\nthe\rongoing work. The ordering and polishing of accounts is a natural process - it\ris a <i>prerequisite</i> for the smooth progression of complex, interactive\rwork processes (Garfinkel 1967).<p>\r\tOne of the active elements in the production of such accoun\n\n\nts is the medical\rrecord (Berg 1996). The records lead to a rational reconstruction of the past -\rjust the same kind of rational reconstruction that has been so successfully\rdeconstructed within science studies (see for example Latour and Woolgar 1986).\rT\n\n\nhe record is instrumental in producing such stories that tell \"rational\",\r\"textbook\" narratives about a patient entering a hospital with complaint X,\rbeing diagnosed with Y, treated with Z, and who was discharged with or died\rfrom Q. Its very forms are st\n\n\nructured towards such a sequence: the complaint\rshould be filled in first, then the diagnosis, and then the therapy. The forms\rsuggest the reasoning process which <i>should</i> have taken place: the\rconclusions are logically derived from the data gathered\n\n\n (Barrett 1988).<p>\r\tIn addition, the record is the very place where a public account of \"what has\rhappened\" is created. It is when writing into this potential source for\rretrospective inspection that physicians and nurses construe narratives that\ralign w\n\n\nhat actually happened with what should have happened - no matter how\rinsignificant these occurrences may seem (Garfinkel 1967, pp. 197-207; Hunter\r1991). If a patient has been hospitalized for several days, for example, nurses\rmay omit measuring the blood\n\n\n pressure and just fill in yesterday's measurement\rin today's column (see Figure 1). Likewise, residents often ask nurses what to\rprescribe while they complete the order form in the regular fashion: as if it\ris they who have told the nurses what to do (<i\n\n\n>cf.</i> Hughes 1988). The same\rphenomenon occurs in and through the summaries that are continually being\rproduced. In this process, details are omitted, and the story is simplified and\rretold in ways that fit the present situation at hand. This results i\n\n\nn an\rincreasing stylization of past events into a standard cannon: a sign leading to\ra diagnosis leading to a therapy leading to an outcome. A sentence like\r\"admitted with Hodgkin, now 8 days post-reinfusion\" effectively sets the focus\rof the current atte\n\n\nntion. Yet in doing so, it also smoothes over any diagnostic\runcertainties which might have played a role, deleting the deliberations that\rwent into the selection of this therapy and Mr. Wood's fears and anxieties.<p>\r\tFinally, all this adds to the peculi\n\n\nar feature of written text that once\rwritten, it tends to have a privileged position vis a vis other recollections\rof these events (see Clanchy, 1993 for the historical genesis of this\rprivilege). Wherever it travels (from the audit committee to the insur\n\n\nance\rinspector's desk to the court room), it becomes <i>the</i> trace to the\r\"original event\". As Smith aptly sums these issues up, accounts enter \"document\rtime\" once they are written: \"that crucial point at which much if not every\rtrace of what has gone\n\n\n into the making of that account is obliterated and what\rremains is only \nthe text which aims at being read as `what actually happened'\"\r(1974, p. \n260).<a href=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">12</a> Legal concerns are not the \nonly relevant cross-cutting interferenc\n\n\nes here: the\rfact that these documents are also (formally and informally) used for quality\rcontrol purposes and for the evaluation of colleagues and trainees yields\rsimilar consequences. And these are not new interferences: the first official,\rearly twent\n\n\nieth century attempts to standardize and improve medical record\rkeeping in the USA did not primarily derive from the urge to improve the\rprimary care process. Rather, they were driven by the absence of means to\rdecide upon certification and accreditation \n\n\nof hospitals and individual doctors\r(Stevens 1989; Waters and Murphy 1979, pp. 4-5). From early on, then, the\rrecord was a crucial element in the generation and reproduction of this complex\rbody politic.<p>\r<p><p>\r<i>The body politic of the clinic</\n\n\ni><p>\r<i></i><p>\r</i>\tAnalogous to its involvement in the production of a \npatient's body, the\rmedical record is involved in the production and reproduction of the body\rpolitic of the clinic. First, it plays a core role in the ongoing reproduction\rof the hospi\n\n\ntal's temporal structure. Triggering sequenced measurements\rproduces <i>both</i> a graph in a record and circumscribed, cyclical work tasks\rfor nurses. The unstructured progress notes forms require physicians to\rregularly summarize the current state of af\n\n\nfairs, and thus create an organizing\rstructure for their work days. Without the record's core role as a distributing\rand collecting device, the complex temporal organization of this body politic\rcould not exist. The record lists which actions are undertak\n\n\nen and which\ractions still to undertake, when which requests or interventions will yield\routcomes, and who is responsible for the completion of such a task. The flow\rsheet's medication and infusion lists, for example, function for both nurses\rand physicia\n\n\nns as a list of what has been administered, and as a means to see\rat a glance how some crucial measurements have been affected by these\rinterventions. In addition, they also organize the work: the ward secretary can\rsee what type of medication might need \n\n\nto be ordered, and nurses can see when\rto give what, and can subsequently add the infusion dosages for the calculation\rof the fluid balance. The record, in other words, affords a highly complex,\rtemporally distributed division of labor.<p>\r\tAnd it thereby\n\n\n also maps a complex geography of the hospital. The record\rdiscussed here is a so-called \"source-oriented\" record: by far the most common\rmeans of record keeping. It entails ordering the different sections in the\rrecord according to the different institut\n\n\nional sources the data are derived\rfrom: nursing notes, doctor's notes, laboratory results, bacteriology reports,\rconsultations of different specialties, and so forth.<a\rhref=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[13]</a> Again, this does not yield a map which\rmerely \"rep\n\n\nresents\": it feeds into the reproduction of these geographies.\rHaving their own forms and sections within the record, the nurses are separated\rfrom the physicians - both physically and intellectually. Notwithstanding other\ralliances or differences, the re\n\n\ncord clearly differentiates the bacteriologists\rvis-&agrave;-vis the radiologists, and sets them both apart, as two isolated\rgroups, from the specialists in charge.<p>\r\tThe record, moreover, feeds into the reproduction of the hierarchies between\rthese geo\n\n\ngraphical sections. The treating physicians are on top: they write the\rcentral pages of the record, defining the outlines of the illness trajectory\rand incorporating and summarizing information coming from all other sources.\rThey have unlimited access to \n\n\nall the sections, but only write there when the\roverall course is set. And the other sources are not equal either. Specialists\rcalled in for consultation will usually fill in their own, yellow consultation\rforms, but they are allowed to write their findin\n\n\ngs in the progress notes. No\rother discipline is allowed to do this. In addition, the hierarchy is evident\rin the way just how much a form is pre-structured. An unstructured forms leaves\rit to a named author to create order through the production of a nar\n\n\nrative, and\rit does not exert demands on the content of these narratives by listing\rpre-formatted labels - which may remain visibly empty. The physicians' progress\rnotes are totally unstructured, and the consultancy forms have a few, large\rsections with l\n\n\nabels such as \"findings, conclusions and advice\" - all designed\rfor free text. The radiographic reports are more brief, but the radiologist is\rfree to describe the image as s/he pleases, as long as it is followed by a\rconclusion which answers the treating\n\n\n physician's request. The bacteriologist,\rhowever, is limited to saying \"no growth\", \"a little growth\" or \"much growth\",\rand the laboratory workers and nurses can only produce the numbers which end up\rin the pre-formatted graphs and columns. As Hunter phr\n\n\nases it, \"the hierarchy\rof disciplines is very alive in the chart\" (1991, p. 88).<a\rhref=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">[14]</a><p>\r\tThe record not only plays a generative role in the organization of the clinic:\rit also legitimates this organization's design. As we\n\n\n have pointed at above,\rthe record tells the story of the <i>work</i> this body politic performs. One\rway of structuring the record has been to make every record a description of a\rworking organization operating at peak efficiency. Thus record keepers are\n\n\n\radvised that the purpose of the record is to tell a story that begins with\radmission, describes an every more precise diagnostic process, goes on to\rtreatment and ends with discharge - or, even more \"complete\" from the medical\rrecord keepers' perspective\n\n\n, death (Waters and Murphy 1979, p. 97). In this\rcase the outcome of the record is again the meta-affirmation that allopathic\rmedicine works - and, ipso facto, that the sites where medicine is performed\rwork. Every record - as individual as may be - is, t\n\n\nhrough its very form,\rtestament to this assertion.<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<i>The professional nursing body</i><p>\r<p>\r\tThe fact that the chart maps - and thus feeds into - the hierarchy of\rdisciplines in medical work has not gone unnoticed by these disciplines\rthemse\n\n\nlves. Turning to our third example, we encounter a professional group\rstriving to enhance its status through attempting to change these\rrecord-keeping practices. Here, the constitution of a body politic in and\rthrough the medical record has become a site \n\n\nof active contestation. The\rrecord-keeping practices at stake concern the nursing classification scheme\rdesigned for incorporation within hospital information systems. The scheme, NIC\r(Nursing Interventions Classification) divides up all of nursing work i\n\n\nnto a\rseries of well-defined actions which are then to be coded (allowing nursing\radministrators to track the work of their staff). The group at Iowa University\rSchool of Nursing published a first edition of their system in 1992, and a\rrevised and expande\n\n\nd version came out in 1996 (Cohen et al. 1991; McCloskey and\rBulechek 1996). <p>\r\tNIC itself is a fascinating system. Some categories, like \"Bleeding Reduction\r- Nasal - 4024\", are on the surface relatively obvious and codable into\rdiscrete units of work \n\n\npractice to be carried out on specific occasions. But\rwhat about the equally important categories of hope installation and humor?\r\"Hope Installation - 5310\" includes the subcategory of \"Avoid masking the\rtruth\". This is not so much something that nurses d\n\n\no on a regular basis, as\rsomething that they should not do constantly. It also includes: \"Help the\rpatient expand spiritual self\". Here the contribution that the nurse is making\ris to an implicit lifelong program of spiritual development. With respect to\"\n\n\nHumor - 5320\", the very definition of the category suggests the operation of a\rparadigm shift: \"Facilitating the patient to perceive, appreciate, and express\rwhat is funny, amusing, or ludicrous in order to establish relationships\"; and\rit is unclear how \n\n\nthis could ever be attached to a time line: it is something\rthe nurse should always do while doing other things. Further, contained within\rthe nursing classification is an anatomy of what it is to be humorous, and a\rtheory of what humor does. The recommen\n\n\nded procedures break humor down into\rsubelements. One should determine the types of humor appreciated by the\rpatient; determine the patient's typical response to humor (e.g. laughter or\rsmiles); select humorous materials that create moderate arousal for t\n\n\nhe\rindividual (for example picture a forbidding authority figure dressed only in\runderwear); encourage silliness and playfulness and so on to make a total of\rfifteen sub-activities: any one of which might be scientifically relevant. A\rfeature traditionall\n\n\ny attached to the personality of the nurse (being a\rcheerful and supportive person) is now attached through the classification to\rthe job description as an intervention which can be accounted for. These\rprocess categories fit into the same numbering schem\n\n\ne as more punctual\rcategories such as \"Bottle Feeding - 1052\" or \"Suturing - 3620\" - once in the\rrecord, there is no distinction between process and single interventions.<p>\r\tThe Iowa group (the kernel of whom are teachers of nursing administration)\rmade \n\n\nessentially three arguments for the creation of a nursing classification,\rinitially to nursing informaticians and thence to the hospital information\rsystems community. First, it was argued that without a standard language to\rdescribe nursing interventions\n\n\n, there would be no way of producing a scientific\rbody of knowledge about nursing. NIC in theory would be articulated with two\rother classification systems: NOC (the nursing sensitive patient outcomes\rclassification scheme) and NANDA (the nursing diagnosi\n\n\ns scheme). The three\rcould work together: one could perform studies over a set of hospitals\remploying the three schemes in order to check if a given category of patient\rresponded well to a given category of nursing intervention. Rather than this\rcomparati\n\n\nve work being done anecdotally as in the past through the accumulation\rof experience, it could be done scientifically through the conduct of\rexperiments. The second argument for classifying nursing interventions was that\rit was a key strategy for defendin\n\n\ng the professional autonomy of nursing. The\rIowa nurses are very aware of the literature on professionalization - notably\rSch&ouml;n (1983) - and are aware of the force of having an accepted body of\rscientific knowledge as their domain. The third argument\n\n\n was that nursing,\ralongside other medical professions, was moving into the new world of\rcomputers. As the representational medium changed, it was important to be able\rto talk about nursing in a language that computers could understand - else\rnursing work\n\n\n would not be represented at all in the future, and would risk\rbeing even further marginalized than it was at present. <p>\r\tThe intervention in turn can then be linked by nursing academics to nursing\routcomes in a series of clinical studies. The outcome o\n\n\nf the records will be\rthe integration of nursing work into the medical establishment . The expressed\rfear of professional leaders is that without representation in the information\rsystem, the profession of nursing will become ever more marginalized. So th\n\n\ne\rrecord is producing a patient - as we stressed in the first part of this work -\rbut it is also producing an organizational result. For the nurses, the record\rconstitutes, then, building blocks for a <i>body of knowledge, </i>which in\rturn loops back int\n\n\no the hierarchy. In current storage practices, nurses' notes\rare frequently separated from doctors' notes, and are often destroyed\rimmediately the patient leaves the hospital (Huffman 1990). A professionalized\rform of reporting would create a continuing r\n\n\necord of their activities - which\rcould feed into the discipline of \nnursing science and be used to unseat the\rcurrent hierarchy.<a \nhref=\"record_fn.html#fn0\">15</a>\tNurses who met to develop a \"nursing \nminimum data set\" (modeled on the\rsuccessful medical \n\n\nminimum data set) to be produced by all hospitals in their\rmedical records argued that: \"the most frequently focused upon language is that\rdeveloped by medicine and the numerous natural or physical sciences that\rcontribute to medicine's scientific knowled\n\n\nge base. This language is focused\rupon most frequently by nurses, because of medicine's long history of dominance\rin nursing, its relative specificity about physiological phenomena, its\rapparent measurability, and its familiarity. It is also valued for it\n\n\ns social\rstatus as a scientific language, used by a politically powerful professional\rgroup, physicians\" (Kritek, 1988, p. 25). It is not enough for nurses to\raccurately record what they do - they must record it in a language acceptable\rto physicians and \n\n\nhospital administrators, and productive of a new, higher\rstatus. For this reason, \"leech treatment\" was not initially recognized as a\rNIC category - even though it was indeed a treatment and was indeed carried out\rby a number of nurses (Neumann, forthcomi\n\n\nng). The nursing record had to be seen\rto be \"professional\" in order for it to do its work. That work is, in part, the\rmodeling of nursing on the example of medicine; itself modeled (with the help\rof the medical record, as we saw above) in the image of pu\n\n\nre\rscience.<i></i><p>\r<i></i><p>\r<p>\r<i>Multiplicity: Interoperability and Infrastructure</i><p>\r<i></i><p>\r\tIt is turning into a complex thing, our medical record. It produces multiple\rbodies and underwrites a number of ever-shifting organizational \n\n\nconfigurations.\rFor the nurses, the medical record is a crucial tool in their organizational\rstruggle for status at the same time as it is a record of what happened to the\rpatient, a legal document, and a tool which organizes their daily work. It must\rbe \n\n\nable to do all these jobs at once - and for all those working with it. In\rthe multiplicity of context the record is drawn into (and helps to constitute),\rmaterially different objects are at play: most physicians never get to see the\rcoding forms used by t\n\n\nhe coders; most record administration coders know little\rof the elaborate nursing coding schemes; most nurses primarily draw on the\rnursing record during their work, and so forth.<p>\r\tAs we have seen, medical records are involved in the production of mult\n\n\niple\rbodies politic. Consider the legal reading of the record that we have\rdiscussed. In this reading, the legal narrative is the chief concern, and some\rfeatures of the record are activated as relevant for the story to be properly\rtold. It may not matter\n\n\n for the nursing record whether or not a given\rtemperature reading was taken, but this may make a large difference legally (as\rindicative of contributory negligence). So medical records do not have to do a\rsingle job, they have to be configured in such a \n\n\nway that a set of different\rorganizations are serviced by them. To borrow the vocabulary of information\rscience they have to serve as <i>infrastructure </i>(Star and Ruhleder,\r1996)<i> </i>to a set of organizations. They have to do this in such a way that\n\n\n\rthese organizations can use the medical records in conjunction with other\rrecords that they generate. Thus for example you want the medical record to\rstore information about ethnicity in a way which makes sense to epidemiologists\rand to public health off\n\n\nicials - so that in turn these groups can deploy the\rrecords in conjunction with other records that they produce to track diseases.\rAgain to borrow the vocabulary of information science, we can say that the\rmedical record needs to guarantee <i>interoperab\n\n\nility</i>. In this section, we\rshall see that fashioning of medical records into infrastructural tools\rguaranteeing interoperability involves a series of organizational alignments of\rgreat political and ethical importance. Just as for the patients in thep\n\n\nrevious section above, there is a real <i>multiplicity</i> of organizations\rproduced by the records. Just as for the patients, this conflicts with a\rrhetoric of singularity (the convergence of traces on a single ideal patient\rtemporality and geography and\n\n\n on a single ideal organizational context).<p>\r\tA recent history of medical informatics notes that: \"... by the 1980s, the\rprovision of health care in the United States had three dimensions of\rintegration for patient care information: <i>local integration\n\n\n</i> of\rinformation in hospitals or in physicians' offices; <i>vertical integration</i>\rof information between affiliated hospitals and medical offices; and\r<i>horizontal integration </i>among associated hospitals, clinics, and\rcommunity health and welfar\n\n\ne support groups\" (Collen 1995, p. 82). Each of\rthese forms of integration (which cannot be as neatly separated off from each\rother as Collen implies) entail a different form of interoperability. The\rrecord has to be aligned with the needs of the organiza\n\n\ntions associated with\rthem. This involves, for one thing, matching of the different timetables and\rgeographies the records produce. Roth (1979) discusses the difficulty of a\rtuberculosis patient traveling to a new sanatorium without there being an\ragreed-\n\n\nupon language for describing the patient's condition; the NIC nurses\rdespair of ever producing nursing knowledge without comparability (Timmermans\ret al. forthcoming). But this integration also extends to relationships with\rhealth care providers, public h\n\n\nealth officials, the World Health Organization\r(which maintains the International Classification of Diseases), the legal\rprofession and so forth: as we have pointed out, the record is increasingly\rseen as a vital source for these \"third parties\" as well. \n\n\nWith the development\rof computer based records, a further dimension is introduced by the needs of\rthe programmers. Thus at a meeting discussing the development of the NIC\rclassification, for example, nursing informaticians protested the existence of\r\"nest\n\n\ned classifications\" within NIC - that is to say an intervention containing\ranother within it. They argued that this made for difficulties in programming\rthe appropriate screens on the electronic nursing record.<p>\r\tWith the extension of the record's reach\n\n\n through different times, spaces and\rinto novel domains, much work is done <i>on</i> the record to ensure that these\rmultiple configurations continue to be possible. Much of this work seems\r\"purely technical\"; appears far removed from organizational or po\n\n\nlitical\rissues. Consider the sets of committees that have been involved with\rstandardizing medical informatics:<p>\r<p>\rThe American Standard for Testing Materials (ASTM) subcommittee E31.12\rsubcommittee framed nomenclatures and medical records. In 1988, A\n\n\nSTM sub-co\rE31.12 published standards for patient discharge and transfer data. Health\rLevel Seven (HL7) an organization made up of vendors, hospitals and consultants\rwas organized in 1987 to develop interface standards for transmitting data\rbetween applic\n\n\nations that used different computers within HISs. The message\rcontent of HL7 was to conform to the International Standards Organization (ISO)\rstandards for the applications level 7 of the Open Systems Interconnection\r(OSI) model; the HL7 standard used the\n\n\n same message syntax, the same data types\rand some of the same segment definitions as ASTM. The Medical Data Interchange\r(MEDIX) P1157 committee of the IEEE, formed at the SCAMC 1987 was also\rdeveloping a set of standards, based on the ISO application-lev\n\n\nel standards,\rfor the transferring of clinical data over large networks from mixed sources,\rsuch as from a clinical lab and a pharmacy, for both intra- and interhospital\rcommunications. (Collen 1995, p. 109)<p>\r<p>\r\tEach of these interconnections was the \n\n\nproduct of a continuing effort to\rmaintain and stabilize an infrastructure. Janet Abbate (forthcoming) has\rdemonstrated how the OSI standards are themselves the fragile outcome of a\rseries of negotiations between a computing industry wanting to retain the\n\n\n\rproprietary edge of a closed system, government regulators, public pressure\rgroups and so forth. As you spiral down into the infrastructure you get beyond\ra particular database in a hospital to the technical standards (OSI)\runderwriting that database; an\n\n\nd as you follow OSI in development you witness a\rtitanic struggle between company interest and the public good being written in\rcode. This is typical for infrastructure: the \"harder\" you go, the\r<i>closer</i> you get to organizational and political concer\n\n\nns (see also\rHanseth et al. 1996, and see Carlson 1991 who makes this point brilliantly for\rinnovation in the electrical industry).<p>\r\tAll these standardization efforts do not do away with the continuing need to\rbalance the needs exerted within the diffe\n\n\nrent networks that interconnect\rthrough the infrastructure (Bowker and Star 1994; Timmermans and Berg 1997).\rThe ever unattainable ideal of pure, quantifiable knowledge remains a driving\rorganizing force - even when it is patently absurd. Consider the cas\n\n\ne of fluid\rbalance - this is precisely measured to the milliliter in intensive care units,\rand then a fudge factor out of all proportion to the data is added in for\rsweating (which cannot be so simply measured). Why is this ideal so successful\rin organizi\n\n\nng infrastructures and guaranteeing interoperability? One answer is\rthat it generates alignments. If we are all striving in the same direction\rthen, whether or not the direction itself is a good one, our sets of fudge\rfactors and uncertainties will tend t\n\n\no align with each other. An analogy here\rwould be to the story of the emperor's new clothes. If everyone seeks to\rdescribe the world in ways acceptable to the others around them, then the\remperor will be seen to well dressed - whether or not he is - if on\n\n\ne person is\rout of alignment, the whole may crumble. This, we would argue, is one reason\rwhy formal records entail such deep organizational discipline.<p>\r\tThe nurses producing NIC believe deeply that the current system of accounting\rinscribed in the hosp\n\n\nital information systems is wrong-headed. Thus in a June\r1995 meeting, co-leader of the NIC team JoAnne McCloskey mentioned the rise of\ractivity-based accounting, meaning that individual activities had to be costed.\rShe went on to effectively deconstruct \n\n\nthis in much the same vein as Dick\rBoland (1996) has done from within the field of Management and Information\rScience. Nurse practitioners, she noted, see patients for longer than doctors -\rsince they are teaching, and preventing re-occurrence etc. Until \n\n\nyou pull out\rproductivity against performance one cannot see this. This was also a problem,\rshe noted, for women physicians (who see patients longer, and need to see them\rless as a result - so on a productivity measure it looks like they are working\rmore \n\n\nslowly). However the productivity measures being used were based on the\rfactory measure of how many widgets an hour you produce. Crucially, she went on\rto say that: \"Nursing needs to speak the language used elsewhere. This is why\rwe need to use a restrict\n\n\ned definition of productivity\". In our terms, she is\rpointing to the need for interoperability of the nursing records with other\rmedical records. And indeed in the NIC email list she soon floated an attempt\rto pin times to interventions (difficult in the \n\n\ncase of emotional support and\ractive listening; but not obvious even for bowel incontinence care...). And\rindeed in order to speak the language of accountancy well enough to justify a\rnew nursing slot, the organization had to be recorded as having worked \n\n\nin a\rparticularly well defined set of temporal slots. Here is a sample argument that\ruses the assignation of time slots to NIC interventions to justify the creation\rof a new nursing position in a given hospital. This argment was presented to\rnursing admin\n\n\nistrators and nursing information specialists at the same\rmeeting:<p>\r<p>\r<u>Position justification</u><p>\rTeaching/ discussion/ process\t\t\ttime<p>\rindivid. teaching\t\t\t\t8<p>\rprescribed medic.\t\t\t\t15<p>\rprescribed procedure\t\t\t\t10<p>\rtreatment\t\t\t\t\t30<p>\r63 mi\n\n\nnutes by 620 new patients per year = 39,060 minutes or 651 hours.<p>\r651 hours divided by 2000 = .3 FTE. (FTE being \"full time equivalent\").<p>\r<p>\r\tWhat is happening here is that a key player in the production and maintenance\rof the medical record - the \n\n\nnurse - does not believe in the validity of the\rtraces that they are producing of their own work in the record; and yet they\rhave to both write records as if such traces were true and write them well\renough so that nursing should be seen to be a key playe\n\n\nr in the efficient\rscientific treatment of patients (rather than a prime candidate for cost\rcutting). What a strange irony! It is, we would argue, an extreme example of a\rvery common phenomenon.<i> </i>Consider the case discussed at length by Young\r(1995)\n\n\n and Kirk and Kutchins (1992) of psychoanalysts who in order to receive\rreimbursement for this procedures need to couch them in a biomedical language\rthat is anathema to them, but is the lingua franca of the medical insurance\rcompanies. The nurses have po\n\n\ntential allies - there are radical accountants,\rradical doctors, critical medical informaticians: but the need to align is\rimmediate; the risks of disappearing forever from the medical record too great\rto make the risk of challenging the common language w\n\n\northwhile. Local use of\rthe record underwrites organizational multiplicity (nurses will continue to be\rconcerned with process; psychoanalysts with the id) at the same time as the\rconstrained form of the record evokes a single large medical organization wi\n\n\nth\rguaranteed interoperability of its \"departments\" (nursing, epidemiology, public\rhealth, medical insurance and so forth) - just as the patient's body is at once\rconjured into a single time and space while remaining locally multiple. <p>\r\tInfrastructures\n\n\n underwrite alignment of the organizations that they are\rinfrastructural to; and a key feature of this alignment in the case of the\rmedical record is the evanescent ideal of the scientific operation of medicine.\rAs Latour (1988) has argued in an analysis \n\n\nof Pasteur, much of the power of\rscience comes from such alignment. This alignment is not ever completed or\rentirely successful: however large techno-economic networks cannot exist\rwithout it. The medical record produces organizations which can configure \n\n\ntheir\rown records such that a privileged set of stories (due process; medical\rscience; nursing efficiency) can be told again and again. <p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<b>Conclusion</b><p>\r<p>\r\tThe medical record, it has become clear, is a complex object, and a\rfascinating a\n\n\nnd crucial focus for sociological research. It feeds into that\rwhat it merely seems to represent; it is a crucial element in the constitution\rof the patient's body (inscribed in a set of spaces and times) and of the\rhospital as a formal organization (equa\n\n\nlly inscribed in a set of spaces and\rtimes). It is a site where both the constitution of the patient and the\rconstitution of the hospital worker is at work: the bodies and bodies politic\rthey inhabit are reinscribed into novel places, broken apart in new \n\n\nways, and\rconfigured into spaces and times out of their control. Seen in this light, as a\rsite where multiple stories about patients and about organizations are at stake\r(including the interoperability between these stories), the medical record\rbecomes hi\n\n\nghly relevant both analytically and politically. There is a strong\rcurrent \"push\", for example, towards the implementation of the electronic\rmedical record - and when the record is seen as an innocuous storage device,\rthe appropriate implementation is oft\n\n\nen seen as a \"technical problem\", or as a\rmatter of finding the \"appropriate interface\". When it is acknowledged that the\rmedical record is interwoven with the structure of medical work in fundamental\rways, that different medical record systems embody dif\n\n\nferent notions of how\rwork is organized, different modes of configuring patient bodies, and so forth,\rwe are in a position to better understand and intervene upon the issues that\rare at stake. We are reminded of Latour's (1987) observation that science is\n\n\n\rbureaucracy or Serres' equation of law and science (1987): the site of the\rcreation of organization and body is the bureaucratic work of creating\rinscriptions. To end where we began: this site thereby becomes a key site for\rthe arrogation and exercise of\n\n\n power.<p>\r<b>Notes</b><p>\r<b></b><p>\r<p>\r<b>Acknowledgements</b><p>\r<p>\rMarc Berg would like to thank the Dutch Association for Scientific Research\r(NWO) for making this research possible.
