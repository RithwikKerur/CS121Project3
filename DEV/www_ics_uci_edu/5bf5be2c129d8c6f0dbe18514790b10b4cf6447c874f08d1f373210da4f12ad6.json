Bowker<p>\rGraduate School of Library and Information Science<p>\rUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<i></i><p>\r<i></i><p>\r<i>Introduction - Well do I remember...</i><p>\r\"I remember that I had a typical English grammar school education from ages\r11-14, after which time the family emigrated to Australia\".  This is a kind of\rreminiscence we can all relate to, but it is clearly problematic, in my case,\rwith respect to the issue of the truth about the past.  It is a memory laden\rwith my present understanding of the category `English education', which feeds\rpartly at least off the film <i>If </i> about English private schooling, and so\rwhich `should' not be relevant.  Furthermore, I saw the film some years after I\rleft England and school both.  So the framework that contains, in some sense,\rmy memories of what it was like in those years could not possibly have existed\rat the time that I experienced them.  It may still be a valid and useful\rframework; however it almost certainly helps me to remember some parts of my\rlife (which make me like Malcolm MacDowell in the film) and forget others (less\rheroic and less nihilistic).<p>\r<p>\rRecall is in general a problematic concept, even when we can assume that people\rare trying to tell the truth about the past.  Studies of people's intensely\rremembered `flashbulb memories' (what were you doing at the time that Kennedy\rwas assassinated) have proved them to be often false (Brown and Kulik, 1982).\rJohn Dean claimed fairly total recall at the time of Watergate - but as Ulric\rNeisser points out through analysis of the tapes made in the Oval Office he\rremembered neither conversations, nor even gists of conversations - but rather\ran ideal set of possible conversations which encoded his perceived truth of the\rsituation and his fantasies about his own role therein (Neisser, 1982; but see\rthe excellent critique in Edwards and Potter, 1992<a\rhref=\"forget_fn.html#fn0\">1</a>).  People cannot remember accurately how they felt\rin the past: they take the present as a benchmark and then work from a\rcurrently held belief about change or stability in their attitudes: thus when\rasked how you felt six months ago about, say, a TV series, your memory will\rnecessarily be colored by what has happened since in that series (Linton,\r1982).  If all history is history of the present, then one might surely think\rof memory as ineluctably a construction of the present.  These studies from\rcognitive science suggest that truth or falsity is not a simple concept when it\rcomes to analyzing organizational memory in science or elsewhere (cf Hacking,\r1995, Chapter 17 - on the indeterminacy of the past).  Thus Bannon and Kuutti,\r1996 stress that if ]</a>`organizational memory' is at all a useful concept, it\ris so to the extent that it refers to active remembering which carries with it\rits own context - so that it comes in the form not of true or false facts but\rof multifaceted stories open to interpretation.  <p>\r<p>\rNeisser (1982), building on Tulving's famous distinction between episodic and\rsemantic memory (remembering what vs remembering how) introduces a third kind\rof memory - `repisodic memory' (remembering what was <i>really </i>happening).\rAgainst this increasing differentiation and specialization in the concept of\rmemory, we find a single and undifferentiated definition of `forgetting' - it\ris `not remembering'.  Further, forgetting in all its guises has frequently\rbeen seen as necessarily a problem.  Freud encouraged the recall of suppressed\rmemories (see Hacking, 1995 for a discussion of memory and veracity in Freud).\rHistorians insist that we must learn the lessons of the past.  Yrjo Engestrom,\rin his memorable paper on `organizational forgetting' (1988) discusses problems\rraised by the ways in which doctors forget; though his activity theoretical\rperspective on the organic links between internal and external memory traces is\rparticularly fruitful in that it provides a model for ethnographic studies of\rcollective memory.  Bitner and Garfinkel (1967) are among the few to observe\rand describe an ecology of forgetting, in their account of `good'\rorganizational reasons for `bad' clinical records'.<p>\r<p>\rTotal recall, in individuals or organizations, is neither desirable nor\rpossible.  Recent work in organizational theory has suggested that perhaps it\ris good on occasion to forget everything about the past, in order to start over\rwithout being trapped in old routines (Wackers, 1995).   There are indeed\rseveral good reasons for organizations to forget things about their own past.\rFirst, it might be the case that rediscovery is easier than remembering,\respecially where the overhead of constructing a sufficiently precise archive so\rthat a fine-grained situation can be remembered is high.  Thus in order to\rremember down to the level of detail that the English employees might not\runderstand `z' when pronounced `zee' one would need an immense archive surely\runnecessary for a telephone company but perhaps vital for a nuclear power plant\rwhere quick interpretation of a loudspeaker broadcast of `Z-Alpha-One' might\rhave safety consequences.  Secondly, extending Chandler (1977), one can see the\rdevelopment of statistics as a filtering mechanism that allows a central office\rnot to have to remember everything about a company's day to day running in\rorder to make things run smoothly: the filtering works as proactive forgetting.\rA third positive mode of forgetting is when an organization wants to change its\ridentity.  In such a case the argument that `we have always done things this\rway' stands in the way of breaking new ground.  Hughes (1989 [1883]) described\rthe change at Rugby school under Arnold in this light, showing Arnold\rimperceptibly changing the way things were done in such a way that group memory\rwas never mobilized against the changes.  In general, if  memory is being used\ras a tool of reification or projection then it can have harmful consequences.<p>\r<p>\rThis paper is about how organizations forget things selectively about the past\rin the process of producing knowledge. I shall argue that there are two major\rkinds of organizational forgetting in the process of producing and then\rmaintaining classification systems in the workplace:<p>\r<li>\tclearance - the erection of a barrier in the past at a certain point so that\rno information or knowledge can leak through to the present;</li><p>\r<li>erasure - the ongoing destruction of selective traces in the present.</li><p>\rI shall then argue that the classification systems which are created permit the\rorganization to move from heterogeneous forms of memory operating within\rmultiple frameworks to the privileging  of a form of memory (potential memory)\roperating within a well-defined information infrastructure subtended by\rclassification systems.  I shall demonstrate that in this process, the decision\rof whether to opt in to an infrastructure, with its attendant memory frames and\rmodes of forgetting, or to stay out of it, is of great political and ethical\rimport .  I shall firstly follow this set of arguments through with respect to\ra case study of the development of a classification of nursing work, and will\rthen broaden the discussion out to more general considerations of\rclassification and memory.<p>\r<p>\r<i>Part 1 - Nursing classifications and organizational forgetting</i><p>\rThe common thread for this part will be an analysis of the ways in which a\rnursing group in Iowa city is classifying nursing work. Nursing is particularly\rinteresting with respect to forgetting, since nursing work has traditionally\rbeen invisible and removed at the earliest opportunity from the medical record.\r In the 1988, a group was formed in the College of Nursing at the University of\rIowa to create what they call a Nursing Interventions Classification -\rhenceforth NIC (McCloskey and Bulechek, 1996), see Diagram 1 and Diagram 2.\rThere was already in place a somewhat badly maintained classification system\rfor nursing diagnoses (which is to say what specific nursing needs a given\rpatient had); but there was no standardized language for describing what it was\rthat nurses did.   The group published a first edition of their system in 1992,\rand a revised and expanded version came out in 1996.<p>\r<p>\rIn general, nursing has not been able as an institution to draw on an active\rmemory.  Rather, nursing has been seen as an intermediary profession that does\rnot need to leave a trace.  As nursing informatician Castles notes, citing\rHuffman on medical records management: Athe nursing records are the first to be\rpurged from the patient records; there is thus no lasting documentation of\rnursing diagnoses or nursing interventions and no method of storage and\rretrieval of nursing data. (Castles, 1981, p.42)<p>\r<p>\rNIC itself is a fascinating system.  Those of us studying it see it as an\rethnomethodological nirvana.  Some categories, like bleeding reduction - nasal,\rare on the surface relatively obvious and codable into discrete units of work\rpractice to be carried out on specific occasions.  But what about the equally\rimportant categories of hope installation and humor (see Diagram 3)?  Hope\rinstallation includes the subcategory of `Avoid masking the truth'. This is not\rso much something that nurses do on a regular basis, as something that they\rshould not do constantly.  It also includes: `Help the patient expand spiritual\rself'.  Here the contribution that the nurse is making is to an implicit\rlifelong program of spiritual development. With respect to humor, the very\rdefinition of the category suggests the operation of a paradigm shift:\r\"Facilitating the patient to perceive, appreciate, and express what is funny,\ramusing, or ludicrous in order to establish relationships\"; and it is\runclear how this could ever be attached to a time line: it is something the\rnurse should always do while doing other things.  Further, contained within the\rnursing classification is an anatomy of what it is to be humorous, and a theory\rof what humor does.    The recommended procedures break humor down into\rsubelements.   One should determine the types of humor appreciated by the\rpatient; determine the patient's typical response to humor (e.g. laughter or\rsmiles); select humorous materials that create moderate arousal for the\rindividual  (for example `picture a forbidding authority figure dressed only in\runderwear'); encourage silliness and playfulness and so on to make a total of\rfifteen sub-activities: any one of which might be scientifically relevant.  A\rfeature traditionally attached to the personality of the nurse (being a\rcheerful and supportive person) is now attached through the classification to\rthe job description as an intervention which can be accounted for.<p>\r<p>\rThe Iowa group, the kernel of whom were teachers of nursing administration,\rmade essentially three arguments for the creation of a nursing classification.\rFirst, it was argued that without a standard language to describe nursing\rinterventions, there would be no way of producing a scientific body of\rknowledge about nursing.  NIC in theory would be articulated with two other\rclassification systems: NOC (the nursing sensitive patient outcomes\rclassification scheme) and NANDA (the nursing diagnosis scheme).  The three\rcould work together thusly.  One could perform studies over a set of hospitals\remploying the three schemes in order to check if a given category of patient\rresponded well to a given category of nursing intervention.  Rather than this\rcomparative work being done anecdotally as in the past through the accumulation\rof experience, it could be done scientifically through the conduct of\rexperiments.  The Iowa Intervention project made up a jingle: NANDA, NIC and\rNOC to the tune of Hickory, Dickory, Dock to stress this interrelationship of\rthe three schemes.  The second argument for classifying nursing interventions\rwas that it was a key strategy for defending the professional autonomy of\rnursing.  The Iowa nurses are very aware of the literature on\rprofessionalization - notably Schon (1983) - and are aware of the force of\rhaving an accepted body of scientific knowledge as their domain.  (Indeed\rAndrew Abbott, taking as his central case the professionalization of medicine,\rmakes this one of his key attributes of a profession.)  The third argument was\rthat nursing, alongside other medical professions, was moving into the new\rworld of computers.  As the representational medium changed, it was important\rto be able to talk about nursing in a language that computers could understand\r(see Diagram 4) - else nursing work would not be represented at all in the\rfuture, and would risk being even further marginalized than it was at present.\r<i></i><p>\r<i></i><p>\r<i>Forgetting 1 - Clearance</i><p>\r<i>Grand Historiographer, Sima Qin (1994 [ca 100BC]), writing of the burning of\rthe books in 213BC, notes that the Chief Minister advised the emperor that:\rAall who possess literature such as the Songs, the Documents, and the sayings\rof the hundred schools should get rid of it without penalty.  If they have not\rgot rid of it a full thirty days after the order has reached them, they should\rbe branded and sent to do forced labor on the walls.  there should be exemption\rfor books concerned with medicine, pharmacy, divination by tortoise-shell and\rmilfoil, the sowing of crops, and the planting of trees (31).  In response to\rthis, the Emperor ordered the famous burning of the books - to cite Qin: Athe\rFirst Emperor collected up and got rid of the Songs, the Documents, and the\rsayings of the hundred schools in order to make the people stupid and ensure\rthat in all under Heaven there should be no rejection of the present by using\rthe past.  The clarification of laws and regulations and the settling of\rstatutes and ordinances all stared with the First Emperor.  He standardized\rdocuments. (31).  </i><p>\r<p>\rThere was a primitive act of clearance in the establishment of NIC.  By\rclearance, I mean a complete wiping away of the past of nursing theory in order\rto start with a clean slate - much as the first cultivators burned the forest\rto create land suitable for tilling in ordered rows (I am drawing here on\rSerres' (1993) work on clearance and origins in geometry).  The nurses said\rthat until now there had been no nursing science and therefore there was no\rnursing knowledge to preserve.  There is, one nursing informatician ruefully\rnoted: AIt is recognized that in nursing, overshadowed as it is by the rubrics\rof medicine and religion, no nurse since Nightingale has had the recognized\rauthority to establish nomenclature or procedure by fiat.  There are no\runiversally accepted theories in nursing on which to base diagnoses, and, in\rfact, independent nursing functions have not yet gained universal acceptance by\rnurses or by members of other health professions\". (Castles, 1981, 40)\rNursing, it was argued, had until now been a profession without form; nothing\rcould be preserved.  There was no way of coding past knowledge and linking it\rto current practice  - it was noted at a conference to establish a standardized\rnursing minimum data set (information about nursing practice that would be\rcollected from every care facility) that: \"The lists of interventions for any\rone condition are long partially because nursing has a brief history as a\rprofession in the choosing of interventions and lacks information for\rdecision-making.  As a profession, nursing has failed to set priorities among\rinterventions; nurses are taught and believe they should do everything\rpossible\". (McCloskey and Bulechek, 1992, 79) <p>\r<p>\rIn the face of this view of the nurse as the inglorious other - doing\reverything that nobody else does - should all previous nursing knowledge be\rabandoned?  William Cody, in an open letter to the Iowa Intervention Team\rpublished in <u>Nursing Outlook</u> in 1995 charged that this was precisely\rwhat would follow from widespread adoption of NIC: AIt would appear that the\rnursing theorists who gave nursing its first academic leg to stand on, as it\rwere, are deliberately being frozen out.  I would like to ask Drs McCloskey and\rBulechek, Why is there no substantive discussion of nursing theory in your\rarticle?  How can you advocate standardizing 'the language of nursing' by\radopting the language of only one paradigm?  How do you envision the\rrelationship between the 'standardized' masses and those nurse scholars with\rdiffering views?  (Cody, 1995, 93).  The Project team responded that indeed\rclearance was an issue: Athe Iowa group contends that taxonomic development\rrepresents a radical shift in theory construction in which the grand conceptual\rmodels are not debated, but transcended. We believe that, as a scientific\rcommunity, nursing has moved to the point of abandoning the conceptual models\rof nursing theorists as forming the science base of the discipline (McCloskey,\rBulechek and Tripp-Reimer, 1995, 95).  <p>\r<p>\rIt is not just at the level of nursing theory that this act of clearance is\rseen as unsettling.  Practicing nurses implementing NIC at one of four test bed\rsites have complained that learning to use NIC together with the new computer\rsystem it is embedded in is like going to a foreign country where you have to\rspeak the language; and to make matters worse you have to go to a new country\revery day. More prosaically, they say that they feel they are going from being\rexperts to novices<a href=\"forget_fn.html#fn0\">[2]</a>\rThe argument was made that quite simply there has been no work done in the\rpast: AThe discipline of nursing has not yet constructed a cohesive body of\rscientific knowledge (Tripp-Reimer et al, 1996, p.2).   However, there is a\rcomplexity here that often arises in connection with the strategy of clearance.\rOne wants to be able to say that nurses <i>now</i> do something which is\rvaluable and adaptable to scientific principles; while at the same time\rmaintain that nurses have not yet (until the development of the classification\rsystem) been able to develop any nursing theory and thence any systematic,\rscientific improvement in practice.  This same article, on the dimensional\rstructure of nursing interventions, tackles this problem directly.\rTripp-Reimer argues that there must be a cycle of forgetting in the development\rof the new classification scheme. The article begins with a quote from Chung\rTzu: <p>\rThe purpose of a fish trap is to catch fish.  When the fish are caught, the\rtrap is forgotten.<p>\rThe purpose of a rabbit snare is to catch rabbits.  When the rabbits are\rcaught, the snare is forgotten.<p>\rThe purpose of words is to convey ideas.  When the ideas are grasped, the words\rare forgotten.<p>\rSeek those who have forgotten the words. (p.2)<p>\rIt is argued that the traditional grand theories had a Acertain limited utility\rbeyond their historical importance in that they provided a structure for\reducational programs.  However, in the field expert nurses soon `forgot' these\rwords and developed their own schemata to get at the deep structure of the\rnursing situation (there is indeed a reference to transformational grammar\rhere).  Now using NIC categories as a research tool, one could uncover the\rthree key dimensions of nursing work (the intensity, focus, and complexity of\rcare) - which experts always already new about, without there having been a\rnursing science.  Having passed through the purifying cycle of forgetting, one\rcould finally Abring intuitive clinical decision-making to a conscious level.\rThere is a double complexity to this cycle.  First is the fact that the first\rauthor, Toni Tripp-Reimer,  is a cultural anthropologist turned nursing\rinformatician well versed in Kuhn, Lakoff and others.  The organization that\rproduces NIC has to be broadly enough construed, on occasion, to include the\rcommunity of sociologists of science and linguistics, even though this\rinclusion may never be represented overtly in the records of the classification\rscheme.  (In passing, this can form a kind of organizational memory that can\rflip into forgetting - storing information in locations once within the network\rof an organization but now outside of it;  a variety of outsourcing gone sour).\rThe second is that it reflects a tension between what nurses already know and\rwhat the science of nursing will tell them.  The NIC team in general are\rclaiming both that nursing is already a science, and that it is one which has\rnot yet been formulated: they need to maintain the former in order to justify\rthe profession against current attacks, and the latter in order to justify\rtheir classification system, which when in place will protect it from future\rattacks.  One is reminded of Piaget's (1969) assertion that our earliest\rintuitions are of the relativistic nature of time, and that we need to unlearn\rour school lessons in order both to access the latest science and to get back\rin touch with our childhood insights.   The act of clearance is to take away\ruseless theory; then ethnographic work will uncover the true science (always\ralready there) which NIC can express.  The act of clearance, then, is not one\rof simple denial of the past - though complex historical narratives need to be\rconstructed in order to distinguish the two.<p>\r<p>\rI am not of course here accepting the position that such clearance leads to the\rcreation of true science - the issue of the validity or not of nursing\rknowledge is entirely orthogonal to my purpose. I am producing an anatomy of\rwhat it has meant in the case of nursing to create such a science - and I will\rargue later that this is not an accidental feature of their work, but can be\rseen as a core strategy over the centuries in the creation of sciences.   The\rstrategy itself provides a way of managing a past that threatens to grow out of\rcontrol: one can declare by fiat that the past is irrelevant to nursing science\r(while, in Tripp-Reimer's case validating the past as embodied in current best\rpractice) in the development of a classification scheme which will provide for\ra good ordering of memory in the future - so that nothing henceforth deemed\rvital will be lost.<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<i>Forgetting 2 - Erasure</i><p>\r<i>Donald Crowhurst went quietly mad on a round-the-world yachting race and lay\rbecalmed on the ocean developing a theory of the cosmic mind whilst at the same\rtime completing and radioing in an immaculate official log that had him winning\rthe race at a record pace.  Crowhurst's double log surfaces within his madness\ras contemplation on the nature of time: AThe Kingdom of God has an area\rmeasured in square hours.  It is a kingdom with all the time in the world - we\rhave used all the time available to us and must now seek an imaginary sort of\rtime' (Tomalin and Hall, 1970, 259).</i><p>\r<p>\rWith the strategy of clearance, we saw the complete wiping-clean of the slate\rso that a single origin for nursing science could be created and so that from\rthat point of origin nursing actions could be coded and remembered in an\rorganizationally and scientifically useful fashion.  A second mode of directed\rforgetting in organizations is erasure: the constant filtering out of\rinformation deemed not worthy of preserving for organization's future\rpurposes.<p>\r<p>\rThe selective  erasure of nursing records within hospital information systems\rhas been drastic.  As noted above, nursing records are the first destroyed when\ra patient is released: the hospital administration does not need them (nursing\ris lumped in with the price of the room); doctors consider them irrelevant to\rmedical research; and nursing theorists are not well enough entrenched to\rdemand their collection.  Huffman (1990, 319), in a standard textbook on\rmedical records management writes: <p>\rAs nurses' notes are primarily a means of communication between the physicians\rand nurses, they have served their most important function during the episode\rof care.  Therefore, to reduce the bulk and make medical records less\rcumbersome to handle, some hospitals remove the nurses' notes from record of\radult patients when medical record personnel assemble and check the medical\rrecord after discharge of the patient.  The nurses' notes are then filed in\rchronological order in some place less accessible than the current files until\rthe statute of limitations has expired, and they are destroyed.<p>\rTraditionally nurses have facilitated themselves out of the equation: though\rthey may not have an official trace of their own past, their duty is to\rremember for others.   In one of those vague but useful generalizations that\rcharacterize information statistics, it was asserted, in a book on\rnext-generation nursing information systems, that 24 percent of total hospital\roperating costs were devoted to information handling.  Nursing, it is stated, A\raccounted for most of the information handling costs (28 percent to 34 percent\rof nurses' time); and what is worse, Ain recent years, external regulatory\rfactors, plus increasing organizational and health care complexity, have\raugmented the central position of information in the health care environment.\"\r(Zielstorff et al., 1993, 5) The nursing profession acts as a distributed\rmemory system for doctors and hospital administrators but in so doing is denied\rits own official memory.<p>\r<p>\rEven when the erasure is not mandated, it has been voluntary.  One text on a\rnursing classification system cites as a motif of the profession an observation\rthat: A'The subject of record-keeping has probably never been discussed at a\rconvention without some agitated nurse arising to ask if she is expected to\rneglect her patients in order to write down information about them. ....'\r(Martin and Scheet, 1992, 21 - echoing a 1917 source).  And Joanne McCloskey,\rone of the two principal architects of NIC notes that: A...the most convincing\rargument against nursing service or Kardex care plans is the absence of them.\rAlthough written care plans are a requirement by the Joint Commission for\rHospital Accreditation and a condition for participation in Medicare, few plans\rare, in fact, written.  (McCloskey, 1981, 120).   In her magisterial study of\rthe International Classification of Diseases, Ann Fagot-Largeault (1989) notes\rthe same reluctance on the part of doctors to spend time accurately filling in\ra death certificate (itself a central tool for epidemiologists) when they might\rbe helping live patients.  Thus there is, in Engestrom's (1988) terms, a block\rbetween internal memory and external memory: because representational work\rtakes time, the form fillers systematically erase complex representations that\rthey hold in their heads in favor of summary ones - in the case of the ICD\rthere are many complaints because of the overuse of general disease terms or\r`other' categories; in the case of a computerized NIC, nurses are suspected by\rthe NIC implementation team of using the choices that appear before them on a\rscreen (which they can elect with a light pen) rather than searching through\rthe system for the apt descriptor.<p>\r<p>\rOne of the main problems that the nurses have is that they are trying to\rsituate their activity visibly within an informational world which has both\rfactored them out of the equation and maintained that they should be so\rfactored - since what nurses do can be defined precisely as that which is not\rmeasurable, finite, packaged, accountable.  In nursing theorist Jenkins' terms:\rANurses have functioned in the post-World War II era as the humanistic\rcounterbalance to an increasingly technology-driven medical profession\r(Jenkins, 1988, 92).  They have tried to insert nursing as something that fits\rnaturally into a world partly defined by the erasure of nursing and other modes\rof invisible and articulation work - it is like technicians seeking new ways of\rwriting scientific papers so that their work gets acknowledged and yet the\rnature of scientific truth is not impeached.  Sometimes, as we will see, the\rnurses are driven by their logic to impeach medical truth; sometimes to\rchallenge orthodoxy in organization science; sometimes to restructure nursing\rso that these challenges will not be necessary.  At the end of the day there\rwill be an information infrastructure for medical work which contains an\raccount of nursing activity: the move to informational panoptica is\roverwhelming in this profession as in many others.  With projects like NIC,\rwhich offer new classification systems to embed in databases, tools, and\rreports we get to see what is at stake in making invisible work visible.<p>\r<p>\rI have in this section explored two strategies, clearance and erasure.  Some of\rthe points made here in the context of organizational forgetting relate to\rarguments within the sociology of science about the nature of scientific\rrepresentations of nature - notably deleting the work (Star, 1989, 1991;\rShapin, 1989),  and the deletion of modalities in the development of scientific\rtexts (Latour, 1987) -  that is to say the argument that as a scientific\rstatement gets ever closer to being accepted as fact, historical contingencies\rget progressively stripped from its enunciation.  Why, then, talk at all about\rmemory and forgetting when representation and its literature can do much of the\rsame work?  The concept of representation tends naturally to abstract away the\rongoing work of individual or organizational agents (compare here Woolgar,\r1995, 163).  It is difficult to express the fact that the representation can\rhave different meanings at different times and places in the organization in a\rlanguage which has been used rather to demonstrate the conjuring of a single\rarticulation of `fact'.  The act of remembering a fact organizationally\rinvolves not only mobilizing a set of black-boxed allies (in Latour's terms)\rbut also translating from the context of storage to the present situation (one\rmight store a fact for reason x but recall it for reason y).  Further, within\ran organizational context  it is easier to explore the distribution of memory\rand forgetting than the distribution of representation.  Finally, there it is\ralways a temptation when talking of representation to fall into a cognitivist\rtrap of assuming the primacy of the cognitive act.  By concentrating on\r`following the actors', sociologists of science have as a rule produced a\rlanguage which privileges the scientific `fact' and its circulation and which\rputs the infrastructure supporting that fact relatively into the background\r(what goes on inside the black box, or indeed what black boxes look like, is\rseen as irrelevant).  From the perspective of organizational memory, a modality\rcan be deleted in a number of different ways: it might be distributed (held in\ranother part of the organization than in that which produces the text); built\rinto the infrastructure (the work environment is changed such that the modality\ris never encountered); or simply dismissed.  Looking at ways of distributing\rmemory and operating forgetting we can, therefore, look in more fine-grained\rdetail at what happens as the representation  moves into and out of\rcirculation.<p>\r<p>\rClearance is a strategy employed internally within the profession of nursing as\ra tool for providing an origin for the science of nursing; erasure is employed\rexternally on the profession of nursing as a tool for rendering nursing a\rtransparent distributed memory system.  The logic of the relationship between\rclearance and erasure has been that the nurses are operating the clearance of\rtheir own past in order to combat the erasure of their present in the records\rof medical organizations.  Medical information systems, they argue, should\rrepresent the profession of nursing as if it just began yesterday - for\rotherwise they will copy the transparency of nursing activity from one\rrepresentational space (the hospital floor and paper archives) to another (the\relectronic record).  This poses, then, the question of what happens when a new\recology of attention (what can be forgotten and what should be remembered) is\rinaugurated with the development of a new information infrastructure.<p>\r<p>\r<i>Forgetting, classification and potential memory</i><p>\r<i>James Fentress and Chris Wickham (1992, 13), in a work reminiscent of\rFrances Yates' (1966), argue that artificial memory systems went on the wane\rafter Descartes: AInstead of a search for the perfectly proportioned image\rcontaining the 'soul' of the knowledge to be remembered, the emphasis was on\rthe discovery of the right logical category.  The memory of this system of\rlogical categories and scientific causes would exempt the individual from the\rnecessity of remembering everything in detail. ... The problem of memorizing\rthe world, characteristic of the sixteenth century, evolved into the problem of\rclassifying it scientifically.</i><p>\r<p>\rMemory - individual and organizational - is in general filtered through a\rclassification system, which permits encoding of multiple bits of information\rabout the environment into a single coherent framework (see Schachter, 1996:\r98-133).  Edouard Clarap&Euml;de (who performed the initial notorious\rexperiment of having a stranger rush into the classroom, do something\routrageous, and then have students describe what happened) noted as early as\r1907 that: \"that the past - even of a simple event - was less a record than a\rsort of taxonomy.  Not perceptions, but categorization of familiar types was\rthe major function of memory\" (cited in Matsuda, 1996: 109).  <p>\r<p>\rAny information infrastructure to an organization - paper or electronic; formal\ror informal - claims by its nature to contain all and only the information that\ris needed for the smooth running of the organization.  Organizations frequently\rwant to know everything relevant about some past action.  For example if there\ris a black-out along in the West due to a tree falling in Idaho, an awful\ramount of information needs to be recalled in order for the connection to be\rmade.  Frequently, a prime function of record keeping in the organization is to\rkeep track of what is going on such that, should anyone ever want to know\r(auditors, a commission of inquiry and so forth) a complete reconstruction of\rthe state of the organization at a particular moment can be made.  For example\rHutchins (1995: 20) talks about the role of the logs kept by navy ships of all\rtheir movements: \"Aboard naval vessels  records are always kept -\rprimarily for reasons of safety, but also for purposes of accountability.\rShould there be a problem, the crew will be able to show exactly where the ship\rwas and what it was doing at the time of the mishap\".  However, in order for\rsomething to be remembered officially by an organization it must be recorded on\ra form; and forms necessarily impose classification systems (Berg and Bowker,\rforthcoming).  The reconstruction will not cover literally everything that was\rgoing on at a particular moment, but only things that fit into the\rorganization's accepted classification scheme of relevant events.  I shall\rrefer to the kind of memory that is encoded in an organization's files for the\rpurposes of a possible future reconstruction as `potential memory'.  I am using\rthe word `potential' to draw attention to the distributed, mediated nature of\rthe record: no one person remembers everything about a medical intervention;\rand generally it can be processed through an organization without ever having\rbeen recalled.  However, there is a possible need to recall any one\rintervention in huge detail: and the only way that the possible need can be met\ris through the construction of a classification system which allows for the\refficient pigeon-holing of facts.<p>\r<p>\rWithin the hospital, nursing work has been deemed irrelevant to any possible\rfuture reconstruction; it has been canonically invisible, in Star's (1991)\rterm.  The logic of NIC's advocators is that what has been excluded from the\rrepresentational space of medical practice should be included.  <p>\r<p>\rOperating within the space of erasure which is at once home for them and a\rthreat to their continued existence, the nurses in Iowa have thought long and\rhard about the politics and philosophy of classifying their activities such\rthat they fit into the hospital's potential memory.  They do not want to flip\rover from being completely invisible to being far too visible.  They have\rdecided to name, but not to name too much.  To this end they have adopted their\rown practice of continuing partial erasure (where <i>they</i> limit the nature\rand scope of erasure) - for three reasons:<p>\rThey have decided to specify uniquely down to the level of interventions, but\rto leave the sub-categories of activities as relatively fluid - several\rpossibly contradictory activities are subsumed under a single intervention (see\rDiagram 3).  This allows, they argue, for a recognition of local differences\rand local autonomy (so central to the nursing self-image) whilst providing the\rnecessary degree of specification for entry into the world of potential\rmemory.<p>\rIt is harder to hive off aspects of nursing duties and give them to lower paid\radjuncts if that work is relatively opaque.  The test sites that are\rimplementing NIC have provided some degree of resistance here, arguing that\ractivities should be specified - so that, within a soft decision support model\ra given diagnosis can trigger a nursing intervention constituted of a single,\rwell-defined set of activities.  As Marc Berg (forthcoming 1996)  has noted in\rhis study of medical expert systems, such decision support can only work\runiversally if local practices are rendered fully standard. A key professional\rstrategy for nursing - particularly in the face of the ubiquitous process\rre-engineer - is realized by deliberate non-representation in the information\rinfrastructure.  What is remembered in the formal information systems resulting\ris attuned to professional strategy and to the information requisites of the\rnurses' take on what nursing science is.<p>\rThere is a brick wall that they come up against when dealing with nurses on the\rspot: if they overspecify an intervention (that is break it down into too many\rconstituent parts), then it gets called, in the field, an NSS classification -\rwhere NSS stands for `No shit, Sherlock' and is not used (Timmermans, Bowker\rand Star, forthcoming).  The project team sees the classification scheme as\rhaving to be very prolix at present; but when the practice of nursing itself is\rfully standardized, some of the words will be able to wither away.  They point\rto intervention classifications used by doctors, which are much less verbose -\rand can afford to be, they argue, because every doctor knows the standard form\rof treatment for, say, appendicitis.  (Though they also argue that there are\rlocal variations in medical practice which have been picked up by good\rreporting procedures, and that NIC will be able to provide such a service for\rnursing - leading to an improvement in the quality of practice). It is assumed\rthat any reasonable education in nursing or medicine should lead to a common\rlanguage wherein things do not need spelling out to any ultimate degree.  The\rinformation space will be sufficiently well pre-structured that some details\rcan be assumed.  Attention to the finer-grained details is delegated to the\reducational system, where it is overdetermined.<p>\rThese NIC erasure strategies - dealing with overspecification and the political\rdrive to relative autonomy by dropping things out of the representational space\r- are essential for the development of a successful potential memory. The two\rforms of erasure of local context are needed in order to create the very\rinfrastructure in which nursing can both appear as a science like any other and\ryet nursing as a profession can continue to develop as a rich, local practice.\rThe ongoing erasure is guaranteed by the classification system: only\rinformation about nursing practice recognized by NIC can be coded on the forms\rfed into a hospital's computers or stored in a file cabinet.<p>\r<p>\rNursing informaticians agree as a body that in order for proper healthcare to\rbe given and for nurses to be recognized as a profession, hospitals as\rorganizations should code for nursing within the framework of their memory\rsystems: nursing work should be classified and forms should be generated which\rutilize these classifications.  However, there has been disagreement with\rrespect to strategy.  <p>\r<p>\rTo understand the difference that has emerged, recall one of those forms you\rhave filled in (we have all experienced one) which do not allow you to say what\ryou think.  You may, in a standard case, have been offered a choice of several\rracial origins; but may not believe in any such categorization.  There is no\rroom on the form to write an essay on race identity politics.  So you either\ryou make an uncomfortable choice in order to get counted, and hope that enough\rof your complexity will be preserved by your set of answers to the form; or you\rdon't answer the question and perhaps decide to devote some time to lobbying\rthe producers of the offending form to reconsider their categorization of\rpeople.  The NIC group has wrestled with the same strategic choice: fitting\rtheir classification system into the Procrustean bed of all the other\rclassification systems that they have to articulate with in any given medical\rsetting in order to form part a given organization's potential memory; or\rrejecting the ways in which memory is structured in the organizations that they\rare dealing with.  We will now look in turn at each of these strategies.<p>\r<p>\rLet us look first at the argument for including NIC within the potential memory\rframework of the hospital.   They argue that NIC has to respond to multiple\rimportant agendas simultaneously.  Consider the following litany of needs for a\rstandard vocabulary of nursing practice:<p>\rIt is essential to develop a standardized nomenclature of nursing diagnoses in\rorder to name without ambiguity those conditions in clients that nurses\ridentify and treat without prescription from other disciplines; such\ridentification is not possible without agreement as to the meaning of terms.\rProfessional standards review boards require discipline-specific\raccountability; some urgency in developing a discipline-specific nomenclature\ris provided by the impending National Health Insurance legislation, since\rdemands for accountability are likely both to increase and become more\rstringent following passage of the legislation.  Adoption of a standardized\rnomenclature of nursing diagnoses may also alleviate problems in communication\rbetween nurses and members of other disciplines, and improvement in\rinterdisciplinary communication can only lead to improvement in patient care.\rStandardization of the nomenclature of nursing diagnoses will promote health\rcare delivery by identifying, for legal and reimbursement purposes, the\revaluation of the quality of care provided by nurses; facilitate the\rdevelopment of a taxonomy of nursing diagnoses; provide the element for storage\rand retrieval of nursing data; and facilitate the teaching of nursing by\rproviding content areas that are discrete, inclusive, logical, and consistent .\r(Castles, 1981, 38)<p>\rI have cited this passage at length since it unites most of the motivations for\rthe development of NIC.  The development of a new information infrastructure\rfor nursing, heralded in this passage, will make nursing more `memorable'.  It\rwill also lead to a clearance of past nursing knowledge - henceforth\rprescientific - from the textbooks; it will lead to changes in the practice of\rnursing (a redefinition of disciplinary boundaries) - a shaping of nursing so\rthat future practice converges on potential memory.<p>\r<p>\rMany nurses and nursing informaticians are concerned that the profession itself\rmay have to change too much in order to meet the requirements of the\rinformation infrastructure.  We murder, they note, to dissect.  In her study of\rnursing information systems in France, Ina Wagner (1993)  speaks as follows of\rthe gamble of computerizing nursing records:<p>\rNurses might gain greater recognition for their work and more control over the\rdefinition of patients' problems while finding out that their practice is\rincreasingly shaped by the necessity to comply with regulators' and employers'\rdefinitions of 'billable categories' (Feldberg 1990).<p>\rIndeed, a specific feature of this 'thought world' into which nurses are\rgradually socialized through the use of computer systems is the integration of\rmanagement criteria into the practice of nursing.  <p>\rShe continues: AWorking with a patient classification system with time units\rassociated with each care activity enforces  a specific time discipline on\rnurses.  They learn to assess patients' needs in terms of working time.<a\rhref=\"forget_fn.html#fn0\">[3]</a>  This analytic perspective is shared by the\rIowa nurses.  They argue that documentation is centrally important; it not only\rprovides a record of nursing activity but structures same: <p>\rWhile nurses complain about paperwork, they structure their care so that the\rrequired forms get filled out.  If the forms reflect a philosophy of the nurse\ras a dependent assistant to the doctor who delivers technical care in a\rfunctional manner, this is the way the nurse will act.  If the forms reflect a\rphilosophy of the nurse as a professional member of the health team with a\runique independent function, the nurse will act accordingly.  In the future,\rwith the implementation of price-per-case reimbursement vis-a-vis diagnosis\rrelated groups, documentation will become more important than ever. (Bulechek\rand McCloskey, 1985, 406).<p>\rAs the NIC classification has developed, observes Joanne McCloskey, the\rtraditional category of `nursing process' has been replaced by `clinical\rdecision making plus knowledge classification'.  And in the representation of\rNIC that she produced (Diagram 5), both the patient and the nurse had dropped\rentirely out of the picture (both were, she said, located within the `clinical\rdecision making box' on her diagram) (IIP 6/8/95).  A recent book about the\rnext generation nursing information system argued that the new system:<p>\rcannot be assembled like a patchwork quilt, by piecing together components of\rexisting technologies and software programs.  Instead, the system must be\rrebuilt on a design different from that of most approaches used today: it must\rbe a data-driven rather than a process-driven system.  A dominant feature of\rthe new system is its focus on the acquisition, management, processing, and\rpresentation of 'atomic-level' data that can be used across multiple settings\rfor multiple purposes. The paradigm shift to a data-driven system represents a\rnew generation of information technology; it provides strategic resources for\rclinical nursing practice, rather than just support for various nursing tasks.\r(Zielstorff et al., 1993, 1).<p>\rThis speaks to the progressive denial of process and continuity through the\rsegmentation of nursing practice into activity units.  Many argue that in order\rto `speak with' databases at a national and international level just such\rsegmentation is needed.  The fear is that unless nurses can describe their\rprocess this way (at the risk of losing the essence of that process in the\rdescription), then it will not be described at all.  They can only have there\rown actions remembered at the price of having others forget, and possibly\rforgetting themselves, precisely what it is that they do.<p>\r<p>\rSome nursing informaticians have chosen rather to challenge the memory\rframework existing in the medical organizations they deal with.  They have\radopted a Batesonian strategy of responding to the threat of the new\rinformation infrastructure by moving the whole argument up one level of\rgenerality and trying to supplant `data-driven' categories with categories that\rrecognize process on their own terms.  Thus the Iowa team pointed to the fact\rthat women physicians often spend longer with patients than male doctors, but\rthey need to see patients less often as a result: they argue that just such a\rprocess-sensitive definition of productivity needs to argued for and\rimplemented in medical information systems in order that nursing work gets\rfairly represented (IIP 6/8/95).  They draw from their secret (because\runrepresented) reservoir of knowledge about process in order to challenge the\rdata-driven models from within. <p>\r<p>\rWithin this strategy, the choice of allies is by no means obvious.  Since with\rthe development of NIC we are dealing with the creation of an information\rinfrastructure, the whole question of how and what to challenge becomes very\rdifficult.  Scientists can only, willy nilly, deal with data as presented to\rthem by their information base, just as historians of previous centuries must,\ralas, rely on written traces.  When creating a new information infrastructure\rfor an old activity, questions have a habit of running away from one: a\rtechnical issue about how to code process can become a challenge to\rorganizational theory (and its database).  A defense of process can become an\rattack on the scientific world view.  One of the chief attacks on the NIC\rscheme has been made by a nursing informatician, Susan Grobe,  who believes\rthat rather than standardize nursing language computer scientists should\rdevelop natural language processing tools so that nurse narratives can be\rinterpreted.  Grobe argues for the abandonment of  any goal of producing: A a\rsingle coherent account of the pattern of action and beliefs in science (Grobe,\r1992, 92); she goes on to say that: Aphilosophers of science have long\racknowledged the value of a multiplicity of scientific views\" (92).  She\rexcoriates Bulechek and McCloskey, architects of NIC, for having produced work:\rAderived from the natural science view with its hierarchical structures and\rmutually exclusive and distinct categories. (93).   She on the other hand is\rdrawing from cognitive science, library science and social science (94).  Or\ragain, a recent paper on conceptual considerations, decision criteria and\rguidelines for the Nursing Minimum Data Set cited Fritjof Capra against\rreductionism, Steven Jay Gould on the social embededness of scientific truth\rand praised Foucault for having developed a philosophical system to Agrapple\rwith this reality (Kritek, 1988, 24).  Nurse scientists, it is argued, Ahave\rbecome quite reductionistic and mechanistic in their approach to knowledge\rgeneration, at a time when numerous others, particularly physicists, are\rreversing that pattern (27).   And nursing has to find allies amongst these\rphysicists:<p>\rNurses who deliver care engage in a process.   It is actually the cyclic,\rcontinuous repetition of a complex process.  It is difficult, therefore, to\rsketch the boundaries of a discrete nursing event, a unit of service, and,\rtherefore, a unit of analysis.  Time is clearly a central force in nursing care\rand nursing outcomes.  Nurses have only begun to struggle with this factor.  It\rhas a centrality that eludes explication when placed in the context of quantum\rphysics. (Ibid., 28)<p>\rThe point here is not whether this argument is right or wrong.  It is an\rinteresting position.  It can only be maintained, as can many of the other\rpossible links that bristle through the NIC literature, because the information\rinfrastructure itself is in flux.  When the infrastructure is not in place to\rprovide a `natural' hierarchy of levels, then discourses can and do make\rstrange connections between themselves. <p>\r<p>\rIn order to not be continually erased from the record, nursing informaticians\rare risking either modifying their own practice (making it more data driven) or\rwaging a Quixotic war on database designers.   The corresponding gain is great,\rhowever.  If the infrastructure itself is designed in such a way that nursing\rinformation has to be present as an independent, well defined category, then\rnursing itself as a profession will have a much better chance of surviving\rthrough rounds of process re-engineering and nursing science as a discipline\rwill have a firm foundation.  The infrastructure assumes the position of Bishop\rBerkeley's God: as long as it pays attention to nurses, they will continue to\rexist.  Having ensured that all nursing acts are potentially remembered by any\rmedical organization, the NIC team will have gone a long way to ensuring the\rfuture of nursing.  <p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<i>Part 2 - Classification systems: potential memory and forgetting</i><p>\r<p>\r<p>\rThree social institutions, more than any others, claim perfect memory: the\rsister institutions of science, the law and religion.  The legal and clerical\rprofessions claim perfect memory through an intricate set of reference works\rwhich can be consulted for precedence on any current case.  The applicability\rof past to present is a matter of constant concern: argued in the law courts or\rin theological disputes.  Scientific professionals, though, tend to claim that\rby its very nature science displays perfect memory: and they structure their\rrecall primarily through a myriad of classification systems that gives them a\rvast reserve of potential memory (scientific articles are in principle - though\rnever of course in practice - coded in such a way that an experiment performed\rone day in Algeria can be entirely replicated a hundred years later in\rAfghanistan). We will now go on to draw some more general conclusions about the\rways in which classification systems structure memory within organizations,\rtaking as a chief example the nature and operation of classification systems in\rscience.  There are two major reasons for choosing the institution of science\rfor our wider discussion - the NIC development team claims to be rendering\rnursing scientific, and so these wider examples develop naturally out of Part 1\rabove; and classification work has been more formalized in science than in\rother institutions<p>\r<p>\rIt can readily be accepted that great discoveries were made but not recognized\ras such at the time (the cases of Kepler and Mendel are canonical).  But not\rthat discoveries were made, recognized, and then forgotten.  Traditionally in\rscience the discourse of perfect memory has not been that of the file folder -\rthough notable publications have claimed to be `archives' for their respective\rdisciplines.  The more general  claim to perfect memory is that this is in the\rvery nature of science.  Take, for example, Henri Poincare's <u>Science and\rHypothesis</u> (1905).  All scientific work, for Poincare and many positivists,\rwent towards the construction of an eternal palace.  Poincare uses the metaphor\rof an army of scientists, foot soldiers, each adding a brick or so to the\redifice of science: AThe scientist must set in order.  Science is built up with\rfacts, as a house is with stones (101).  The thing about bricks is that they\rdon't get forgotten: they are there in the nature of the edifice.  Nobody need\ractively recall them: buildings don't remember.  But each brick that is in a\rbuilding is continuously present and is therefore ageless.  In another\rmetaphor, he sees the work of doing physics as similar to building a collection\rof books - with the role of the theorist being to facilitate information\rretrieval, to catalogue: <p>\rLet us compare science to a library that ought to grow continually.   The\rlibrarian has at his disposal for his purchases only insufficient funds.  He\rought to make an effort not to waste them.<p>\rIt is experimental physics that is entrusted with the purchases.  It alone,\rthen, can enrich the library.<p>\rAs for mathematical physics, its task will be to make out the catalogue.  If\rthe catalogue is well made, the library will not be any richer, but the reader\rwill be helped to use its riches. (104)<p>\rThe very nature of theory, then, is that it furnishes a classification system\rwhich can then be used to remember all (and only that) which is relevant to its\rassociated practice.<p>\r<p>\rAll classification systems, however, face a bootstrapping problem.  In a world\rof imperfect knowledge, any classificatory principle might be good, valid,\ruseful: you won't know what makes a difference until you have built up a body\rof knowledge that relies, for its units of data, on the classification scheme\rthat you have not yet developed.  This is Spinoza's problem.  Consider its form\rin the world of medical record keeping - a world in which every trace might\rcount.  In order to maintain a good system of medical records, a state needs to\rclassify a huge mount of information about not only its own citizens, but about\rcitizens of countries that it is in contact with (classification systems are\rnecessarily imperialistic; witness the protests of African doctors to pressures\rfrom western AIDS researchers).  The need for information and thence the burden\rof classificatory activity is effectively infinite.  A wish-list for a national\rmedical information system in America included the following:<p>\rall factors affecting health ... genetic and biological, environmental,\rbehavioral, psychological, and social conditions which precipitate health\rproblems; complaints, symptoms and diseases which prompt people to seek medical\rcare; and evaluation of severity and functional capacity, including impairment\rand handicaps (Rothwell, 1985, 169-170).<p>\rEach of these sets of factors involves a classification scheme.  There is no\rtelling what information will be relevant: <p>\rto classify a chisel, a hand drill, and a spanner together as `hand tools', or\rthe first two as `cutting and piercing instruments' may be obscurantist, or\reven misleading.  Whereas to one accident researcher it is significant that a\rchisel is edged, a drill pointed, and a spanner neither, to another it may be\rmore important that the chisel is pushed, the spanner turned and the drill\roperated by rotary motion.  (Heidenstrom, 1985, 76)<p>\rIn a world in which, as Ann Fagot-Largeault (1990, 6) has pointed out, it is\rimpossible to die of old age (the category of being `worn out' having been\rremoved from the ICD) it appears that we are afloat in a sea of multiple,\rfractured causalities each demanding their own classification systems - and\rtheir own apparatus of record collection.   To deal with the plenum of\rinformation that all good organizations logically need, one can operate a\rdistribution of memory in space (such and such a subgroup needs to hold such\rand such knowledge) and a distribution of memory in time (such and such a\rmemory will only be recalled if a given occasion arises).<p>\r<p>\rClassification systems provide both a warrant and a tool for forgetting at the\rsame time as they operate this distribution.  To take an overview of this\rprocess, let us consider the case of the classification of the sciences.\rAuguste Comte wrote about this in the first volume of his course of positive\rphilosophy, wherein he lays out a new classification of all the sciences in\rhierarchical order, each science having a statics and a dynamics.  He argued\rthat it was only at the current state of advancement of science that a true\rclassification system could emerge: since only now were the forces of religion\rand metaphysics sufficiently at bay that a true picture of the nature of\rknowledge could emerge.  At the same time, the sum total of scientific\rknowledge was sufficiently great that it was inconceivable to learn a science\rby tracing its history: there were too many wrong turns, blind allies,\rvagaries.  (Just, one might note, as one does not want to remember where one's\rkeys are by tracing the series of actions that one has made in the past several\rhours).  With the new classification system, knowledge could be arrayed\rlogically and naturally - one would lose chronological order but gain\rcoherence.  Indeed, only in this way could science be logically taught; indeed:\rA... the most important property of our encyclopedic formulation ... is that it\rdirectly gives rise the true general plan of an entirely rational scientific\reducation. (Comte, 1975 [1830-45], 50)<a href=\"forget_fn.html#fn0\">[4]</a>\rWhat is left, in Comte's work, is the positivist calendar, where certain great\rscientists have their days, just as the saints had theirs in the age of\rreligion.  Serres annotates this passage with the observation that the\rformation (training) of scientists covers up and hides the formation\r(production) of scientific knowledge (51).  <p>\r<p>\rIndeed Comte sets in train a double motion.  On the one hand, you will only\rlearn science if you forget its history; on the other hand, you will only\runderstand the history of science if you look at the entire history of\rhumanity: <p>\rThis vast chain is so real that often, in order to understand the effective\rgeneration of a scientific theory, the mind is led to consider the\rperfectioning of some art with which it has no rational link, or even some\rparticular progress in social organization without which this discovery would\rnot have taken place. ... It follows therefore that one cannot know the true\rhistory of any science, that is to say the real formation of the discoveries it\ris composed of, without studying, in a general and direct manner, the history\rof humanity. (52)<p>\rOn the one side we have the complete history of humanity, where nothing can be\rforgotten because everything might be relevant; and on the other an efficient\rclassification system which allows us to remember only what we need to remember\rabout science.  The classification system operates a clearance, in that all\rthat was religious and metaphysical is wiped away with a single gesture; it\roperates selective erasure in that even in the current scientific age the\rprocesses of the production of knowledge will have to be erased from the\raccount of the knowledge itself.  The classification system tells you what to\rforget and how to forget it.  It operates a double distribution in space of\rscientific memory.  Firstly, the social story of science will be excluded from\rthe organization of the sciences, and held outside of it (if at all) by\rhistorians.  This is a form of erasure.  Secondly, it offers a naturally\rhierarchy of the sciences, saying that a given discipline (say geology,\rstatics) will need to remember all and only a given set of facts about the\rworld.  It also operates a distribution in time, saying that all scientific\rproblems can be progressively unfolded - so that at one point along the path in\rtreating a social problem you will need to draw on biology, then chemistry,\rthen physics, then mathematics: each type of memory which has been distributed\rin space will also be sequenced in time.  The plenum is contained by the\roverarching organization constituted by the scientific community precisely\rthrough a controlled program of first clearance then continuing erasure.  The\rwork of conjuring the world into computable form (cf Hutchins, 1995) has\ralready been begun by the setting up of a certain kind of formal memory system\r- for example, one in which facts can be stored in linear time and space.<p>\r<p>\rIn the history of science, we frequently encounter an apposition between\rclearance, the deliberate destruction of the past, and establishment of a\rclassification system.  When Lavoisier set out to found the new discipline of\rchemistry, he wrote a textbook which standardized the names of the elements (so\rthat Ag became silver: not Diane's metal, a name that 'remembered' the\ralchemical prehistory of the discipline).    He also rewrote the history of\rchemistry so that his rivals, arguing the theory of affinities, no longer\roccupied a place in the textbooks: they were written out of the historical\rrecord. (Bensaude-Vincent, 1989).  <p>\r<p>\rThe strategy of clearance is a complete wiping clean of the slate, so that one\rcan start anew as if nothing had ever happened.  As in the example of the\rburning of the books, it is doubtful if clearance can ever work in the short\rterm since people do remember things and institutional arrangements do bear\rtraces of their past - as in the case of an outmoded classifcation system being\rreflected in the arrangements of artifacts in a museum; however in the long\rterm, by the time that the curricula have been redesigned, the manuals\rrewritten and new nursing information systems produced it can be a highly\reffective tool.  Clearance is a pragmatic strategy: it may well be the case\rthat a given organizational routine or piece of knowledge has roots in the\rdistant past, and yet it may also be the case that dealing with said routine or\rknowledge it is easier to act  as if it had just arrived on the scene.  It is\rfor this reason that the issue of truth or falsity of memory can be a red\rherring in treatments of organizational memory as well as analytically\rundecidable: a false memory, well constructed through a program of forgetting,\rcan be of great use.<p>\r<p>\rErasure is a key dimension of classification work in all organizations.  There\ris a famous passage in the Sherlock Holmes stories where Watson informs Holmes\rthat the earth circles the sun; Holmes politely thanks Watson and then remarks\rthat he will try to forget this fact as soon as possible, since it is a kind of\rfact that cannot possibly be relevant to the task that is ever at hand for him:\rthe solution of crime.   In scientific organizations, things get deliberately\rforgotten in a variety of ways.  They classify away traces that they know to be\rrelevant but which should not be officially recorded.  For example, when I\rlooked at the early archives of the <i>Schlumberger</i> company, I was struck\rby a change in the written traces being left of company activity.  In the early\rdays the boxes contained a series of highly detailed reports of daily activity\rsent by engineers in the field across the world to the company's center of\rcalculation, to borrow Callon's felicitous phrase, in Paris (Callon, 1986).\rThe theory, explicitly stated, was the company needed the best possible records\rof what went on in the field in order to build up a sufficiently large database\rso as to construct scientific knowledge, and so as to co-ordinate strategies\rfor the insertion of the company into the oil field environment.  Then one day\rthings changed.  Detailed accounts in French of work practice became sketchy\rtables in English of numbers of oil wells logged.  What had happened?  The\rcompany had gotten involved in a legal suit with <i>Halliburton</i> and had\rcome to realize that its own internal traces of activity were open to potential\rscrutiny by US courts determining patent claims.  There were two simultaneous\rrealizations: first the records should be in English, since the French language\rcould be read by a Southern court as a foreign code; and secondly the records\rshould only contain kinds of facts that leant weight to the company's official\rpresentation of itself: that is to say the cycle of accumulation of messy\rhalf-truths should be carried out elsewhere than in the organization's own\rpotential memory system (Bowker, 1994, Chapter 3).  This strategy of\rdistributed erasure is more punctillist than that of clearance: it involves the\rsystematic and deliberate forgetting of some actions in order to better\rremember others.  In Adrienne Rich's words, this is an act of silence (AThe\rtechnology of silence/The rituals, etiquette/the blurring of terms/silence not\rabsence ... Silence can be a plan/rigorously executed (Rich, 1978,\r17)).<i></i><p>\r<i></i><p>\rClassification systems subtending information infrastructures operate as tools\rof forgetting (without representation in the medical informatics infrastructure\rthe profession of nursing is progressively erased from the annals both of\rhistory and of science).  They also operate as tools for delegating attention\r(Latour, 1996 has an extended discussion of this sense of delegation).  Nurses\rdo not want to have to carry around in their heads what drugs the patients on\rtheir wards need to be taking and when: they either use written traces or\relectronic means to hold the memory and perhaps automatically remind them\r(either directly by commanding attention through a beeping sound or routinely\rby constituting distributed traces that the nurse will encounter on their\rnormal rounds - for example the canonical chart at the foot of the patient's\rbed).  The storage of information in a section of an organization's permanent\rrecord guarantees that heedful attention (Weick, 1993)  is paid to that\rinformation in either the production of organizational knowledge (formal\raccounts of how the organization works) or the organization's production of\rknowledge (how the hospital, say, contributes to the production of nursing\rknowledge).<p>\r<p>\rIn order to produce nursing (and other) knowledge, then, various kinds of\rforgetting need to be operated on the permanent record held by organizations.\rThis suggestion is fully complementary to the results from science studies and\rorganization theory that many significant memories are held outside of formal\rinformation infrastructures.  Ravetz (1971), Latour (1987) and many others have\rnoted that one cannot do scientific work without being able to draw on\rinformation about specific local, organizational details of the operation of a\rgiven laboratory; and yet that information is nowhere systematically stored.\rIn a series of studies of Xerox technicians, Julian Orr has shown that formal\rrepresentations of fault diagnosis is often, on the spot, supplemented and\rindeed replaced by the swapping of war stories (`I had a machine that did\rsomething like that...' and so forth).  I do not go into the preservation of\rnursing stories - which Julian Orr's work (e.g. Orr, 1990) and others' assures\rus will be generated alongside of and as a complement to formal representations\rof nursing work.  Further, new information infrastructures such as a hospital\rinformation system adopting NIC will in fact retain traces of organizational\rwork and will despite themselves allow for the sharing of organizational\rmemory.  Later work by Star and myself will develop the concept of\rorganizational repression (by analogy to repressed memories) to discuss this.\rThe argument comes down to asking not only what gets coded in but what gets\rread out of a given scheme (for example for the latter, who learns what from\rthe fact that the coding book always falls open on a given page? - cf Brown and\rDuguid, 1994 on the importance of such peripheral clues).  However, just as\roral history is a significant form of community memory, it is a different kind\rof memory (dates are far less important, stories migrate between characters and\rso forth - see Vansina, 1961) from that retained in the written record.  My\remphasis in this paper has been purely on the nature and articulation of what\rgoes down in the continuing formal record that the organization preserves of\rits own past activity.  This latter area is interesting in its own right\rbecause it is by using these memories that transportable formal accounts used\rin law, science, management will be constructed.<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<p>\r<i>Conclusion</i><p>\rInformation, in Bateson's famous definition, is about differences that make a\rdifference.  Designers of classification schemes constantly have to decide what\rreally does make a difference; along the way they develop an economy of\rknowledge which articulates clearance and erasure and ensures that all and only\rrelevant features of the object (a disease, a body, a nursing intervention)\rbeing classified are remembered - for in this case the classification system\rcan be incorporated into an information infrastructure that is delegated the\rrole of paying due attention. A corollary of the `if it moves, count it' theory\ris the proposition `if you can't see it moving, forget it'.  The nurses we\rlooked at tried to guarantee that they won't be forgotten (wiped from the\rrecord) by insisting that the information infrastructure pay due attention to\rtheir activities.<p>\r<p>\rIn this paper, I have argued that here may indeed be good organizational\rreasons for forgetting.  I have also argued that the ways in which things get\rforgotten are not merely images in a glass darkly of the way things get\rremembered; rather they are positive phenomena worthy of study in their own\rright.  I have discussed two kinds of forgetting: clearance and erasure.   From\rthis emerged a consideration of forgetting and potential memory (mediated by\rclassification systems).<p>\r<p>\rI have stressed that representation in the formal record is not the only way to\rbe remembered: indeed there is a complex ecology of memory practices within any\rone organization.  However, the shift into long-term memory that the\rinfrastructure provides is significant, if fraught.  The production of\rtransportable knowledge used in other registers (scientific texts, the law) at\rpresent assumes that this knowledge can be stored and expressed in a quite\rrestricted range of genres.  At the limit, as we saw with Poincare, it can be\rargued that scientific theory is about the storage of information in such\rlong-term memory.  In order to prevent continuing erasure within hospital\rinformation systems, nurses have had to operate a clearance of their own past\r(recorded history begins today).  The prize before their eyes is a science and\ra profession; the danger oblivion (either being definitively excluded from\rongoing information practices and thus relegated to an adjunct role or being\rincluded but then distributed through re-engineering).<p>\r<p>\rThere is much to be done to understand the processes of commemoration, memory,\rhistory and recall in organizations.  Organizational forgetting and\rorganizational memory are useful concepts here because they allow us to move\rflexibly between the formal and the informal, the material and the conceptual.\rDesigners of information superhighways need to take the occasional stroll down\rmemory lane.<p>\r<b>References:</b><p>\r<b></b><p>\r<b></b>Abbott, A.
