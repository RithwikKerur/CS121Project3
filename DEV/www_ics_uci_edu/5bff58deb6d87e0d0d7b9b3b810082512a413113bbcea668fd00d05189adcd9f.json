this is\r\n  a problem that gets worse during the quarter, so starting out by doing the\r\n  \"right thing\" in this assignment is an excellent idea.\r\nIf you have any questions about these instructions, for example, if you\r\n  think they are in error, or just confusing, please contact me.\r\nDo it directly by sending email to me, or for issues of concern to everyone\r\n  in the class, by sending email to the class discussion list; often you can\r\n  do both in the same email, making it trivial for me to reply directly to you\r\n  while answering your discussion email (going to the rest of the class) at\r\n  the same time.\r\n<p>\r\nCarefully read the last two sections, on <b>Extra Credit</b> and <b>Time\r\n  Management</b>.\r\nThese important sections are relevant to all programming assignments, but\r\n  appear only in this one.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Questionnaire -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Questionnaire\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Part 1:<br>Questionnaire</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nDownload a copy of the course <a href=\"questionnaire.doc\">Questionnaire</a>,\r\n which is a Microsoft Word file.\r\nRead and edit this questionnaire (in Microsoft Word), filling in the answers to\r\n  all its questions.\r\nNote that the questions on the first page are about you, your experience, \r\n  your goals, and your expectations;

get into the habit of\r\n   being able to ask us questions, especially in lab.\r\n<p>\r\nTo do this assignment, you must have already downloaded and installed Java\r\n  and the Eclipse IDE on your own computer (or be using one of the UCI\r\n  Lab machines, where it has already been downloaded/installed).\r\n<p>\r\nIn the <b>first part</b>, you will start a new project and write a trivial\r\n  program.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In Eclipse, create a new Java project and a new class in it (in the\r\n      anonymous package), both named <b>Test1</b>.\r\n    When creating that class, specify (via a checkbox) inclusion of a\r\n      <b>public static void main(String[] args)</b> method (otherwise you will\r\n      have to type in this code yourself).\r\n<li>First, delete the comment (lines 4-6) and instead put a comment on line\r\n      1 with your name. My comment would appear as\r\n    <b><pre>//Richard Pattis</pre></b>\r\n<li>Replace the body of that method, by replacing the line <br>\r\n      <tt>// TODO Auto-generated method stub</tt><br>\r\n       comment by the single statement\r\n      <b><pre>System.out.println(\"Java program test scceeded!\");</pre></b>\r\n<li>Run (compile and execute) this program to ensure that it produces the\r\n      correct output in the Console.\r\n    You might need to edit it if you incorrectly typed the line above; in\r\n      fact, if you know a bit of Java, now is a great time to experiment\r\n      with introducing, recompiling, and fixing small syntax errors -by seeing\r\n      how the Eclipsed IDE reports and helps correct them.\r\n<li>Close this project; in fact, go ahead and delete this project from the\r\n      the workbench, but ensure the <b>Delete project contents on disk (cannot\r\n      be undone)</b> button is <b>NOT</b> checked.\r\n<li>Move the project folder from the workspace onto your desktop.\r\n<li>Copy this project folder (including its contents) onto your ICS Lab\r\n      space and/or USB memory (always do this to save your work, even if you\r\n      are using your own computer; you can optionally zip it first).\r\n<li>Delete this project folder, empty the recycle bin, and log off your\r\n      computer.\r\n<li>Log back on to the computer; download the project folder that you just\r\n      uploaded onto the desktop put it in some folder\r\n      (not the <b>workspace</b>), to ensure that you saved it correctly\r\n      (unzip it first, if  necessary).\r\n   You should be able to create a Java project and specify this project file\r\n     as the existing source from which to create the project.\r\n   Ensure that it still compiles and executes correctly.\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you have any problems, please ask for help during the lab.\r\nAfter you are finished, repeat these steps a few times, until you can do them\r\n  from memory.\r\nThis programming assignment is very cookbook, but by the end you should\r\n  have mastered the steps needed in creating and manipulating projects with\r\n  Eclipse -something you will do over and over again during the quarter.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter you have finished, submit the file you created, <b>Test1.java</b>,\r\n  using the <b>Homework Dropff</b> link.\r\n<p>\r\nIn the <b>second part</b>, you will download a project and use it in the\r\n  Eclipse IDE.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Download the <a href=\"Collatz.zip\">Collatz</a> project folder and unzip it\r\n      to a folder on your desktop.\r\n    It should contain only one file, named <b>Collatz.java</b>.\r\n<li>In Eclipse, create a new Java project named Collatz, click the\r\n      <b>Create project from existing source</b> radio button, and then\r\n      browse to specify the Collatz folder as the existing source from which\r\n      to create the project.\r\n<li>Edit the <b>Collatz.java</b> file.\r\n    Diclose and read the comments at the top of the <b>Collatz.java</b>\r\n      file to understand what this program does.\r\n<li>Try to run the program as an application.\r\n    Eclipse will indicate four syntax errors; ensure that you see the error\r\n      messages in the <b>Problems</b> tab, on the bottom window: disclose\r\n      these four errors.\r\n    <b>Note</b>: If an error involves the <b>Prompt.forInt</b> method, it means\r\n      that you did not correctly follow the instructions at the end of the\r\n      Installing Java and Eclipse document for installing the class library;\r\n      redo those steps.\r\n<li>Fix these three errors as follows\r\n    (you are not expected to understand these errors yet).\r\n    Be careful! \r\n    The descriptions of the errors aren't great: two specify a way to fix a\r\n      problem, but NOT THE RIGHT WAY for this code.\r\n    We cannot just blindly follow these suggestions.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>In the expression statement on line 67\r\n      (do you have the line numbers turned on in Eclipse? if not turn them on),\r\n      put a <tt>+</tt> after the last <b>String</b> in quotes, and before the\r\n      identifier <b>testNumber</b>.\r\n<li>In the expression statement on line 75, put a\r\n      <tt>;</tt> (semicolon) after the <tt>++</tt> operator.\r\n<li>In the expression statement on line 76, replace\r\n      the <tt>=</tt> operator by the <tt>==</tt> operator (no spaces\r\n      between the two equal signs).\r\n<li>In the expression statement on line 77, replace\r\n      the identifier <tt>testnumber</tt> by the identifier <tt>testNumber</tt>\r\n      (notice the capital <b>N</b>).\r\n</ol>\r\n<li>After fixing the errors, save the program and try to run the program again.\r\n    When prompted for a number, enter 7, which ultimately requires 17 cycles to\r\n      be reduced to 1.\r\n<li>Close this project; in fact, go ahead and delete this project from the\r\n      the workbench, but ensure the <b>Do not delete contents</b> button is\r\n      checked.\r\n<li>The <b>Collatz.java</b> file in the Collatz project folder you used to\r\n      create this project should be updated with the fixes that you entered.\r\n<li>Copy this project folder (including its contents) onto your ICS Lab\r\n      space and/or USB memory (always do this to save your work, even if you\r\n      are using your own computer; you can optionally zip it first).\r\n<li>Delete this project folder, empty the recycle bin, and log off your\r\n      computer.\r\n<li>Log back on to the computer; download the project folder that you just\r\n      uploaded onto the desktop put it in some folder\r\n      (not the <b>workspace</b>), to ensure that you saved it correctly\r\n      (unzip it first, if  necessary).\r\n   You should be able to create a Java project and specify this project file\r\n     as the existing source from which to create the project.\r\n   Ensure that it still compiles and executes correctly.\r\n</ul>\r\nIf you have any problems, please ask for help during the lab.\r\nAfter you are finished, repeat these steps a few times, until you can do them\r\n  from memory.\r\nThis programming assignment is very cookbook, but by the end you should\r\n  have mastered the steps needed in creating and manipulating projects with\r\n  Eclipse -something you will do over and over again during the quarter.\r\n<p>\r\nAfter you have finished, submit the corrected file you modified\r\n  <b>Collatz.java</b>, using the <b>Homework Dropff</b> link.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\r\nYou will be writing many programming assignments during the quarter, requiring\r\n  you to create new projects or modify existing ones.\r\nYou should be able to manipulate both kinds of projects easily in Eclipse.\r\n<p>\r\nAlso, whenever you want to write a small program to test out your understanding\r\n  of Java, you should have a very low threshold to quickly creating a project\r\n  and writing the experimental code that you want to test.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Extra Credit -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ExtraCredit\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Extra Credit</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nProgramming assignments must be turned in on time: you can get partial credit\r\n  for a partially completed assignment, but it must be turned in on time; I\r\n  will accept no late homework unless you have an official excuse pre-arranged\r\n  with me (and even then you should turn in whatever work you have completed\r\n  by the due date/time).\r\nIn fact, there is another incentive to finish not only on time, but to\r\n  <b>finish early</b>.\r\n<p>\r\nIn all programming assignments, if you turn in everything at least 24 hours\r\n  before it is officialy due, you will receive 1 point of extra credit.\r\nIf you turn it in 48 hours (or earlier), you will receive 2 points of extra\r\n  credit.\r\n(There is no more extra credit for early turn-ins; I recommend NOT turning it\r\n  in more than 48 hours early.)\r\nThis is equivalent to a half a grade improvement (e.g., C+ to B, or B to B+,\r\n  or B+ to A) on a 40 point assignment.\r\nIn previous quarter, over 50% of the students completed their assignments\r\n  early and received some amount of extra credit; it adds up.\r\n<p>\r\nThere are two main advantages to planning on finishing early.\r\nFirst, if you run into a major problem, you will have extra time to solve it\r\n  before the actual due date: and even experienced programmers frequently run\r\n  into such problems.\r\nYes, this means you!\r\nSecond, and more importantly, if you are racing to finish before a deadline,\r\n  stress levels can go through the roof, and you become less interested in\r\n  learning the material (and the whole purpose of these programming assignments\r\n  is to learn the material) and more interested in just getting it finished.\r\nIf you do not learn the material, you will be at a major disadvantage for all\r\n  subsequent programming assignments and tests, because of the cumulative\r\n  nature of the material in this course.\r\nTherefore, plan to finish <b>every</b> assignment by Monday or Tuesday evening.\r\n<p>\r\nProgramming assignments sometimes also include an extra credit section worth\r\n  1-2 points.\r\nThese are designed for students who finish early and want to continue exploring\r\n  programming within the context of the assignment.\r\nThe points are to acknowledge, in a small way, their extra effort.\r\n<p>\r\nThis assignment has no special extra-credit section.\r\nYou can get extra credit on it only for an early dropoff.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Time Management -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"TimeManagement\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Time Management</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nOne of the hardest parts of being in college is learning how to manage your\r\n  time.\r\nTime management is especially important in programming courses (and in the real\r\n  world, when you are working on complicated projects with hard deadlines).\r\nThe difference between good and bad time management can have a profound impact\r\n  on how much you learn in this course, how well you perform in it, and how\r\n  much effort you actually need to expend to do well.\r\n<p>\r\nI will try to divide most programming assignments into a series of smaller\r\n  tasks, each that can serve as a milestone; when solved in sequence, these\r\n  tasks will complete the entire assignment.\r\nWhen we start writing programs, we will discuss such a <b>divide and\r\n  conquer</b> method more formally, calling it <b>iterative enhancement</b>.\r\n<p>\r\nGenerally, it is best to spread out the work on a week-long assignment.\r\nMost assignemnts become available on Thursday morning; I recommend reading the\r\n  assignment during lab (the day it is discussed in lab) so that if you\r\n  are unsure about any parts of it, you can ask relevant questions about them\r\n  in lab; this reading includes running the executable files included with\r\n  each assignment, to see how the program should behave (including its input\r\n  and output -which you must match).\r\nYou should start working on it during lab, and should plan to complete at\r\n  least half the programming assignment over the weekend.\r\nYou should finish it early the following the week: if not by Monday, you can\r\n  use the lab on Tuesday to get finish it, asking questions of the starff\r\n  during the lab.\r\n<p>\r\nSome students look at an assignment and think that it is best done in one\r\n  sitting.\r\nIf you can do so, great; but, if you plan to work this way, do the one sitting\r\n  over the weekend, not Wednesday night!\r\nIn this way, if you are wrong about the amount of time that it will take, you\r\n  will still have adequate time to complete the assignment.\r\nBy meeting these time goals, you will both maximize what you learn and minimize\r\n  your anxiety and the time that it takes for you to do the learning.\r\n<p>\r\nRemember that assignments must be turned in on time: you can get partial credit\r\n  for a partially completed assignment, but it must be turned in on time; I\r\n  will accept no late homework unless you have an official excuse pre-arranged\r\n  with me (and even then you should turn in whatever work you have completed\r\n  by the due date/time).\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, if you find yourself falling behind, seek help immediately (from me,\r\n  the TA, the Lab Tutor, or even other students in the course -when\r\n  appropriate).\r\nWhen the real programs start, we will discuss what kind of help you can get\r\n  legitimately, and what kind of help constitutes cheating.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
