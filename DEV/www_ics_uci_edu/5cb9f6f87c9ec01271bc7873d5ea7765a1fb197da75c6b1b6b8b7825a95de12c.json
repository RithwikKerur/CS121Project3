We present techniques for using\nsocial gravity as an additional force in force-directed layouts,\ntogether with a scaling technique, to produce drawings of trees and\nforests, as well as more complex social networks. Social gravity\nassigns mass to vertices in proportion to their net- work centrality,\nwhich allows vertices that are more graph-theoretically central to be\nvisualized in physically central locations. Scaling varies the\ngravitational force throughout the simulation, and reduces crossings\nrelative to unscaled gravity. In addition to providing this\nalgorithmic framework, we apply our algorithms to social networks\nproduced by Mark Lombardi, and we show how social gravity can be\nincorporated into force-directed Lombardi-style drawings. \n\n<p>\n(Joint work with Michael J.
