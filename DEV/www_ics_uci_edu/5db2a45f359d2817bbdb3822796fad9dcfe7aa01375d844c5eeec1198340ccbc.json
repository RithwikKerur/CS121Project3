This course will not only\nbroaden your technical horizons but also focus on systematic problem solving.\n We welcome you and we hope you enjoy it.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  This course\ndoes not expect any previous experience in computer science or computer\nprogramming.  If you do have some experience, you will find some topics\nfamiliar but many others will certainly be new to you.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">We do expect each student to be able to navigate\nthe Windows  systems in our labs, to navigate the World-Wide Web, to download\nand read documents in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format, and to read and send electronic\nmail.  Some of our assignments will require these skills.  If you need to\npick these skills up or sharpen them, do it in the first week of the quarter;\nspeak with us if you need a hand.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Meeting place and times:  </B>Lecture meets\nsix hours each week:  Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00 to 12:20 \nand also from 2:00 to 3:30 in Steinhaus Hall 174. Each student must enroll in one of these lab sections:<br />\n1. Monday/Wednesday/Friday from 1:00 to 2:50 p.m. in ICS 189<br />\n2. Monday/Wednesday/Friday from 3:00 to 4:50 p.m. in ICS 189</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">None of these hours are optional. Most of your lab work will be done in pairs,\n  so the scheduled lab times are the best times to\n  work with your partner.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Office hours:  </B>You are welcome to drop by my office at any time.  If I'm there and not immersed in something\nelse, I'll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics.\n I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours,\nduring which course-related matters will have first priority:  Tuesdays from 3:20 (right after class) to 3:45 and Fridays from 12:15 to 12:45. I may adjust these times at the end of the first week. Of course emergencies\nmay come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change. I'll\nalso be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't skip it  without getting in touch).  The\nquickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail, as described\nbelow.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can\nusually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours\n(a bit less frequently on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to the\nID </FONT><A HREF=\"mailto:i41@uci.edu\"><code>i41@uci.edu</code></A><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">.\n This goes to all of us, and whoever reads it first can respond.  If you\nneed to reach one of us individually, use our individual IDs listed above. I will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam filters snag a legitmate message. Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet Email address will help your messages get noticed.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">We may also send course announcements by Email\n    to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email daily.\n    Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar\n    has for you (your UCInet ID).

Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated,\nbut in the past the actual cutoffs have often been lower; this means that\nyou should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale indicates.\n If you&#39;re concerned, check with your TA or the instructor.  The basic\nscale is:  grades in the A range (A-, A, and in exceptional cases, A+),\n90% and above; grades in the B range, 80%&ndash;90%; grades in the C range, 70%&ndash;80%. We urge everyone to focus not on letter grades but on learning what's necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Your TA has primary responsibility for evaluating\nyour work; see the TA first for any questions about grading or scoring. \nIf that does not resolve your question, then see the instructor.  Quiz and lab scores will be recorded on the web at eee.uci.edu. We will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we\nmust ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the\nitem is returned; the course moves quickly and we simply can&#39;t deal\nwith assignments long past.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">We&#39;re required to say that in unusual circumstances,\nthese criteria could change, but we do not expect that to happen.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations.

It&#39;s not fair to ask the TA simply to repeat\n  lecture material you missed, though of course the TA will always answer questions about\n  it.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Attend your lab section, too;\n  assignments will be checked off there, you will do most of your lab work there, and you can get a different perspective there than you hear in lecture.\n  Don&#39;t hesitate to ask your TA to address topics  that will help you. \n  Since most of your work will be done with a partner, your partner also depends\n  on your consistent presence.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Check your electronic mail regularly; this\n  is an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Keep up with the reading; you&#39;ll need it\n  to do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed\n  pages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#39;re not careful.  You\n  will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about parts\n  that aren&#39;t clear. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">The assignments, like all technical specifications,\n  require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back\n  to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about\n  what&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure\n  to read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Start each assignment early.  Assignments will\n  be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly every\n  day.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will,\n  even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll\n  have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">If you find yourself having trouble or getting\n  behind, speak with your TA or the instructors.  We have lots of ways to help.\n  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and\n  turning it in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on\n  a lab assignment.  ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more\n  complete discussion, see our course collaboration guidelines (<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/honesty.html\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/honesty.html</code></a>) and the ICS departmental web page covering academic\nhonesty issues (</FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php/index.php#cheating\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php/index.php#cheating</code></A><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">).</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Turn in whatever portion of an assignment you\n  have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something\n  rather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances\n  you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after the\n  due date, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date\n  comes.  Likewise, don&#39;t skip any quizzes if you can help it; too many zeroes will significantly lower your overall score.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Always keep your own copy of each assignment,\n  both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\n  shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),\n  we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n</p><TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0>\n  <COL WIDTH=8% />\n  <COL WIDTH=15% />\n  <COL WIDTH=77% />\n  <TR>\n    <TD WIDTH=8% VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Week</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Date</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=77% VALIGN=TOP><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Topics (and chapters in the Picturing Programs text)</U></FONT></TD>\n  </TR>\n  <TR>\n    <TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
