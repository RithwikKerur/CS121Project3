I will lay out what I know.\r\n\r\nIsidore came to the USA as an unmarried man, on 19 Oct 1906 aboard the \r\nship Pretoria. His last residence (permanent) was Krakow. He was going \r\nto his brother Adolf (Abraham) Langsam, 127 Forsyth St, NYC. He was born \r\nin Krakow. Based on ship records and a letter whose details an earlier \r\nresearcher published, Adolf, Anna, Ida, and Isidore were siblings. Their \r\nmother was Ruje and their father Selig, from Krakow. Isidore's Jewish \r\nname was Izak (Yitzchok). \r\n\r\nAccording to US vital records and the Jewish Records Indexing - Poland \r\nproject, Izak was born July 8, 1888. More vital records data regarding \r\nhis birth can be found on Akt 401 in film 1895667 (at a local Family \r\nHistory Center) which records Krakow Births from 1888. Let me know if \r\nyou are interested in this. Based on his March 18, 1916 Brooklyn \r\nNaturalization, his wife was Jenny, born in Tarnow (now in Poland), \r\nlisted as being 28 years old (1888?). They had two children at the time,\r\nRalph, born in Newark, NJ on Feb 7, 1911, and Abraham in Brooklyn on \r\nMarch 14, 1914. His occupation was \"Hatter\". His witnesses were Herman \r\nRosenberg and Harry Kleinhandler, both hatters.\r\n\r\nReturning to Izak's siblings - Adolf, Anna, and Ida were already mentioned. \r\nIda was widowed and came to the US in 1920, age 28. her late husband's name \r\nseems to have been Nachemie. Another  sibling seems to have been Goldie, \r\nborn in 1883, came to the US in 1908. Also one of Izak's sisters married \r\nJacob Schultz of NY. The other Krakow birth records that seem to match in \r\nname or time frame are:\r\nLANGSAM Abraham, born 1884 Akt 369 film 1895666                   \r\nLANGSAM Chana, born 1886 Akt 291 film 1895666                   \r\nLANGSAM Izak, born 1888 Akt 401 film 1895667                   \r\nLANGSAM Abraham Abe, born 1889 Akt 260 film 1895667.\r\n\r\nIsidore's brother, Adolf, married Gussie (Jewish name Malka) and had \r\nthree children. Leo, David Schmuel and Rosalind (married to Louis \r\nQuaytman). David's children are Howard Earl (Jewish name Tzvi Hersh) \r\nand Louis (Jewish name Levi [Eli]Melech). Louis, married to Bryna \r\nSchneider, has two children, Michael and Elisa. In 1986 he was living \r\nin Seal Beach, CA.\r\n\r\nPlease share some detail regarding your own family and what you might \r\nknow regarding Isidore (Izak)'s offspring and other siblings. \r\n\r\nAlso of interest, do you know of any other Langsam cousins, outside of \r\nthe offspring of Isidore (Izak) or his siblings. This will help to \r\npossibly connect other branches of our tree. \r\n\r\nI have some of this data scanned in, please let me know if I should email \r\nyou copies of the ship manifest and naturalization.\r\n\r\n-Moishe Miller\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\nwww.langsam.com\r\n_____________________________________________________________________  \r\nFrom: \"Richard Langsam\" <rl@abberleykooiman.com> \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: Langsam Family \r\nDate: Fri, 30 Nov 2001 10:41:20 -0500 \r\nOrganization: Abberley Kooiman LLP \r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response and detailed information. I have to \r\ntell you I am completely blown away by learning of the breadth of the \r\nLangsam family.  I am fascinated by it- as I essentially lost contact \r\nwith the Langsam family upon the death of my father when I was 5 years \r\nold. I am now 48. I had always been under the impression, (I\u2019m not sure \r\nfrom where) that the Langsam family was a small one.  Indeed, the few \r\nLangsam\u2019s that I have come across in NYC are either not Jewish or did \r\nnot appear to be relatives from my scant knowledge of the family. From \r\nyour website, I now know the error of my belief.  I am quite interested \r\nin seeing where I fit into the family tree you have been compiling- your \r\nwebsite is incredible, I am still wandering through it.  \r\n\r\nI will provide what sketchy information that I have about my branch of \r\nthe tree  and would love to receive the materials you mentioned that you \r\nhave regarding Isidore's entry into the United States as well as any other \r\nsuggestions you may have for finding more information. Isidore\u2019s wife, my \r\ngrandmother, Jenny predeceased Isidore and he remarried a woman that I \r\nknew only as \"Grandma Goldie\". Isidore's three sons\u2019 families are as \r\nfollows:  \r\n*  Abraham (wife Sylvia) had one son Richard (me) and one daughter Bette \r\n   Lynne (now Bette Lynne Pricer); \r\n*  Solomon (the youngest son) was married to Marsha and had one son, Joel; \r\n*  Ralph was married to Bernice and had one son, Lawrence and one daughter, \r\n   Diane.  \r\n\r\nDo you have any information regarding Isidore\u2019s parents or into which branch \r\nof Pesach's family he fits? If you do, I would be very interested in securing \r\nsuch information.\r\n\r\nAlso, how does one get a copy of the \u201cLangsam-Spira\u201d book you mention on your \r\nwebsite?\r\n \r\nAgain, many thanks for providing this insight into my long lost family.\r\n\r\nRichard Langsam\r\n_____________________________________________________________________  \r\nDate: Sun, 02 Dec 2001 00:12:06 -0500\r\nTo: \"Richard Langsam\" &lt;rl@abberleykooiman.com>\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Langsam Family\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nThanks for your kind words. I am very happy to try and place you on the \r\ntree. Unfortunately, there is still not enough detail to do that. Perhaps \r\nif you can obtain the microfilmed vital records we would uncover more \r\nleads and details. Is that something that you are interested in pursuing? \r\n\r\nDo you have any connection with the cousins that I mentioned (or didn't)? \r\nThey may help provide more details/leads. How about the death (or marriage) \r\nrecord for Isidore? I work in NYC (near ground zero) and may be able to \r\nlook up the marriage record at 31 Chambers. Regarding your request, I will \r\nemail them as attachments. Can you supply a mailing address as well? \r\n\r\nSuzan Wynne's email is srwynne@erols.com. Let me know when you receive the\r\nbook and I will walk you through what I see as your section. \r\n\r\nAttached are the images I have scanned.\r\n\r\nWhat other Langsam's have you met that were not Jewish? I have not met any \r\nthat did not have Jewish roots.\r\n\r\n-Moishe\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\n_____________________________________________________________________  \r\nDate: Wed, 26 Dec 2001 07:00:19 -0800 (PST) \r\nFrom: Richard Langsam <rhlangsam@yahoo.com> \r\nSubject: Re: attachment \r\nTo: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com> \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your update.
