However, some of us have spent more time than \nothers reading about and listening to what he has to say. He is Rush \nLimbaugh. Recently, while browsing the web, I came across a document titled<a \nhref=\"http://www.primenet.com/~triplet/files/35truth.html\"> Rush Limbaugh's 35 Undeniable \nTruths</a>. I hope you agree that this is a <i>very</i> neat Web finding. \n<li>My second neat Web site I got off of Prof. Douglas Krause's home page. It is a document \nconcerning this <a href=\"http://www.best.com/~dijon/americana/index.html\"><img \nsrc=\"http://www.best.com/~dijon/images/usaflag2.gif\" alt=\"\"> great \nnation</a> of ours. This site is very cool because it includes links to some great American \ndocuments like the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. <li>The <a \nhref=\"http://www.rutgers.edu/x-files.html>X-Files</a> is one of the best new T.V. shows around. It is \nalso a very neat Web site, however, it's best features are audio snippets and the theme song which \ncannot be \nheard in the Pentium lab because of audio capabilities. Nevertheless, this is a site worth checking out \nbecause of it's pictures and short write-up's.  </ol>\n\n<A NAME=\"Questions\"><H2>Questions I can now answer</H2></a>\n<ol>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ1\">What are the three main aspects that characterize the World-Wide Web?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ2\">What is the \"client-server architecture\" as it relates to the World-Wide Web?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ3\">What is anthropology and why would someone major in it?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ4\">Who is Richard Leakey and what does he have to do with anthropology?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ5\">What are some jobs that people in anthropology pursue?</A>\n</ol>\n\n<HR>\n<OL>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ1\"><B>What are the three main aspects that characterize the World-Wide Web?</B></A>\nThe three main characteristics of the World-Wide Web \nare hypertext, multimedia, and the Internet. \n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/WhatIs.html\">Hypertext</a> refers to the kind of documents \nfound on \nthe Web. They are basically the same as plain text documents with the added feature of what <a \nhref=\"http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~dduchier/misc/vbush/as-we-may-think.html\">Vannevar Bush</a> \ncalled \"selection by association.\" With a \nhypertext document there are connections within the text to other related documents. Multimedia simply \nrefers to the Web's capability to incorporate graphics, sound, video, and animation in it's documents. \nThe Internet is the global mass of cables and computers that make the World-Wide Web possible by \nproviding the physical links between the network of computers that make up the Web. <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>What is the \"client-server architecture\" as it relates to the World-Wide \nWeb?</B></A>\nThe client-server architecture is the overall plan by which different computers interact within the \n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html\">World-Wide Web</a> schema. The <a \nhref=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Terms.html\">\"client\"</a> aspect is actually a computer \nprogram or browser which runs on a \ncomputer operated by a human user. The \"server\" is a computer with a program that runs all the time and \ncontains some information. The client contacts the server with a request for information. In response, \nthe server provides the information to the client and the human is happy. The client-server \narchitecture can also be characterized as an \"agent\" relationship because a server of one client can in \nturn be a client to another server. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>What is anthropology and why would someone major in it?</B></A>\n<a href=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?anthropology\">Anthropology</a> is, in very \ngeneral terms, the study of mankind. This study can include theory of human \norigin and evolution, called physical anthropology, human cultural development, called cultural \nanthropoloy, as well as the study of human social customs and beliefs, called social anthropology. \nThere are actually many branches of anthropology which extend into more specific and limited areas, \nsuch as linguistics and archeology. As to why one would choose to major in the subject, it is \ndifficult to say. Perhaps one enters into anthropology after being enthralled by a lecture from one \nof the greats, Richard Leakey for instance. Another reason why someone might choose anthropology as a \nmajor might be that after extensive <a href=\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/\">world travel</a> one realizes \nhis/her \nintensive interests in the specifics of the world's various cultures and simply must learn more.<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>Who is Richard Leakey and what does he have to do with anthropology?</B></A>\nRichard Leakey is the son of Louis and Mary Leakey whose pioneering archaeological field work in the \neastern regions of <a href=\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/vt2/africa.html\">Africa</a> has contributed \nfundamentally to the field of physical anthropology. Richard Leakey has \ncontinued the work of his parents and is currently the director of the National Museum of Kenya. He has \nwritten several books concerning the evolution of our species and its possible future, the most recent \nof which is entitled <i>Origins</i>. Mr. Leakey is not only in the forefront of <a \nhref=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?archaeology\"> archaeology</a> and physical \nanthropology but also contributes to animal protection and preservation in East Africa. He spoke on \nthis latter issue last year when he gave a lecture at the Bren Events Center.  <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>What are some jobs that people in anthropology pursue?</B></A>\nMajoring in anthropology allows one to consider entering many different areas in pursuit of a career \nchoice. I suppose the most obvious extension of attaining an undergraduate degree in anthropology is to \ncontinue one's studies in the field by attending graduate school. This route will most likely lead to a \nlife of teaching and occasional field studies. One could also use the humanistic background provided by \nan anthropological education to enter fields such as <a \nhref=\"http://www.law.indiana.edu/law/lawindex.html\">law</a>, psychology,  \n<a href=\"http://www.analysys.co.uk./commslib.htm\">communications</a>, or social work. <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 07, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
