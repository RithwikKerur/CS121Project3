(SODA99) by G. Woeginger<br>\nSpeaker: <a href=\"/~josephw/\">Joseph Wang</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</h2>\n\nWe derive results of the following flavor: If a combinatorial\noptimization problem can be formulated via a dynamic program of\ncertain structure and if the involved cost and transition functions\nsatisfy certain arithmetical conditions, then the optimization\nproblem automatically possesses a fully polynomial time\napproximation scheme (FPTAS). Our characterizations provide a\nnatural and uniform approach to fully polynomial time approximation\nschemes. We illustrate their strength and generality by deducing\nfrom them the existence of FPTASs for a multitude of scheduling\nproblems. Many known approximability results follow as corollaries\nfrom our main result. \n\n<p></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
