Many reduced Bit-width Instruction Set\nArchitectures (rISA) (e.g., ARM-Thumb) are being increasingly used to\ndecrease code size. Previous work has explored energy savings in\nnon-cached rISA architectures as a byproduct of code size\nreduction. In this paper we present an energy efficient code\ngeneration technique for rISA architectures, and furthermore explore\nenergy savings for both cached and non-cached architectures. Our code\ngeneration technique uses profile information to find the most\nfrequently executed parts of the program. By aggressively reducing\ncode size on frequently executed parts, fewer fetches to instruction\nmemory are incurred, thus reducing the power consumption of the\ninstruction memory. We achieve an average 30% reduction in instruction\nmemory energy consumption in cached systems, on a variety of\nbenchmarks, as compared to non-rISA architectures.\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"left\">\n      Center For Embedded Computer Systems,<br> \n      Department of Information and Computer Science,<br>\n      University of California, Irvine.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
