Note that this form is to be\ndone in a three step process. First, the team member (non-manager ) must\nfill out part I; second, the manager must fill out part II, while the team\nmember fills out part II; thrid, the manager reads and signs part III,\nwhile the team member reads and signs part II. In part I, the team member\nwill describe her /his own responsibilities, accomplishments and potential\nimprovement. In part II, the manager will review the team member's appraisal\nand rate her/his performance. In part III, the team member will rate the\nmanager's performance. The purpose of the three steps is so that both team\nmember and manager know how they are being rated. You should be honest\n<B>without </B>being vengeful. Keep in mind that a bad rating in many of\nthe indeces is not indicaative of a poor performance and will certainly\nnot relfect in your grade. Note that <B>all </B>appraisals should cover\nonly the phase in question. Please hand in all appraisal forms with your\ndeliverable. You will be marked down only for failing to fill out appraisals\n(either team member or manager ), handing in illegible forms, or giving\ntoo little detail.</P>\n\n<P>\n<HR WIDTH=\"100%\"></P>\n\n<P><A HREF=\"f1.html\">Part I</A> | <A HREF=\"f2.html\">Part II</A> | <A HREF=\"f3.html\">Part\nIII</A> | <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics126/wq99_syllabus.html\">ics\n126 A&amp;B syllabus</A> | <A HREF=\"logform.html\">course log</A> </P>\n\n<P>\n<HR WIDTH=\"100%\"></P>\n\n<P><BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\n</P>\n\n<P><BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR>\n<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\n</P>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
