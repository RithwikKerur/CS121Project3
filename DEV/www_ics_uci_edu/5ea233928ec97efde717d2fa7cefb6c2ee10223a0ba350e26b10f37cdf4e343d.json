Question D21 in Richard K. Guy's Book\n\"Unsolved Problems in Number Theory\" (Springer-Verlag) rudimentarily discusses\nthe problem. This triangle is defined as one with rational sides, rational\nmedians, rational altitudes, and hence rational area.\n\nIn my own research on a personal computer, the following 16 sets of almost\nperfect rational triangles were found where the 3 sides and medians are\nrational, but not the area.\n\n   Rational Triangles with rational sides and medians\n\n     Sides               Medians               Area\n\n  87   85   68       79     65.5  63.5     sqrt(7207200)            1\n\n 328  207  145      264.5  231.5  71       sqrt(105814800)          2\n\n 290  243  113      261.5  183.5 122       sqrt(179071200)          3 \n\n 442  255  233      341.5  329.5 104       sqrt(521060400)          4 \n\n 325  314  159      309.5  202   188.5     sqrt(602330400)          5 \n\n 409  386  327      362.5  316   293.5     sqrt(3491888400)         6 \n\n 477  446  277      440.5  320   284.5     sqrt(3670959600)         7 \n\n 807  491  466      626    611.5 257.5     sqrt(10759694400)        8  \n\n 907  774  581      791.5  656   512.5     sqrt(49744094400)        9  \n\n1664 1323  509     1481.5 1037.5 559       sqrt(77318060400)       10 \n\n1339 1099  810     1156    960.5 695.5     sqrt(197794674000)      11 \n\n1917 1306  877     1580.5 1340   564.5     sqrt(237944926800)      12 \n\n1929 1640  839     1740.5 1241   875.5     sqrt(466612146000)      13 \n\n2822 2007 1105     2385.5 1893.5 796       sqrt(769017916800)      14 \n\n1603 1524 1223     1439.5 1205  1125.5     sqrt(771033463200)      15\n\n1973 1778 1401     1742.5 1462  1260.5     sqrt(1456477999200)     16 \n\nIn addition, the following 2 sets of triangles were found that had 3 rational\nsides, 2 rational medians and a rational area.

Also it should be noted that taking the medians, and using\nthem as sides, leads to a conjugate triangle, so all these solutions listed\ncome in pairs. In the second case, this means a rational triangle with 2\nrational sides and 3 rational medians.\n\nCan anyone out there find more examples, especially of the second type listed,\nand mail the results back to me at <A HREF=\"mailto:randall@ncr-sd.UUCP\">randall@ncr-sd.UUCP</A>? These will be forwarded\nto Prof. Richard K. Guy in Calgary, Alberta, of course, so he can append and\nupdate his information on Problem D21 in his excellent book.\n\nThanks again, if your interest is stimulated by this article, and you decide\nto work upon finding more rational triangles.\n\n- Randall   &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:randall@ncr-sd.UUCP\">randall@ncr-sd.UUCP</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:gerry@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au\">gerry@macadam.mpce.mq.edu.au</A> (Gerry Myerson)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Can anyone solve this puzzle\n<B>Date:</B>           13 Dec 1993 17:39:06 -0600\n<B>Organization:</B>   CeNTRe for Number Theory Research\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn article &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:R.DELOACH.9.00100B58@larc.nasa.gov\">R.DELOACH.9.00100B58@larc.nasa.gov</A>&gt;, Dick DeLoach wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Given an equilateral triangle with an inclosed point, is there a \n&gt; placement of the point such that the distance to each vertex is an integer \n&gt; when the side of the triangle is also an integer?

A draft I have reads, modulo some \nlight editing, as follows:\n\nThere are infinitely many solutions of the problem of integer distances \nfrom the corners of an equilateral triangle of side t. John Leech has \nsent us a neat and elementary proof of the fact that the points at \nrational distances from the vertices of any triangle with rational sides \nare dense in the plane of the triangle. This result was proved earlier \nby Almering. Arnfried Kemnitz notes that a = m^2 + n^2; \nb, c = m^2 +/- mn + n^2 with m = 2(u^2 -v^2), n = u^2 + 4uv + v^2 gives \nt = 8(u^2 - v^2)(u^2 + uv + v^2) and an infinity of solutions in which \nthe points are neither on the sides nor the circumcircle of the triangle. \nA computer search showed that (57, 65, 73, 112) was the smallest such. \n\nAmong the references Guy lists, the following may be relevant: \n\nJ.

Look for our paper in the American Mathematical Monthly.\nRecently, looking at some Legendre elliptic curves that Ralph\nand I discovered, and at some concordant forms of the 1/2 angle\ntangents of Heron 2 median triangles and 3 median triangles, I\nfeel that the perfect triangle does NOT exist.

With some examination, it can be seen that 7\nterms occur, and solutions have been found in 3 types, wherein\nthe 7th parameter is irrational, the other 6 rational. Two types\nare the body and face cuboids, e.g. 104,153,672(697) face cuboid\nand 44,117,240(sqrt(73225)) body cuboid which are the smallest\noccurrances with integer sides. Edge cuboids exist also. I've\nfound over 29,000 of the 3 types, they occur in a B:E:F 3:2:3 ratio.\nNo perfect cuobids were found with the smallest edge &lt; 1,281,000,000\nThis is problem D18 of Dr. Richard K. Guy's \"Unsolved Problems\nin Number THeory\"\nTHe other problem is the nesting of right triangles inside each\nother, and how far chains of primitive right triangles can nest.\nI have found up to 16 such chains of right triangles.
