likewise, there is  no way that you can learn all this material\r\n  starting now (I'm assuming that you've been learning it during the entire\r\n  quarter).\r\n<p>\r\nTherefore, you should concentrate on reviewing the most important analysis\r\n  and synthesis skills that we have studied.\r\nUse the quizzes (and to a lesser extent the programming assignments and daily\r\n  homework assignments) as a guide for what material is of primary importance.\r\nUnderstand the material on its own terms, and how to use this material when\r\n  writing code.\r\n<p>\r\nMy written exams are not designed to determine if you understand obscure\r\n  material; instead, they are designed to determine if you understand\r\n  important material, and can use your knowledge to understand and answer\r\n  questions <b>quickly</b>.\r\nMy exams are long (some students will not finish them): it you don't\r\n  immediately know the answer to a question, skip it, and come back to it\r\n  later, if you have time (sometimes working problems later in the exam will\r\n  remind you of something relevant to the answer to earlier questions).\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Outline of Lecture Topics</h2>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Software<ul>\r\n  <li>General Aspects of Software: Development & Costs\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n<li>EBNF<ul>\r\n  <li>Understanding EBNF rules and descriptions: sequence, option, alternative repetition\r\n  <li>Reading EBNF rules and classifying symbols\r\n  <li>Determining whether EBNF descriptions are equivalent\r\n  <li>Examining exemplars and writing EBNF rules that classify them accordingly\r\n  <li>Translating between EBNF rules and EBNF diagrams\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Tokens<ul>\r\n  <li>Understanding how Java reads and tokenizes programs\r\n  <li>Tokens: Identifiers, Keywords, Separators, Operators, Literals, Comments\r\n  <li>The syntax of literals: int, double, boolean, char, String\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Variables and Operators<ul>\r\n  <li>Understanding variable declarations (drawing pictures)\r\n  <li>Reading and writing prototypes;
