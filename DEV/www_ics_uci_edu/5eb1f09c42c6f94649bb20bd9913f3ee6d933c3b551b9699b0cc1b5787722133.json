Intuitively, it captures both how evenly the vertices are distributed, and how evenly the lengths of the edges incident to each vertex are distributed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe first formalize this intuition. We then present a recent bound on the edge-length ratio of outerplanar graphs, and a new drawing style that has low ply number for a certain class of outerplanar graphs. We believe that it may be possible to combine these ideas to produce drawings with low ply number for all outerplanar graphs.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
