Once you've found a site that interests you, it \nis important to remember where it is located.  Luckily, there is an \nefficient way of marking and going to certain sites quickly.  The quick \nway of accessing other systems is by putting the URL of the system onto a \n<a href=\"http://ddi.digital.net/info/hot/\"><b>hotlist</b></a>. <a \nhref=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/hotlist.html\"><b>Professor \nFranklin's</b></a> hotlist is an example of a well made and informative \nhotlist of various sites on the Web.    \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>How can you search for various types of information on the Web with only \nkey words and no URL's?</B></A>\nIn order to be able to go to various sites on the World Wide Web, it is \nnecessary to have the URL's of the various servers.  There is a very \nuseful tool available on the Web to anyone who wants to use it; this \ntool is called the <a href=\"http://webcrawler.cs.washington.edu/webcrawler/webquery.html\"><b>Webcrawler</b></a>. \n The Webcrawler allows you to search for various servers on the Web that \nhave information on topics that you find interesting.  For example, if \nyou wanted information on music, then you could type the word music in \nWebcrawler and it will send you to servers that contain information on \nmusic.
