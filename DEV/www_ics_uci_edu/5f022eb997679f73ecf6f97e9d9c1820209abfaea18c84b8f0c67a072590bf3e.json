Infostructures often contain a wide variety of \ninformation sources, in the form of interlinked documents at distributed \nsites, which are maintained by a number of different document owners \n(usually, but not necessarily, the original document authors). Individual \ndocuments may also be shared by multiple infostructures. Since it is \nrarely static, the content of an infostructure is likely to change over \ntime and may vary from the intended structure.  Documents may be moved or \ndeleted, referenced information may change, and hypertext links\nmay be broken. \n\nAs it grows, an infostructure becomes complex and difficult to maintain. \nSuch maintenance currently relies upon the error logs of each server \n(often never relayed to the document owners), the complaints of users \n(often not seen by the actual document maintainers), and periodic manual \ntraversals by each owner of all the webs for which they are responsible. \nSince thorough manual traversal of a web can be time-consuming and boring, \nmaintenance is rarely or inconsistently performed and the infostructure \neventually becomes corrupted. What is needed is an automated means for \ntraversing a web of documents and checking for changes which may require \nthe attention of the human maintainers (owners) of that web. \n\nThe Multi-Owner Maintenance spider (MOMspider) has been developed to at \nleast partially solve this maintenance problem. MOMspider can periodically \ntraverse a list of webs (by owner, site, or document tree), check each web \nfor any changes which may require its owner's attention, and build a special \nindex document that lists out the attributes and connections of the web \nin a form that can itself be traversed as a hypertext document. This paper \ndescribes the design of MOMspider and how it was influenced by the nature \nof distributed hypertext maintenance and requirements for the good behavior \nof any web-traversing robot. It also includes discussion of the efficiency \nrequirements for maintaining world-wide webs and proposed changes to HTML \nand HTTP to support distributed maintenance. The paper concludes with a \nshort description of MOMspider's future and pointers to its freeware\ndistribution site. \n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Tue Feb 28 11:28:47 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
