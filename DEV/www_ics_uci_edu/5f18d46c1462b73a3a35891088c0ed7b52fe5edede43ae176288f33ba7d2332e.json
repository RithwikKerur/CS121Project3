My picnic table is square, with four legs, and I need to find \n&gt;   a place on the hill where it will be stable with the top horizontal. \n&gt;   Is there necessarily such a position?\n\n&gt; What assumptions can we make about the size of the table with respect to\n&gt; the minumum radius of curvature of the hill?  For example, if the hill is\n&gt; very pointy, and the table is pretty big, then it seems like it would be\n&gt; hard to have the legs on the ground.  Instead, the point of the hill would\n&gt; stick into the underside of the table; hardly a stable situation.\n\n&gt;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Gene Stark\n\nThe \"correct\" assumptions are that the legs are arbitrarily long (but of the\nsame length), that the hill is given by a continuous non-negative function\ndefined inside a compact convex disk D, and that the table is to be \nplaced on the hill in the sense that its center lies over D.  Then the\nanswer is yes there is such a position.  This is due to Roger Fenn,\n\"The Table Theorem\", Bull London Math Soc 2 (1970), 73-76.

I have some discussion of this on my\nweb site, <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/jordan-square.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/jordan-square.html</A>\nand would be very interested in hearing about progress on this problem.\n\nHere is a proof sketch for smooth curves.  I made it up, but I don't\nexpect it to be original; I haven't read previous proofs of similar results.\n\nConsider the set of ordered pairs (x,y) of unequal points on the curve.\nTopologically, the ordered pairs form a torus, but the restriction that\nthey be unequal turns this into an open annulus.  We can embed this\nannulus geometrically as the set {(a,b): 1 &lt; a^2+b^2 &lt; 2} in such a way\nthat that swapping x and y corresponds to a 180degree rotation of the\nannulus: -(a,b) = (-a,-b)\n\nFor each such pair (x,y) let point p(x,y) denote the corner clockwise\nfrom x on a square having diagonal xy.  Classify the points of the\nannulus as \"in\" if p(x,y) is inside the Jordan curve, \"out\" if p(x,y) is\noutside the Jordan curve, and \"on\" if it is on the curve.  Obviously,\nwhat we want to find is (a,b) for which (a,b) and -(a,b) are both\nclassified \"on\".\n\nThen (for smooth curves) the points near one boundary of the annulus are\nall classified \"in\", the points near the other boundary are all\nclassified \"out\", and the points classified \"in\" and \"out\" are both open\nsets. Without loss of generality let's say that the \"out\" points are\nalong the outer boundary of the annulus.  Let S be the connected\ncomponent of the points classified \"out\" near this boundary of the\nannulus, and consider the set (S union -S).  This is a connected open\nset, topologically a multiple-punctured disk.  Consider the component of\nits boundary that contains the origin.  Some of the boundary points are\ncluster points of S (in particular, the point realizing the infimum of\nabsolute values of points in S is such a boundary point) and similarly\nsome of the boundary points are cluster points of -S.  So there must be\na boundary point (a,b) that is a cluster point of both S and -S.  Note\nthat (a,b) must be strictly interior to the annulus since all points\nnear the other boundary are \"in\".  Since it is a cluster point of the\n\"out\" points, but not an \"out\" point itself (since it is on the boundary\nof an open set) it must be an \"on\" point, and similarly -(a,b) is also\nan \"on\" point, QED.\n\nIt looks like the proof generalizes a little, to curves such that, at\neach point, the left and right derivatives make an obtuse angle.  But it\ndoesn't work for all Jordan curves; for instance the equilateral\ntriangle has both \"in\" and \"out\" points near both boundaries of the\nannulus.  In this particular case, there are only a constant number of\nmisclassified points, presumably easily enough handled, but one could\nimagine more monstrous examples in which the \"in\" and \"out\" points are\ndense on both boundaries.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           \"Tapio Hurme\" &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:hurmecom@dlc.fi\">hurmecom@dlc.fi</A>&gt;\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 2 Jul 1999 21:11:09 +0300\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: The Hardest Geometry Problem in the World\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nDavid's poster was inspiring.\n\nMaybe Holditch's theorem would help - this is just an idea:\n\"Take a smooth, closed convex curve and let a chord of constant lenght slide\naround it.

Therefore the centre of the circle draws the new closed\n|curve inside the original closed convex curve.The area between the two\n|curves is now pi*p^2 = pi*q^2.\n\nWell -of course the sliding chord would be the side of the wanted square,\ni.e. one (or the longest side) of the wanted square is 2*p=2*q or more\nsimply p+q. (Note that at this point we are searching a square but not\nnecessarily rectangular square.) The radius of a circle (A), which goes\nthrough the 2 edges or the corners of the wanted square with side 2*p, is\np*squareroot(2).\n\nThe centre of a circle (A) is \"somewhere\" perpendicular to the middle point\nof the sliding chord. In other word - the sliding side of the wanted square\nis tangent of the new circle (B), which touches the middle point of the\nwanted square. Circle (A) and circle (B) has the same centre.\n\nIf we now let a circle (B) with radius p=q roll inside the drawn smooth,\nclosed convex curve (C-2) that was the result as the centre point of the\nwanted square traced out, we have the third smooth, closed convex curve\n(C-3) for all the centre points of the circle with radius p*squareroot(2)\nbecause it is at the perpendicular distance of radius p from curve (C-2).\nCurve (C-3) draws therefore all the centre points of circle (A) and circle\n(B).\n.\nCertainly the circle (A) exists, if p/2 is smaller than the longest diameter\nof closed curve C-1, and it touches at least two corners of the wanted\nsquare, i.e. the ends of the sliding chord, which was a side of the wanted\nsquare.  The circle (B) with radius p touches the middle point of the side\nof the wanted square, i.e. curve (C-2) with centre on C-3.\n\nNow if the circle (A), with the centre point on curve C-3, cuts the original\nsmooth, closed convex curve C-1 in 4 points we have found a square, but not\nnecessarily a rectangular square.\nAnyway,  by choosing a certain length or p for the sliding chord, it would\nbe apparent that the centre of the circle (A) is found and also a kind of\nsquare is found.\n\nApparently, if circle (A) with radius p*sqrt(2) rolls on the outside of the\nsmooth convex curve C-3, it is possible to draw a new smooth convex curve\nC-4 that is at the radius distance (p*sqrt(2)) from the curve C-3. Iff now\nthe curves C-1 and C-4 have four common point, a square is found, but not\nnecessarily a rectangular square. The common points of the curves C-4 and\nC-2 may help, but the proof that the solution is a rectangular square is not\nso easy.\n\nThe above mentioned \"story\" how to find the centre of the circle (A) is not\na proof. I think it would be hopefully a method to find the proof for some p\nand for some curve C-1.\nThe method and the proof that the wanted square is rectangular square is far\naway.\n\nAt least - you may received a tip for further studies - hopefully.\n\nTapio\n\nOriginal poster continues:\n|Now,  if the new closed curve has a perpendicular section (with itself) ,\n|i.e. a knot-point, then there is a single point for the wanted square.\n|Therefore - If it is possible to proof that such a point exists as a\n|function of p or q, then the problem is proofed (?).\n|\n|Hopefully....\n|\n|Tapio\n|\n|David Eppstein wrote in message &lt;7lgd3g$ci5@euclid.ics.uci.edu&gt;...\n||Bob Silverman &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:bobs@rsa.com\">bobs@rsa.com</A>&gt; writes:\n||&gt; BTW, does anyone know if any progress has been made on the following\n||&gt; problem: On every Jordan curve there exists 4 points lying on the\n||&gt; vertices of a square.\n||\n||Last I heard it was still open, although some cases (e.g. sufficiently\n||smooth curves) have been solved.

We can embed this\n&gt;annulus geometrically as the set {(a,b): 1 &lt; a^2+b^2 &lt; 2} in such a way\n&gt;that that swapping x and y corresponds to a 180degree rotation of the\n&gt;annulus: -(a,b) = (-a,-b) ....\n\nI am wondering how to embed the annulus so as to meet that condition.\n\nIt seems to me that near either annulus boundary, x is very close to y\n(with one boundary having x just \"before\" y on the curve, and the other\nboundary having x just \"after\" y on the curve, where we imagine the\ncurve as having an arbitrary \"before\"/\"after\" orientation).\n\nTherefore, if you swap x and y for some point (a,b) near a boundary, you\nmust get a point near the other boundary, whereas the opposite point (-a,-b)\nwould be near the same boundary.

But this is not true, for \ninstance, when the curve is a circle.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "KOI8-R"}
