These will usually involve some reading and a few short problems to introduce you to a topic and help prepare you to ask questions and work in the lab the following week. </font></li>\n  <li><font face=\"Garamond\">Lab Assignments, which you will do in pairs and submit electronically at the end of your lab session the following Friday. </font></li>\n</ul>\n<p><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">The first week's lab assignment is very short so you can complete it at the first lab session on Monday, September 28.</FONT></p>\n<p><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">The lab  assignments will require you to do pair programming:\n  You and a classmate will work together at one computer, following <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/pair.html\">specific guidelines</a>.  This makes the scheduled lab\n  hours on Monday/Wednesday/Friday particularly valuable as a time when everyone\n  in the class (and the TA) is certain to be available.</FONT></p>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">We encourage you to talk with each other and\nhelp each other understand how to do the assignments.  There are some limits,\nthough.  Everyone should read the  <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/collab.html\">guidelines for collaboration and independent work</A>.</FONT></P>\n<OL TYPE=\"1\">\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">Setup and HtDP Chapters 1-2, <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/lab0.html\">Lab Assignment 0</a> (due at the end of lab on September 25); <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/h21/hw/hw1.html\">First Homework</A>\n  (show your work to the TA at the start of lab on September 28);  <A HREF=\"http://eee.uci.edu/09f/37000/hwans/hw1ans.txt\">Solutions</A> to\nmost of the HtDP exercises from the homework (not the lab assignment) are available\non line; you need to log in using </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=2>i41</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"> and the password we will give you in class.
