This assessment will be done by \nrandomly checking mastery of some subset of the skills and tasks and will\nbe confirmed by the person being checked sending e-mail with the subject\n\"X OKed this\" to ics1c@ics.uci.edu, where \"X\" is the name of the person\ndoing the checking.  The body of the e-mail message should be the\nics1c/hot.w3.html file described below in the last supplementary task.\n\nHere are the supplementary tasks:\n   1) Create a hotlist with at least 10 reasonably named entries.\n      This list should include at least the following URL:\n\t <A HREF=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/\">http://www.oac.uci.edu/</A>\n\t <A HREF=\"http://ea.oac.uci.edu/\">http://ea.oac.uci.edu/</A>\n\t <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/</A>\n      and your own ics1c directory which you can access by using the\n      \"Open Local ...\" option under the \"File\" menu at the top left\n      of Mosaic's Document View Window.\n   2) Use the \"Save as ...\" option under the \"File\" menu in Mosaic\n      to save in your \"ics1c\" both the \"Plain Text\" and HTML version\n      of any (short) HTML file you find of interest.\n\t BEWARE: You may have to make the \"Save Document\" window a bit\n\t   wider in order to have the button at the right end of the \n\t   \"Format for saved document:\" line appear so that you can\n\t   click on it with the left mouse button to see the choices\n\t   of format for saving the file.\n      The name of the HTML version of the what you save should end\n      in \".html\" as in \"sample.html\"\n      Use pico (or another text editor) to examine both the \"Plain Text\" \n      and HTML versions of the file you have saved and then use the\n      \"Open Local ...\" Option on Mosaic's File menu to examine both.\n   3) Using the \"Mail To\" button on the \"Hotlist View\" window\n      (select \"Hotlist\" from the \"Navigate\" Menu), mail a copy of your\n      hotlist to yourself.  Next, put a copy of this mail to your \"ics1c\"\n      directory under the name \"hot.w3.html\" and edit this file to remove\n      the mail headers.  Finally, use \"Open Local...\" under Mosaic's\n      \"File\" menu to view this file (\"ics1c/hot.w3.html\") within Mosaic.\n=========================================================================\n</PRE>\n<!--X-MsgBody-End-->\n<!--X-Follow-Ups-->\n<!--X-Follow-Ups-End-->\n<!--X-References-->\n<!--X-References-End-->\n<!--X-BotPNI-->\n<HR>\n<UL>\n<LI>Prev: <STRONG><A HREF=\"msg00005.html\">ICS 1C Lab Schedule 26-30 January</A></STRONG></LI>\n<LI>Next: <STRONG><A HREF=\"msg00003.html\">ICS 1C Labs, Teams, and Quiz 1</A></STRONG></LI>\n<LI>Index: <STRONG><A HREF=\"maillist.html#00004\">Mail Index</A></STRONG></LI>\n</UL>\n<!--X-BotPNI-End-->\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
