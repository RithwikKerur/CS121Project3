We show that for any set of strings S the complexity of sorting\nS can naturally be expressed in terms of the trie induced by S. This\nholds not only for lower bounds but also for the running times of\nvarious algorithms. Thus this &ldquo;data specific&rdquo; analysis allows\na direct comparison of different algorithms running on the same data. We\ngive such &ldquo;data-specific&rdquo; analyses for various versions of\nquicksort and versions of mergesort. As a corollary we arrive at a very\nsimple analysis of quicksorting random strings, which so far required\nrather sophisticated mathematical tools. As part of this we provide\ninsights in the analysis of tries of random strings which may be\ninteresting in their own right.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"http://www.siam.org/proceedings/soda/2010/SODA10_102_seidelr.pdf\">a paper by Raimund Seidel</a> at SODA 2010.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
