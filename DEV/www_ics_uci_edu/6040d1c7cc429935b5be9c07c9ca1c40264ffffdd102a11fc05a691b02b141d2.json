If squares sharing sides\nare defined as adjacent, we color balanced quadtrees with three\ncolors, and unbalanced quadtrees with four colors; these results\nare both tight, as some quadtrees require this many colors. If\nsquares sharing corners are defined as adjacent, we color balanced\nor unbalanced quadtrees with six colors; for some quadtrees, at\nleast five colors are required.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
