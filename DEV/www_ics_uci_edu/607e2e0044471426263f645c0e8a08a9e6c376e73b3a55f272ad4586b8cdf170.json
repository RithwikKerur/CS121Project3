An opaque locator at one \nlevel becomes a structured locator for the one below. A popular web \nbrowser, for example, allows URLs to be typed into an \"Address\" \nfield; but in turn that URL is decomposed and resolved against \nseveral more namespaces, such as scheme, host name, and path. This \nproceeds recursively down to Ethernet hardware IDs and port numbers; \nand all the way up to identifying human beings and vocabularies.\n \n<p>\n\nInspired by the classic Eames film, \"Powers of Ten\", this talk begins \nat an airline reservation page and zooms in and out to introduce a \nhost of Internet-scale namespaces embedded within an everyday \napplication. Furthermore, we will describe several distributed \nresolution strategies, from Domain Name System to Address Resolution \nProtocol. Finally, we attempt to identify the cross-cutting issues to \ngo beyond merely mechanical scaling to large numbers of names, to \nreach Internet-scale: architectures that work across organizations, \nacross space, and across time.\n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/twist/twist99/\">\nTWIST 99</a>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
