As an honors series, these courses\nwill cover a broader and deeper set of topics than the corresponding conventional\ncourses.  The concepts we will cover transcend the details of particular\nprogramming languages, but ICS H21 will use primarily Scheme ICS H22\nand H23 will move on to Java.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>ICS H21 is an exciting course because of the\nmany horizons it broadens.  We welcome you, and we hope you enjoy it.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  This course\ndoes not expect any previous experience in computer science or computer\nprogramming.  If you do have some experience, you will find some topics\nfamiliar but many others will certainly be new to you.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>We do expect each student to be able to navigate\nthe Windows XP systems in our labs, to navigate the World-Wide Web, to download\nand read documents in Adobe Acrobat (pdf) format, and to read and send electronic\nmail. Some of our assignments will require these skills.  If you need to\npick these skills up or sharpen them, you should do it in the first week\nof the quarter.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>Meeting place and times:  </B>Lecture meets\nTuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 to 10:50 in 1500 Donald Bren Hall. Discussion and lab\nsection meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 to 2:50, \nin 192 ICS.  Your lab work will be done in\npairs, so the scheduled lab times are the best times to work with\nyour partner.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>Office hours:  </B>You are welcome to drop\nby my office at any time.  If I'm there and not immersed in something\nelse, I&#39;ll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics.\n I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours,\nduring which course-related matters will have first priority:  Tuesdays from 1:00 to 1:45 and Wednesdays\nfrom 2:15 to 2:45; I may adjust these times at the end of the first week. Of course emergencies\nmay come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change. We&#39;ll\nalso be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't blow it off without getting in touch).

Expect to refer back\nto the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about\nwhat&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure\nto read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required; professional\nprogrammers plan on paper prior to starting to type.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>Start each assignment early.  Assignments\nwill be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly\nevery day.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it\nwill, even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early,\nyou&#39;ll have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>\n\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>If you find yourself having trouble or getting\nbehind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  We have lots of ways to help.\n But never take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and turning\nit in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on a lab\nassignment.  ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more complete\ndiscussion, see the ICS departmental web page covering academic honesty\nissues (</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php</code></A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>).\n</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>Turn in whatever portion of the assignment\nyou have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something\nrather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances\nyou may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after it&#39;s\ndue, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date comes.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>Always keep your own copy of each assignment,\nboth electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the shuffle\n(or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened), we&#39;ll\nexpect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>Approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n\n<TABLE WIDTH=100% height=\"604\" BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0>\n<COL WIDTH=9%><COL WIDTH=18%><COL WIDTH=73%>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=9% VALIGN=TOP>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><U>Week</U></FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><U>Date</U></FONT><BR></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=74% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><U>Topic (and chapters in HtDP)</U>*</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n  <TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
