It is easy to see that vf(X) does not\ndepend on the location of the origin. \n\nDefine the packing fraction for hoops in R^3 to be the number\n\n\t\tpf = sup( vf(X) ) \n\nwhere the sup is over all hooped measurable sets X in R^3 for\nwhich vf exists.\n\nQUESTION:\tDoes anyone know of any results on determining\nthe packing fraction for hoops in R^3 ?  \n\n(I have found that it is over 70 percent.)\n\nDaniel Asimov\n<A HREF=\"mailto:asimov@nas.nasa.gov\">asimov@nas.nasa.gov</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
