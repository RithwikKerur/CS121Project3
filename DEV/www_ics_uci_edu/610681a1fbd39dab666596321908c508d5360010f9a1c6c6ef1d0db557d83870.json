By putting the appropriate control lines in\n<tt>pubs.ff</tt>, the same publication list can be given\nmany different appearances.\n<P>\nEventually I hope to do this filtering automatically, as pages are\nrequested, via the CGI interface to the WWW.\nHowever until some security questions are resolved,\nI am currently using a <A HREF=\"pubs.sh\">shell script</A>\nto generate separate files for each view of my publication list.\n<P>\nAdvantages of this method include:\n<UL>\n<LI>Replacing a large file with many small pages of more focused text \nleads to better hit rates from web search engines.\n<LI>It is easy to maintain a site with hundreds of pages,\nsince to add a page I merely have to add a few lines with that\nkeyword to the source file.\n<LI>When I get new information or change existing parts of my files,\nI only have to change one file instead of finding all places\nwhere the information is replicated.  This is especially useful\nfor my publications, in which one paper is typically listed\nin a half-dozen or so pages.\n<LI>In web documents consisting of many related pages, all are formatted\nconsistently with each other, and formatting is easy to change for all\npages at once.\n<LI>It is easy to maintain a list of\nrecently added entries.  The filter program provides a mechanism\nfor comment lines recording the date, and to remove entries from the recent\nlist I need merely remove that keyword line from the file.\n</UL>\n<P>\n\n<HR><P>\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/software.html\">Downloadable software</A> by\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A><BR>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"filter.html\" --></SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
