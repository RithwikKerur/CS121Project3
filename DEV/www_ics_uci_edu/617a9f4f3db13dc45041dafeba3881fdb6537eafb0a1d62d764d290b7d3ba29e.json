Next are the scores for your\rlabs and their total, weighted by the fraction of the total lab grade each\rlab was worth. \rNote that scores above 4 count as a kind of extra credit &#151;\r4 points is considered 100% of the possible points for a lab. Then come two columns that help in calculating your adjusted lab score, followed by that adjusted score. For details on how this is computed, see the Course Reference; if you are curious how your grader ranked, see the TA chart off to the right of main grade sheet. \r\r<p>Next is your midterm and final exam scores.  Then appears the\rcourse total; it was computed out of 100 points, weighted to the values\rwe published in the Course Reference.\r\r<p>Your letter grade appears next; if you are taking the class P/NP, the Registrar will change your grade to P or NP as appropriate. Sometimes, instead of a grade, you'll see the notation \"NR\"--Grade Not Recorded--because\rthere are pending issues that must be resolved before a grade can be given;\rif you see an \"NR\" grade for yourself and have not yet contacted me, do so!\r\r<p>Do check over your scores; if you find any which are incorrect because of a clerical or procedural error and <i>that\rwould change your final grade</i>, contact me by email (my schedule\rduring sumemer tends to be erratic). Note the only reasons for which I can change a grade are if a procedural or clerical error occurred#151;UCI rules.\r\r<p>The posted spreadsheet also shows some statistics on the course and\rcoursework that might interest you; these stats are at the bottom of the main speadsheet and also to the right of the main sheet.\r\r<p>I will hold onto your midterm and final exam Scantron sheets into the first\rcouple of weeks of next quarter, in case you have questions.\r\r<p>My best wishes an enjoyable break!\r<p>Norm\r\r\r</body>\r</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
