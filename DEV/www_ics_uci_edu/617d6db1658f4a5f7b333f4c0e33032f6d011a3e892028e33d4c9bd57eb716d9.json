There are some tips, however, that might make the search somewhat easier.<br />\n<br />\r\n\nThe 1869 Census was a general census of the population of the Kingdom of Hungary unlike the 1848 and others that appear in our records, which only enumerated Jews.  In most of the counties, Jewish records are interspersed with non-Jews but this is not the case for Saros.  A shortcut to the Saros Jewish records is to go to the list of municipalities in Saros megye at <a href=\"https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QSQ-G99V-V3R3?owc=QZ77-B8P%3A323642201%3Fcc%3D1986782&amp;wc=QZ77-BVC%3A323642201%2C323978501&amp;cc=1986782\">https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:3QSQ-G99V-V3R3?owc=QZ77-B8P%3A323642201%3Fcc%3D1986782&amp;wc=QZ77-BVC%3A323642201%2C323978501&amp;cc=1986782</a> and look for the records identified as (Zsido).  <br />\n<br />\r\n\nTo make this more confusing, what we identify as family numbers seem to bear no relationship that I can find to any number in the original records. I would be grateful to anyone who worked on indexing these records who can explain where the numbers originated.<br />\n<br />\n\r\nWhen searching linked images, it is possible to reduce the time spent <br />\r\n\nbrowsing by finding the Item # and determining about where the records for the relevant appear. The most recent query concerned a family from Zboro, Saros. <br /><br />\r\n\nThere are 489 images for Item #2 with a list of places in the beginning on image 95 at at the end on image 584.  If you go directly to Item #2 using link in the Saros records, the list is on Image 2.   The list shows that records from Zboro mezo varos, the town name,  appear in the last third of the records starting at image 397 (304 using direct method). <br />\n<br />\n\r\nThe records for each house covered at least 4 pages in the original census record or 3 images. The cover sheet lists the House Number and describes the building including number and type of rooms and whether the building included a shop, stable, etc.  The names, birth places, occupations, etc. appear on the second page of each house record. The last page, which is on the left side of the image with the cover sheet for the next house, includes interesting info about livestock and agricultural resources owned by the family. I was intrigued to learn that my great-grandfather had a store in the building where the family lived and quite a few farm animals, crops, etc.<br />\n<br />\r\n\n\r\nPlease contact me off list with comments and I'll post those of general interest.<br />\n<br />\r\n\nVivian Kahn<br />\r\nOakland, CA<br />\r\n\nJewishGen Hungarian SIG Coordinator<br />\r\n\n&lt;vkahn@kmort.com&gt;<br />\n<br />\r\n\nResearching families including:<br />\r\n\nBAL/BERKOVICS/BERKOWITZ/ROTH/GROSZ.
