An arrow labeled \"a/b,D\" means that if the machine sees the \ncharacter \"a\", it replaces it by \"b\", moves in direction D (either left \nor right), and changes state as indicated by the arrow.  An arrow labeled \nby \"a/accept\" or \"a/reject\" means the machine halts and accepts or rejects \nthe string as indicated.  The unlabeled arrow indicates the start state.\nA dash indicates the blank character.\n\n<CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"hw4tm.gif\">\n</CENTER>\n\n<OL>\n<P><LI>Indicate for each of the following strings whether the machine above \naccepts, rejects, or goes into an infinite loop without halting: 01, 10, \n011, 001, 0011.\n\n<P><LI>Find a Turing machine that accepts strings of 0's and 1's only when the \nnumber of 1's is a power of two.\n\n<P><I>(Hint: repeatedly pass left-to-right \nacross the string to test whether there is exactly one \"1\" left, and \nright-to-left across the string changing every other \"1\" into a \"0\").</I>\n\n<P><LI>Why is it impossible to prove Church's thesis mathematically?\n</OL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
