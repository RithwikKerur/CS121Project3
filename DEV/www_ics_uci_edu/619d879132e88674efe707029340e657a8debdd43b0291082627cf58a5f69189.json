Dan Asimov asks how large a triangle will fit into a\nsquare torus; equivalently, the densest packing of equilateral triangles\nin the pattern of a square lattice.\nThere is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to\nthe lattice vectors; <A HREF=\"tripack.html\">my answer</A>\nis that the densest packing occurs when\nthis angle is 15 or 45 degrees, <A HREF=\"tripack.ps\">shown below</A>.\n(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density\n2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see F&aacute;ry,\nBull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)\n\n<P>Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least\none point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle\nsuch that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,\nthey always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel\nand 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides\nand contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.\n\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=\"tripack.gif\" WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=273></DIV><P>\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/packing.html\">Erich's\nPacking Page</A>.

Daniel\nAsimov asks what fraction of 3-dimensional space can be filled by a\ncollection of disjoint unit circles.  (It may not be obvious that this\nfraction is nonzero, but a standard construction allows one to construct\na solid torus out of circles, and one can then pack tori to fill space,\nleaving some uncovered gaps between the tori.)
