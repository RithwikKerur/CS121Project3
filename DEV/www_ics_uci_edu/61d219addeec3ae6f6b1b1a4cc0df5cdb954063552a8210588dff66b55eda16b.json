Richardson, T. Owen O'Malley, Cindy Tittle Moore and\nStephanie Lief Aha in\n<i> Proceedings of ACM SIGSOFT Fifth Symposium on Software\nDevelopment Environments,</i>\npages 109-119, Tyson's Corner, VA, December 1992.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nProDAG is an analysis toolset that provides an application programmatic \ninterface for program dependence analysis. Program dependences are \nsyntactic relationships between program statements. The ProDAG interface \nprovides a uniform set of operations for creating and accessing several \npre-defined dependence relations, which are represented as graphs, as \nwell as a standard mechanism for developing new dependence graphs. ProDAG \nis one analysis toolset in Arcadia.  ProDAG was developed in the Arcadia \nenvironment and has been integrated with the language processing, object \nmanagement, and process definition components of the Arcadia architecture,\nand further integration with the user interface development system and \nthe measurement and evaluation components are underway. This paper \ndescribes the design, implementation and integration of ProDAG within \nArcadia. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:38:59 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
