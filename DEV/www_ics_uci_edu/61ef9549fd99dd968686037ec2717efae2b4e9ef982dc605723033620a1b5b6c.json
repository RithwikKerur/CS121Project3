One\n&gt;condition is that all the faces be quads, i.e., have four\n&gt;edges. What are the other conditions? Note, for example, that\n&gt;it is possible to mesh a tetrahedron with hexes, but not\n&gt;without modifying its faces, i.e., adding vertices. \n&gt;\n&gt;Any help would be appreciated. \n&gt;   Mac Casale\n&gt;   <A HREF=\"mailto:casale@pda.com\">casale@pda.com</A>\n\nHexahedron here means combinatorially equivalent to a cube.\nThis can be taken as a question in combinatorial topology,\nwhere the faces can be curvilinear, or one can insist that\nthe hexahedra really have linear faces.   Let's look at\nthe topological question first.\n\nOne way to view this problem is to dualize, that is, take\nthe dual subdivision.   The dual of a cell division of the\nsphere by quadrilaterals\nis characterized by the property that edges meet in 4's.  You\ncan think of it as a subdivision of the sphere obtained by\ndrawing some possibly self-intersecting  closed curves that meet\nthemselves and meet each other transversely.  This is like\na knot or link projection.   \n\nA hexahedral cell division of the ball is dual to a subdivision\nobtained by a collection of surfaces inside the ball, intersecting\ntransverely.  \n\nEach double curve (where a surface intersects itself) has to either\nbe closed, or meet the boundary in two points.  So a necessary condition\nis that there be an even number of quadrilaterals.  (There do exist\nconvex polyhedra with an odd number of quadrilateral sides, so\nthis is a nonvacuous condition.)\n\nGiven a system of curves that does have an even number of self-intersections,\nit is possible to find a surface with transveral self-intersections having\nthe system of curves as its boundary.  (not necessarily dual to\na hexahedral decomposition yet though, at this point).\nFirst, a simple closed curve bounds a disk.  Second, if there is any\npair of self-intersections connected by an arc on the system of\ncurves, you can pair them up with a double line of surface, and\nreduce the problem to one with two fewer double points.  The only\nremaining possibility is that each component of the curve is\na figure eight.  You can connect any two such together.\n\nThis gives a way to construct the surface with boundary the given\ncurves.  It may not be dual to a hexahedral decomposition, because\nfor instance there may be no interior vertices (corresponding to\nhexahedra) at all.   So, add a bunch of spheres with enough intersection\npoints with the existing surface to make lots of interior vertices.\nThis turns it into the dual of a hexahedral decomposition.\n\nThis answers the topological question.\n****\nAs for the geometric question:  My first guess is it can be done\ngeometrically if it can be done topologically, but it\nlooks very tricky.  If you're using curvilinear coordinates, then\nit's irrelevant.  Which question are you really trying to answer?\n\nIt is known that any\ncombinatorial subdivision of the sphere into quadrilaterals can\nbe realized by a convex polyhedron; one strategy would be first\nto try to show everything can be gotten into convex form (by constructing\nquadrilateral-cross-section tubes), then analyzing further obstructions.\n\nBy the way, one easy construction for certain hexahedral decompositions:\na tetrahedron divides into 4 hexahedra, so if you start with something\nwith triangulated boundary and divide into quadrilateals, you can\nalways extend it.\n\n\tBill Thurston\n</PRE>\n<HR><P>\nPart of\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/geom.html\">Geometry in Action</A>,\na collection of applications of computational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"Thurston-hexahedra.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
