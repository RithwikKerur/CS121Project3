Software development and operational\nuse are therefore dominated by human action, human judgment\nand decision making, and inevitably human error.\nThe outcome is, therefore, often uncertain and unpredictable\nand, along with uncertainty in natural phenomena, leads to\nunavoidable software uncertainties.\nMost if not all software failures are experienced by or\notherwise affect human users.  Similarly, most software\ndefects can be traced to human origins, be it an error\nintroduced directly by a developer or a defect that is\nonly indirectly human-related.  An IEEE software\nengineering standard, for example, identifies two key\nsources of software uncertainty as ``poor knowledge\nor understanding of the problem domain'' and\n``insufficient, untimely orientation to user needs and to\noverall quality''&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#IEEE9822\">IEE94</A>].\n<P>\nThe observation\nthat ``software engineering is fraught with uncertainty''\nis often used to explain the known symptoms of the\nsoftware crisis, including high costs and unexpected\nslips in development schedule as well as unpredictable\nfailures of operational software.  The abundance of\nuncertainty also justifies extensive measures taken\nby researchers and practitioners attempting to identify\nand alleviate software risks and uncertainties.\n<P>\nWhile software risk management has long been an active\nfield of research producing significant contributions\n(cf.&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#Boehmriskbook\">Boe89</A>, <A HREF=\"node6.html#Boehmriskpaper\">Boe91</A>]), the subject\nof software uncertainties has largely been overlooked,\nwith the notable exception of software reliability\nmodels&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#littlewood79\">Lit79</A>] and models for validation\nof software dependability&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#Littlewoodcacm\">LS93</A>].\nThis omission is particularly surprising in light of\nextensive research in modeling and management of\nuncertainty carried out in Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) domains (cf.&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#Pearl88\">Pea88</A>, <A HREF=\"node6.html#Neapolitan90\">Nea90</A>, <A HREF=\"node6.html#cacmuncertainty\">HMW95</A>]).\n<P>\nThus, despite the pervasiveness of human involvement\nand related software uncertainties, surprisingly few\nattempts have been made to model those uncertainties\nexplicitly.  This dissertation aims to remedy this\nsituation, initially by presenting the Maxim of \nUncertainty in Software Engineering (MUSE) and as\na corollary, urging that\nsoftware uncertainties be modeled directly, using\nan appropriate uncertainty modeling technique.\n<P>\nIdeally, an uncertainty modeling technique should include\nprobabilistic notions of uncertainty and confidence,\nprovide for multiple sources of evidence and influence,\nand support dynamic updating of uncertainty values during\nsoftware development.  In this dissertation, we claim\nthat Bayesian Belief Networks meet these desiderata and\nare therefore suitable for software uncertainty modeling.\n<P>\nThere are many perceived benefits of modeling software\nuncertainty, including, among others:\n<OL><LI>\nUncertainty permeates software development, yet is generally\nabsent in most software models.  A model providing explicit\nrepresentation of software uncertainties would therefore be\nmore accurate (and possibly more useful) than one where\nuncertainties are disregarded.<LI>\nThe search for uncertainty plays a pivotal role in an overall\nsoftware risk management strategy.  Following\nGemmer&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#Gemmerrisk\">Gem97</A>], ``It is impossible to manage risk\nwithout ferreting out elements of uncertainty.  Uncertainty\nis present in all decisions we face.''  A key risk\nminimization activity is to ``systematically search for\nuncertainty wherever it may be.''<LI>\nFinally, software uncertainty modeling may help guide and \nultimately improve software process decisions.  Based on\nchanges and fluctuations in software uncertainty levels, \nfor example, a project manager may decide to ``conclude\ntesting,'' ``instigate regression testing,'' or else\n``shuffle testing priorities.''  \n</OL>\n<P>\nWe generally believe that software uncertainty modeling\nholds promise for improved human understanding and decision\nmaking in a wide range of development activities.  In this\ndissertation, however, we focus on specific benefits of\nuncertainty modeling for specific development situations.\nTo this end, we describe several premises and propose a\nspecific research hypothesis to be validated against a\nreal software project.  The premises and hypothesis for\nthis dissertation are described next.\n<P>\n<HR><A NAME=\"tex2html32\" HREF=\"node3.html\"><IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"next\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/next_motif.gif\"></A> <A NAME=\"tex2html30\" HREF=\"node1.html\"><IMG WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"up\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/up_motif.gif\"></A> <A NAME=\"tex2html24\" HREF=\"node1.html\"><IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"previous\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/previous_motif.gif\"></A>   <BR>\n<B> Next:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html33\" HREF=\"node3.html\">Premises and Hypothesis</A>\n<B>Up:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html31\" HREF=\"node1.html\">Introduction</A>\n<B> Previous:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html25\" HREF=\"node1.html\">Introduction</A>\n<P><ADDRESS>\n<I>Hadar Ziv <BR>\nFri Jun 20 16:22:31 PDT 1997</I>\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
