The authors propose a new sparse (1+&epsilon;)-spanner with\nO(n/&epsilon;<sup>d</sup>) edges, where &epsilon; is a specified\nparameter. This spanner can be efficiently maintained under dynamic\ninsertion or deletion of points, as well as under continuous motion of\nthe points in both the kinetic data structures setting and in the more\nrealistic blackbox displacement model they introduce.  Deformable\nspanners succinctly encode all proximity information in a deforming\npoint cloud, giving us efficient kinetic algorithms for problems such as\nthe closest pair, the near neighbors of all points, approximate nearest\nneighbor search (aka approximate Voronoi diagram), well-separated pair\ndecomposition, and approximate k-centers.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
