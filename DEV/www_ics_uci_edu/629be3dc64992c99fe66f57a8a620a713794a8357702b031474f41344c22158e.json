We give such\nself-improving algorithms for sorting and for computing Delaunay\ntriangulations. Each algorithm begins with a training phase during which\nit adjusts itself to the input distribution, followed by a stationary\nregime in which the algorithm settles to its optimized incarnation. We\nshow that in both cases, in the stationary regime, the algorithms run as\nfast as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\nJoint work with Nir Alon, Bernard Chazelle, Ding Liu, C.
