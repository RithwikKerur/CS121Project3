The algorithm uses local routing tables of\nsize O(n2/3log4/3n) and achieves paths that are most 3 times the\nlength of the shortest path distances for all nodes in an arbitrary\nweighted undirected network. This answers an open question of\nGavoille and Gengler who showed that any universal compact routing\nalgorithm with maximum stretch strictly less than 3 must use W(n)\nlocal space at some vertex. \n\n<p></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
