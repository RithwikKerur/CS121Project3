Given m, for approximately what range(s) of n is there at least a 50% probability that n balls thrown into m bins will be smooth?\n\n2. Prove that, for almost all graphs drawn from the G(n,1/2) distribution, every vertex is within distance two of every other vertex. (Here, \"almost all\" means \"with probability that goes to zero as n goes to infinity\". Hint: use Markov's inequality on the expected number of pairs that are not at distance two.)\n\n3. Recall that a random regular graph is with high probability an expander graph, meaning that for some constant c, with high probability, every subset S of the vertices of the graph has at least (c/n) |S| |V\\S| neighbors, where V\\S is the complementary set to S. Prove from this property that every two vertices are at distance at most O(log n) from each other.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
