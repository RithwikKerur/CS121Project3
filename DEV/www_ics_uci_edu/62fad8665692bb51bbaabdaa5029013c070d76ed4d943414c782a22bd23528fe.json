Moreover, if the original proof system is statistical zero\nknowledge, so is the resulting efficient-prover proof system. An\nequivalence of zero knowledge and efficient-prover zero knowledge was\npreviously known only under the assumption that one-way functions exist\nand no such equivalence was known for statistical zero knowlege.\n<p>\n(from STOC 2006)\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
