but,\r\n  it will move at a quick pace, so be prepared to work hard.\r\nThe intellectual content of this coures can be neatly divided into three \r\n  main subject areas: Algorithmics, Abstraction, and Analysis (the triple-As):\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Algorithmics: types, literals, variables/state/references, expressions,\r\n          exceptions, and control structures.\r\n    <li>Abstraction: constants, compound types (interfaces and classes\r\n          -including array classes), methods, libraries, inheritance\r\n          (including polymorphism), collection classes, and reflection.\r\n     <li>Analysis: pragmatics, aesthetics (style), correctness\r\n          (testing/debugging), efficiency (big-O notation), and numerical\r\n          accuracy.\r\n   </ul>  \r\n<p>\r\nThis course emphasizes Object Oriented Programming (OOP).\r\nThe foundational unit of OOP is the <i>class</i>: a syntactic structure that\r\n  describes and encapsulates both the behavior (methods implemented by control\r\n  structures) and state (fields implementing data structures) of objects.\r\nClasses provide an excellent motivation and context for exploring most\r\n  interesting aspects of programming.\r\nWe can view software as a collection of interacting objects, which are\r\n   constructed from classes; often with many objects constructed from\r\n   the same class.\r\n<p>\r\nThe main programming methodology that we will learn and employ is\r\n   iterative-enhancement, which decomposes a large project into a series of\r\n   mini-projects (each is called a phase).\r\nStarting from a kernel, and writing a program for each of these phases in\r\n   sequence, results in a solution to the original project.\r\nEach phase requires repeatedly specifying, designing, coding, documenting,\r\n   testing, debugging, and evaluating a testable program that is a small\r\n   extension of the capabilities of the program produced in the previous phase.\r\nSometimes we will use JUnit to devise tests for our code, and then\r\n  automatically test it (and retest it when we make changes).\r\n<p>\r\nJava is a medium-sized language that includes a very large library: beginning\r\n   programmers cannot learn all of it in a quarter.\r\nWith this in mind, this course (and ICS-22/-23) is designed to teach you the\r\n  fundamentals of Java as well as how to learn a programming language, so that\r\n  you can learn additional Java language or library features (or another\r\n  language) later, on your own.\r\nIn particular, we will study and use tools for browsing, debugging, and\r\n  documenting large programs.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough we will mostly study <i>programming-in-the-small</i>, we will\r\n  concentrate on the technical and lingual issues of building large,\r\n  reliable programmed systems that are constructed from standard components.\r\nExpect to cover most relevant Java language features thoroughly, but also\r\n  to spend much time discussing the less concrete -but ultimately more\r\n  general and important- aspects of programming.\r\nProgramming style is a particularly important topic: to understand\r\n  programming, we really need to develop appropriate aesthetics that allow\r\n  us to separate \"elegant\" programs from \"hacks\".\r\nAs in any writing activity, we must also learn to be self-critical of our own\r\n  creations, so that we can continually improve them; this skill is difficult\r\n  to acquire, and its importance extends well beyond the domain of\r\n  programming.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, to become an expert in any discipline, we must master its\r\n   terminology.\r\nFluency with technical terms allows us to communicate -and even to think-\r\n   more accurately and concisely.\r\nTherefore, the materials in this course will define, illustrate, and\r\n   repeatedly use many important technical terms concerning programming.\r\nTake the time required to master them. An old Chinese proverb says,\r\n     \"The first step towards wisdom is calling things by their right names.\" \r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Textbook -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Textbook\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>. \r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Textbooks</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThe primary materials for this course will come from web pages that I have\r\n  written (and am continually updating).\r\nThese web pages include readings, problem sets, and programming assignments\r\n  (and a bunch of infrastructure material, like this syllabus).\r\nTypically, these web pages will be shorter than chapters in a textbook, but\r\n  they are more densely packed with information; thus, you will still spend\r\n  about the same amount of time studying my web pages as you would reading a\r\n  textbook.\r\n<p>\r\n<!--\r\nThe UCI Bookstore will sell two textbooks that traditionally are used \r\n  throughout the ICS-21/-22/-23 course sequence.\r\nIf you took ICS 21 here, you will probably have the first book already, which\r\n  contains much useful material about the fundamentals of Java (and covers\r\n  quite a few advanced topics as well).\r\n-->\r\nIf you don't have any textbook that discusses the Java programming language, I\r\n  recommend buying the book by Horstmann mentioned below; you can read it to\r\n  fill in any gaps in your knowledge of Java, and use it as a resource\r\n  in ICS-22/-23.\r\nThe other two books are also useful if you plan to work more with Java,\r\n  either by taking more classes at UCI or exploring Java by yourself.\r\n<p>\r\n  <ol>\r\n  <li><b>Horstmann</b>, <i>Java Concepts, 6th Edition</i>,\r\n       Wiley,\r\n       ~$100 new (~$50 used).\r\n  <li><b>Sestoft</b>, <i>Java Precisely SECOND EDITION</i>,\r\n       MIT Press, \r\n       ~$20 new (~$15 used)\r\n  <li><b>Vermeulen</b>, <i>The Elements of Java Style</i>,\r\n       SIGS Books/Cambridge University Press,\r\n       ~$15 (new) (~$6 used)\r\n  </ol>\r\n<!--\r\nThese prices are from the UCI bookstore.\r\n-->\r\nThese books are <!-also-> available new and used on the internet.\r\nSee <a href=\"http://www.directtextbook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  DirectTextbook</a>, which crawls the web for cheap prices.\r\nDon't forget to account for shipping costs and delivery time if you don't\r\n  buy from the UCI bookstore.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Computing Platforms and Programming Environments -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ComputingPlatform\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Computing Platforms and Programming Environments</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThe standard computing platforms for this course are\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Intel-based PCs running the Windows XP or Vista Operating System (OS).\r\n    <li>Macintosh PCs running the OS X operating system\r\n    <li>Either PC running Linux.\r\n  </ul>\r\n<p>\r\nProgramming courses at most schools are moving towards a model in which most\r\n  students use their own computers (or those of their roommates or friends) to\r\n  complete their programming assignments.\r\nAll the software used in ICS-21 is available, for free, on the web.\r\nWe are assuming that students have already installed a web browser, and have a\r\n  high-speed connection to the World-Wide Web: e.g., via the campus network or\r\n  a DSL line; having only a modem will make it more difficult, but not\r\n  impossible, to work off campus.\r\n  <p>\r\nThe programming environment that we will use is Eclipse (version 3.6.2, also\r\n   called Helios): it is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE),\r\n   including a project manager, editor, compiler, debugger, class browser,\r\n   help facility, etc.\r\nWe will also use the Sun Java version 1.6.24 compiler and runtime system with\r\n  this IDE.\r\nIn addition, realVNC (Virtual Network Computing) allows students on their own\r\n   computers to seek remote debugging help from a pool of course staff.\r\nThis software, and others useful for the course, are available through the\r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/online.html\">Online Resources</a>\r\n  link (see <b>Course Software</b>, near the top).\r\nWe will be happy to help you install this software on your portable,\r\n  if you can bring it to lab (or the instructor's office hours).\r\n<p>\r\nTalk to your instructor or TA immediately if you are experiencing any problems\r\n  with your computing platform.\r\nTypically it takes only a few days before everyone has correctly downloaded and\r\n  installed the necessary software, and learned how to use it properly.\r\nUsing this software is integral to every programming assignment during the\r\n  quarter, so it is best to be aggressive and download, install, and start\r\n  mastering this software quickly.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Computers -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Computers\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Computers:<br>ICS Labs</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nIn addition to using their own machines, students can do their coursework on\r\n  the machines in the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab\">ICS Labs</a>,\r\n  which are described on this link and in more detail below.\r\nThe main upside of using the ICS labs is that it will be easy to get ICS-21\r\n  staff to help you there; the main downside is that you will not be using\r\n  your own computer -unless you have a portable and bring it to the labs to\r\n  get the best of both worlds.\r\nRead the following to learn about \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/students/acct_activate.php\">\r\n ICS Lab Account Activation</a>.\r\nWhether or not you plan on doing your homework in a lab, you must activate your\r\n  ICS account and know how to use it for in-class programming exams.\r\n<p>\r\nICS-21 schedules required lab hours (to complement required lecture hours),\r\n  during which students can learn how to use software tools and work on their\r\n  programming assignments, all under the supervision of ICS-21 staff members.\r\n<p>\r\nThe lab in <b>ICS 364</b> is a general purpose lab in which no courses are\r\n  scheduled.\r\nIt is open to students on weekdays and weekends:\r\n   MTuWThT 8:00am - 10:00pm,\r\n   F 8:00am - 8:00pm,\r\n   and SaSu 12:00noon - 6:00pm.\r\nYou can examine the\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/lab_schedule/index.php\">\r\n  Lab Schedules</a> for all these labs.\r\n<p>\r\n<!--\r\nFor information about where and when ICS-21 staff members are in labs,\r\n check the\r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/handouts/helpschedule.html\">Help Schedule</a>.\r\nGenerally, ICS-21 staff will do all their out-of-lab consulting in ICS\r\n  364.\r\n<p>\r\n-->\r\nIf you find it inconvenient to use these labs, and would rather work from\r\n  your dorm room or off campus, ICS-21 staff will also provide more limited\r\n  online help through AOL Instant Messaging.\r\nIf you have installed realVNC on your computer, we will be able to monitor and\r\n  manipulate your computer directly from ours.\r\nWe will discuss the details of this system for help, and how to use it, early\r\n  in the quarter.\r\n<p>\r\nDuring in-class programming exams, you will have to write your programs on\r\n  the PCs in our labs, so you should plan acquire some knowledge of these\r\n  machines, even if you are using your own machine for all other coursework.\r\nOnce you start Eclipse, what computer you are on makes little difference:\r\n   PCs, Macs, and Linux systems operate similarly.\r\nFinally, although the machines in the ICS labs also provide some external\r\n  storage space (on a Unix system), it is an excellent idea to obtain some kind\r\n  of USB memory to back-up all the work you do, both on your own computer and\r\n  in our labs.\r\n<p>\r\nEvery quarter some students have storage problems (lose parts of their work)\r\n  that would be easily avoided if they backed-up their work regularly on their\r\n  own USB memory.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Office Hours -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"OfficeHours\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Instructor<br>Office Hours</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI welcome students, individually or in small groups, to come by and talk with\r\n  me during my Office Hours,\r\n<!-- (see the\r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/handouts/helpschedule.html\">Help Schedule</a>),\r\n-->\r\n  or whenever I happen to be in my office with the door open.\r\nIf we need to talk, but you cannot come during my office hours, please call\r\n   me so that we can arrange an alternative time to meet;

I know that this is asking a lot, but the payoff for\r\n  recognizing the situation and acting on it immediately is tremendous.\r\nThe primary reason that students fail to thrive in programming courses is that\r\n  they fall behind in their work -often because of what is initially a small\r\n  misunderstanding; but, because of the cumulative nature of this course,\r\n  even a small misunderstanding can quickly grow into a big one.\r\nOften, I can quickly diagnose and rectify such a problem one-on-one.\r\n<p>\r\nGetting help fast can critically affect your overall performance in\r\n  this course: many times I've seen students start performing one grade\r\n  level higher after coming in to get help during my office hours\r\n  (a typical visit lasts for about 20 minutes).\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Online Hours -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"OnlineHours\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Instructor<br>Online Hours</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI hold online hours every Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (most\r\n  programming assignments are due on Wednesday evening) and Thursday evenings\r\n  from 9:00pm-10:00pm.\r\nI will be logged  onto AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) as <b>richardepattis</b>\r\n  during these times.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you are not already a member of AIM \r\n  <a href=\"http://www.aim.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign Up</a> for\r\n  this service (it is free).\r\nUsing this system, you will be able to Instant Message me, as well as use\r\n   an audio (voice) connection if you have a headset with a microphone.\r\nYou can IM me with questions;

Sorry to bother you.\"\r\nThis works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners.\r\nOne university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.\r\nStudents with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before\r\n  they could speak to a human counselor. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>- B.

normally will not answer email sent after about 10:00pm until early the next\r\n  morning (but I'll typically answer it by the next morning).\r\nIf you have problems late at night \"problems that the staff cannot help\r\n  resolve\" please send me email summarizing your problems, and then go to work\r\n  on something else (or if it is really late, go to sleep).\r\nBy planning to finish assignments early, you can protect yourself against a big\r\n  problem that arises at night and cannot be fixed until the next day: you\r\n  really don't want to have to fix such a problem the night that an assignment\r\n  is due.\r\n<p>\r\nFor many problems -ones that are of general interest to the class- I would\r\n  prefer it if you would use a MessageBoard forum (see below) so everyone can\r\n  see the question and its answer.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, the Electronic Educational Environment (EEE) at UCI creates and\r\n  maintains course-wide mailing lists.\r\nI have created a \"merged\" mailing list for all my ICS 21 students (which also\r\n  includes those students signed up for CSE 21, both in the Sammueli School of\r\n  Engineering and the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science).\r\nAll members of our course (staff and students) can use this mailing list, whose\r\n  email address is <b>ics21-S12@classes.uci.edu</b>\r\nAll messages sent via this discussion list will be archived on the\r\n  <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/S12/16000/\" target=\"main\">\r\n  Email Archive</a> web page.\r\nMostly student-initiated questions/discussions should use the forums mentioned\r\n  below, but sometimes students can use this email list to inform the\r\n  instructor, staff, and other students about some timely issue: e.g.,\r\n  Checkmate not responding to program submissions.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Bboard -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Bboard\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\"

interest to many students in the\r\n  course, not just you), then you use one of the forums on the EEE\r\n  MessageBoard.\r\nThese forums allow students to ask questions (or start discussions) easily, as\r\n  well as supply answers (or participate in the discsussion further).\r\nFor example, if a lecture note, programming assignment, etc. contains unclear\r\n  (or even contradictory) information, post a note about it to the appropriate\r\n  forum, asking for a clarification.\r\nI, or someone from my staff will read and reply to whatever questions are\r\n  asked.\r\nIn fact, if you read a question on a forum, and know the answer -or generally\r\n  have something to contribute to the topic, I encourage you to to post a reply\r\n  to help resolve the problem even sooner.\r\nThus, you can use the forums to discuss any course materials out-of-class.\r\n<p>\r\nAgain, forums are appropriate for questions relevant to most students in the\r\n  course; directly email me (see above) for questions of a more\r\n  individualistic nature.\r\nObviously students should neither solicit nor post answers to take-home\r\n  quizzes, programming assignments, or anything else that would be interpreted\r\n  as academic misconduct (which is discussed in greater detail below).\r\n<p>\r\nIt is an excellent idea to check these forums whenever you are about to starg\r\n  doing coursework, to

above).\r\n-->\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- RATS \r\n<a name=\"RATS\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\"

using their own computers (in their dorm\r\n  rooms) to complete their coursework; or maybe they will use the computers of\r\n  roommates or  friends, but generally not computers in CMU clusters.\r\nTo facilitate getting debugging help while in your dorm room, we have created \r\n  RATS: Remote Access Tutoring System.\r\n<p>\r\nTo run RATS, you must first have downloaded and installed the VNC (Virtual\r\n  Network Computing) software on your computer\r\n  (available for downloading from the\r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/online.html\">Online Resources</a> page).\r\nWe suggest that you do this early in the quarter, when you download the\r\n  Code-Warrior IDE and Java.\r\nThe best web links and instructions for downloading all these products is on\r\n  the <a href=\"../../../common/handouts/installation.html\">Installing Course Software</a> page.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you want to seek help from the 15-100 or 15-111 staff while debugging a\r\n  program, click the RATS link on the course home page.\r\nA web page will ask you to identify yourself with your Andrew user ID and the\r\n  last five digits of your CMU ID; when validated, you will be switched to\r\n  another web page that will ask you to enter the number of a phone that you\r\n  can answer and a brief description\r\n  of your programming problem.\r\nRATS will then enter you into a queue of students waiting for help.\r\n<p>\r\nA pool of CAs will serve students in this queue,in the order they submit their\r\n  problems.\r\nYou will be contacted (on your telephone) by the next free tutor (maybe one of\r\n  my CAs, maybe someone else).\r\nBoth the student and tutor will launch VNC with a special session password\r\n  generated by RATS.\r\n<p>\r\nBy using VNC and your telephone, the tutor will be able to see and manipulate\r\n  your computer screen (move the mouse, type into the editor) while talking to\r\n  you on the telephone.\r\nOf course, you can still manipulate your screen and the CA will see it too.\r\nThe interaction will simulate one in which the CA is sitting next to you:\r\n  talking to you, gathering information, and exploring potentional solutions\r\n  with you on your computer.\r\nEach of you can take control of the computer to perfom some task, with the\r\n  other able to hear and see what is happening.\r\n<p>\r\nRATS is to be used to debug programs only; it is not to be used for extended\r\n  help sessions.\r\nThere are daily opportunities to meet with staff members to discuss more\r\n  general issues.\r\nYou will be told more about RATS in class, and be required to complete a small\r\n  RATS drill by the second week of class, designed to familiarize you with\r\n  RATS.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Classroom

materials on the World Wide Web (WWW).\r\nI expect students to read the required lecture materials <b>before</b> class,\r\n  and work out solutions to the assigned problems (sometimes you can\r\n  test/verify your solutions on the computer).\r\nNote that doing the reading and working on the assigned problems <b>before</b>\r\n  class is a critical step in the learning process: students must be familiar\r\n  with the material to get the maximum benefit from the class discussions and\r\n  problem-solving sessions.\r\n<p>\r\nSolving the assigned problems is especially important, as it \"proves\" that a\r\n  student has not only read the material, but \"understood\" it is as well.\r\nHere understood means \"has used the information operationally to solve \r\n problems\".\r\nIf you have difficultly with a problem, it indicates that you should probably\r\n  review the related reading.\r\n<p>\r\nI will allow students to work together on these problems: to discuss them, to\r\n  analyze how to approach solving them, and to collaborate on their actual\r\n  solution.\r\nSuch a discussion must go beyond copying another student's answer: it involves\r\n  completely understanding the answer and the process whereby it was reached,\r\n  which includes acquiring the ability to analyze and solve similar problems.\r\nIn fact, students will be required to solve similar problems on (almost) weekly\r\n  take-home quizzes, on which no collaboration is allowed.\r\nDon't cheat yourself in this aspect of the course.\r\n<p>\r\n<!---\r\nOur TA will hold help sessions almost every evening to aid you with\r\n  understanding each reading and how to solve its problems (see the \r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/handouts/helpschedule.html\" target=\"main\">\r\n    Help Schedule</a> web page for details).\r\n--->\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr

reading(s) and amplifying on those topics that need further\r\n  discussion.\r\nCome to class with questions about any unclear parts of the reading or any\r\n  problems that you could not solve (or are unsure of your answer).\r\nClass motto:  \"Those who are ashamed of asking are ashamed of learning.\r\n  The only stupid question is the one left unasked.\"\r\n<p>\r\nI will randomly call on students to present their solutions to selected\r\n  assigned problems, and discuss them as well (please be prepared).\r\nI may also ask students to solve, either individually or in groups, other\r\n  problems relating to the material; we will then compare and discuss these\r\n  solutions.\r\nThus, I expect most \"lectures\" to be interactive, with students participating\r\n  fully.\r\n<p>\r\nI expect students to attend class daily.\r\nDuring the 30 years that I have been teaching, I have observed a strong\r\n  correlation between attending class and understanding the material (which \r\n  ultimately affects grades).\r\nHaving all the course materials on the World Wide Web (WWW) is a great\r\n  resource, but just as important is coming to class -and paying attention,\r\n  once you are there, and participating by volunteering information when you\r\n  know it and asking questions when you are confused.\r\n<p>\r\nI encourage you to participate by raising your hand; sometimes I may finish\r\n  the point I'm making before calling on you, but please keep your hand up if\r\n  you want to speak.\r\nIf you have a question about the material, it typically means that I have\r\n  explained something incorrectly, poorly, or incompletely, and that other\r\n  students have (or will soon have, maybe right after they leave the classroom)\r\n  the same question.\r\nSo, it would be best for all of us to correct the problem immediately in class\r\n  by someone bringing it to my attention.\r\nIn summary, this class runs on the Dershowitz principle:\r\n  \"Question authority; but raise your hand first\".\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr

the start of class are often very important; also,\r\n  I reserve the right to give small pop-quizzes on the readings at the start\r\n  of class. \r\nI expect students to neither carry on private conversations, nor use\r\n  their computers to answer email, surf the web, day trade stocks, or\r\n  perform any other activities unrelated to this course.\r\n<p>\r\nRinging cell phones disrupt my lectures.\r\nUnless you are responsible for someone's life, your cell phone should be\r\n  turned off.\r\nOtherwise, you should set it to operate in some silent mode (as mine will be\r\n  set); if it rings silently, please leave the class, with a minimum of\r\n  disruption to the rest of the students, to answer it.\r\nIf your cell phone rings audibly in class, you will be charged a 2 pt point\r\n  deduction the first time, and a 5 point deduction for all subsequent\r\n  infractions.\r\nFinally, if you know that you must leave early, please sit near a door,\r\n  so that you can exit quietly and without disturbing the class.\r\n<p>\r\nOverall, please strive to be a considerate class member, both to me and to\r\n  your fellow

is\r\n  getting the necessary hands-on programming experience.\r\nWhile working on these programs, you will acquire a solid and fine-tuned\r\n  understanding of the course material as well as gain important\r\n  <i>process of programming</i> skills.\r\nPrograms will typically be discussed and started in Lab on Thursdays, and be\r\n  due (submitted electronically) Wednesday evening at 11:30pm (typically\r\n  1 week after they are assigned).\r\n<p>\r\nStudents will often be required to work in groups of two on programming\r\n  assignments.\r\nSuch an approach is called\r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html\" tarket =\"_top\">\r\n  Pair Programming</a>.\r\nOn student from each pair submit all parts of the programming assignment\r\n  with both their names on it (in the code files).\r\nApart from your pair, you can get <b>general</b> help from anyone (Instructor,\r\n  TA, Lab Tutors, friends, etc.) on programs.\r\nThe best kind of help to get is oral: where you describe the problem, possibly\r\n  showing your code, and then get an oral answer that you understand and\r\n  translate into code.\r\nIn such instances, you are learning. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>You may neither copy nor transcribe (written or orally) any parts of another\r\n    student's program, nor have another student sit down and correct your\r\n    program.</b> \r\n<p>\r\nWhen you submit your programs for grading, you are expected to understand all\r\n  parts of them and have improved your <i>process of programming</i> skills\r\n  while writing and debugging them.\r\nStudents who complete their own programs in this way will be well prepared for\r\n  the In-Class Programming Exams; students who get too much help (on purpose,\r\n  or accidentally) will have a difficult time on these exams, which\r\n  can severely impact their grade.    \r\n<p>\r\nYou will submit your solutions to programming assignments through a special\r\n  web page that records the time they are submitted.\r\nYou can resbumit your programs as many times as you want.\r\nWe will grade only the final submission.\r\n<p>\r\nTo promote good time management skills, if you submit a program at least 24\r\n  hours  before it is due, you will receive 1 point of extra credit.\r\nIf you submit a program 48 hours early, you will receive 2 points.\r\nYou can gain no more than 2 points of extra credit by early submission.\r\nFor a 45 point assignment, this extra credit is equivalent to almost half a\r\n  letter grade improvement.\r\nIn general, it is a bad idea to submit programs more than 48 hours early\r\n  (typically we will return graded programs on Monday, and you should wait to\r\n  receive them and see how they are grades before submitting your new program).\r\n<p>\r\nI know from long teaching experience that students who work ahead of the\r\n  deadlines learn more, in a less stressed envrionment: students working right\r\n  up to a deadline are more concerned with getting the right answer and less\r\n  concerned with learning anything.\r\nOn the other side of this coin, I will not accept any late programs.\r\nSo, you must turn in your work on time: if you turn in a partially working\r\n  program on time, it will receive partial credit; if you do not turn in\r\n  anything on time, then I must assume you did no work on the program, and you\r\n  will receive no credit.\r\nTherefore, always turn in whatever work you have finished by the official due\r\n  time.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\"

=\"20%\"><a name=\"Policy\"><b>Policy</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThe decision as to whether a student has cheated depends on the intent of an\r\n  assignment, the ground rules specified by the instructor, and the behavior of\r\n  the student. \r\nThe following two guidelines help an instructor decide if cheating has\r\n   occurred on programming, which is the fuzziest area:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if an assignment that calls for independent\r\n         development and implementation of a program results in two or more \r\n         solutions so similar that one solution can be converted to the\r\n         other(s) by a series of simple transformations.\r\n  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if a student who completed an assignment \r\n         cannot explain both the intricacies of the solution and \r\n         the techniques used to generate that solution.\r\n</ul>\r\nIt is unreasonable to expect a complete definition of cheating that would cover\r\n  all cases, because each situation is important enough to merit careful,\r\n  individual scrutiny; however, it is helpful to have guidelines and\r\n   precedents.\r\n<p>\r\nHere are some examples that are clearly cheating and clearly not cheating.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Examples of CHEATING</b>:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Turning in someone else's work, in whole or in part, as your own (with or\r\n        without his/her knowledge), without it including a statement of\r\n        collaboration in the solution.\r\n  <li>Allowing another student to turn in your work, in whole or in part, as\r\n        his/her own, without it including a statement of collaboration in the\r\n        solution.\r\n  <li>Turning in a completely duplicated assignment.\r\n      Even if all the comments are changed, all the variables names are\r\n        changed, all the whitespace is changed, and the code appears in a\r\n        different order: it is still the same program.\r\n  <li>Several students/pairs writing one assignment and turning in multiple\r\n        copies, all represented (implicitly or explicitly) as an individual\r\n        student's/pair's work, without it including a statement of\r\n        collaboration in the solution.\r\n  <li>After receiving graded written work, returning written work, for\r\n        regrading, which has been altered.\r\n  <li>Finding a solution to the same problem on the web and submitting it\r\n        without explicit attribution in the solution.\r\n  <li>Stealing an examination or solution from the instructor.\r\n</ul>\r\nGenerally, you should NOT EXAMINE, by reading hardcopy or by copying a file,\r\n  the program of any other student (nor should you let anyone examine or make\r\n  a copy of your files).\r\nDoing so can easily lead to an intended or unintended academic violation.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you ever feel that after talking to someone about a program, which is legal,\r\n  your solution will be very similar to theirs, cite the consultation in the\r\n  header comment in your program.\r\nDoing so protects you from University disciplinary action (although the\r\n  instructor is free to grade the material as he/she sees fit).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Examples of NOT CHEATING</b>:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Turning in work done alone or with the help of the course's staff.\r\n  <li>Submitting one assignment for a group of students if group work is \r\n        explicitly permitted (or required, as in pair-programming).\r\n  <li>Getting or giving help about using the computers.\r\n  <li>Getting or giving help about solving syntax errors.\r\n  <li>High level discussions of course material to better understand them.\r\n  <li>Discussing assignments to better understand them.\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain, the key here is not studying, verbatim, someone else's code, and then\r\n  reproducing it as your own work.\r\nIt is too easy to copy such code without really understanding it.\r\nTechnically, for programming assignments, even understanding the resulting code\r\n  is not enough (if someone else wrote it): you should also play an active role\r\n  in synthesizing and debugging it.\r\nThe course is as much about skills as

available.\r\nSome use search engines to compare selected portions of submitted papers to\r\n  content on the web.\r\nIn the context of programming, they compare each student's program to those\r\n  submitted by his/her classmates (for this quarter, and any previous\r\n  quarters if the assignment has been repeated).\r\nThis software does not compare programs exactly: it ignores format changes,\r\n  variable name changes, and a variety of well-know transformations that\r\n  change the look of code but not its underlying logic.\r\n<p>\r\nMany courses in ICS use this software to spot potential cheating cases.\r\nOnce it identifies suspicious behavior, instructors carefully examine the\r\n  flagged code to make a final determination as to whether students will be\r\n  prosecuted for cheating.\r\nOften instructors can find additional evidence of cheating, once this\r\n  software points them to the simlar code.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table

occurred.\r\nIf, in the instructor's opinion it has, the instructor will apply appropriate\r\n  disciplinary policy.\r\nIn my courses, for a typical case of cheating, the student will be awarded\r\n  negative credit for the assignment (under the precept that not doing an\r\n  assignment, and receiving no points, is better than cheating on it).\r\nFor particular egregious forms of cheating (e.g., cheating on exams, stealing\r\n  another student's work so he/she cannot submit it for credit), higher\r\n  penalties can be extracted (from loss of a letter grade, through immediate\r\n  failure of the course, up through suspension or expulsion from UCI).\r\n<p>\r\nInstructors must contact the student within 15 calendar days of discovering\r\n  evidence of academic dishonesty and evaluating the relevant work.\r\nNotice of any action taken by an instructor will also be forwarded to the\r\n  Associate Undergraduate Dean of ICS, the Associate Undergraduate Dean of\r\n  the student's home school (if different), and the Office of the Dean of the\r\n  Division of Undergraduate Education.\r\nThese offices act as a repository for such information, in case the student\r\n  commits multiple infractions.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><a

Statement</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nCheating undermines the fabric of education.\r\nThe atmosphere at UCI (contrary to whatever opinions, prejudices, or\r\n  superstitions you hold) is one of fostering cooperation between faculty and\r\n  students in the pursuit of learning, knowledge, and wisdom.\r\nThis course, for example, is graded on an absolute scale, not a curve;\r\n  so, helping other students doesn't affect your grade.\r\nAnd, if a student cheats for a higher grade, other students do not receive\r\n  lower grades as a result.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough it is embarrassing to fail an assignment, getting caught cheating is\r\n  much worse.\r\nI know, though, that students rarely think about getting caught.\r\nBut think about it: I often see students break down and cry when they get\r\n  caught cheating and only then start to realize the consequences of their\r\n  actions.\r\nTheir stress level goes through the roof and it immediately affects both the\r\n  academic and social aspects of their lives.\r\nThe process is distressing for me too, although I must confess that I have been\r\n  hardened by the number of times that I have had to go through it (typically\r\n  multiple times each quarter).\r\nPursuing these cases at the University level takes a lot of my time, and\r\n  reduces the time that I can spend on more important matters relating to my\r\n  course and my students.\r\nIt is definitely a lose-lose situation.\r\n<p>\r\nThe #1 excuse that I hear for cheating is, \"I was pressed for time, so I\r\n  cheated.\"\r\nBy carefully managing your time, you can avoid this problem.\r\nIf you start working early enough, and run into problems (and you should expect\r\n  to run into problems), you will have time for the course staff to help you\r\n  learn to solve them.\r\nAlso, I understand that some students take this course only because it is a\r\n  requirement for their major, and that they have little intrinsic interest in\r\n  the subject area; this is not a valid excuse for cheating either.\r\n<p>\r\nI have seen too many instances recently where student A asks a friend, student\r\n  B, for help; specifically, A asks to see B's quiz or code (on paper or in a\r\n  computer file).\r\nOften, A copies B's code (with or without B's knowledge).\r\nI understand that B feels pressure to give A help.\r\nBut, B is doing A no favor if A's cheating is discovered; B has made a bad \r\n situation (A would receive no credit) worse (A receives negative credit and is\r\n  reported to the Dean of Student Affairs).\r\nAnd, according to UCI's rules, B can get into trouble for these actions too.\r\nI have seen friendships shattered because A copies B's code without telling B\r\n  what was done, and then both get prosecuted under UCI's rules.\r\n<p>\r\nA similar situation arises with cheating on quiz questions.\r\nI have seen too many students cheat on one question on a quiz and receive a\r\n  negative score for the whole quiz (and letter to the Dean of Student\r\n  affairs), when leaving the question blank would result in a small point\r\n  deduction and no university action.\r\n<p>\r\nIn my final statement here, I ask you to pause and reflect on the consequences\r\n  of choosing to cheat at UCI: this includes the impacts that it will have on\r\n  you, your parents, your siblings, your friends, and your fellow classmates\r\n  at UCI.\r\nCheating is invariably the wrong decision.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Policy Exceptions -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"PolicyExceptions\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\"
