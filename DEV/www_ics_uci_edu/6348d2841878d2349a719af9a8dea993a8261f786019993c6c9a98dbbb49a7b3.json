This result solves a question posed by G&uuml;nter M. Ziegler, and is\nthe first nontrivial subexponential upper bound on the long-standing\nopen question of the grid size necessary to embed arbitrary convex\npolyhedra, that is, about efficient versions of Steinitz's 1916\ntheorem. An immediate consequence of our result is that O(log n)-bit\ncoordinates suffice for a greedy routing strategy in planar 3-trees.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"http://erikdemaine.org/papers/StackedPolytopes_SODA2011/paper.pdf\">a paper by Erik D.
