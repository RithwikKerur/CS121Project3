A client is the \nsoftware that allows users to access and browse the World Wide Web.  Clients\ncan display HTML pages in their desired format.  They are refered to as \nbrowsers and respond to a user.  Servers, on the other hand, are computers \non which the Web documents reside and which runs HTTP software to permit Web \ntransactions.  Look into the various <A \nHREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Clients\">client software products</A> \nand <A \nHREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/Overview.html\">World-Wide \nWeb server software products</A> available for more information.<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a><p>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What is HTML and what is its purpose?</H2></A> HTML \nstands for <B>Hypertext Markup Language</B>.  One uses <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell\">HTML</A> to create a \nWeb page.  Web clients display HTML pages according to their coded format.  \nHTML is a protocol designed specifically for the Web:  <I>any</I> browser \ncan read and display a written document that fits its needs, for html \ncarefully defines the document for this purpose.  The reason why html can \nbe so versatile for browsers is that it expresses information in raw \nform, without consideration for formatting.  For more information on \nhtml, go to the <A HREF=\"http://fire.clarkson.edu/doc/html/htut.html\">HTML \nDocument Tutorial</A>.<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions. </it></a><p>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>I want to apply to graduate school in English \nat the University of Washington.  What are the admissions \nrequirements?</H2></A> The <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/\">\nUniversity of Washington Home Page</A> is a good place to start on \ninformation about the university.

Who \ndoes\nresearch in this field?</H2></A> A couple of professors in the \nschool of social sciences do research in \nlinguistics.  A good way to start one's search is by getting a broad \nview on who the professors in the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/personnel.html\">cognitive\nscience department</A> are.  In this search, one can also find \ndescriptions of each professor's research areas.  The two professors \nwho conduct\nresearch in linguistics are as follows:  <A \nHREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/landau/landau.html\">professor \nBarbara Landau</A>, who works with spatial knowledge and language \nlearning, and <A \nHREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/kean/kean.html\">professor \nMary Louise Kean</A>, who works with linguistic theory and \nbiological foundations of higher mental processes.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a><p>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>I've heard a Sting version of a song called \n\"Come Down in Time\" but wasn't sure who wrote it or what the lyrics are.
