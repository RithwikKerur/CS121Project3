Let the \"small\" pentagon of a \npentagon P be denoted S(P).\n\nAs someone (Peter Montgomory?) noted, some two of the five points have \nthe same parity, so one of the ten edges connecting pairs of vertices \nhas a lattice midpoint m.\n\nIf m is in S(abcde), we are done.\n\nElse, if m is on an interior diagonal of the pentagon,\nsay m = (a+c)/2, then one of the two pentagons abmde and mbcde is \nconvex, say mbcde, and S(mbcde) is a subset of S(abcde).  By induction \non number of lattice points contained in the original pentagon, S(mbcde) \ncontains a lattice point, which is also a lattice point of S(abcde).\n\nElse, suppose m is on an edge, say ab, and consider the convex pentagon \nmbcde. Now, S(mbcde) is not a subset of S(abcde), but it is a subset of \nthe union of S(abcde) and the triangle T formed by lines ac, bd, and be.  \nAs before, by induction, S(mbcde) contains a lattice point f.  If f is \nin S(abcde), we are done.  If f is not in S(abcde), it is in T, and \nafcde is a convex pentagon such that S(afcde) is a subset of S(abcde);  \nby induction a third time, S(afcde) contains a lattice point, which is \nalso a lattice point in S(abcde).\n\nQED.\n\nLook ma, no Pick's theorem or anything...\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
