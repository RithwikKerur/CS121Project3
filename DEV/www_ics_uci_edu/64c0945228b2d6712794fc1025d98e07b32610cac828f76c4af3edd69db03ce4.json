These statements therefore\nconstitute the <EM>premises</EM> for this dissertation.\nOne statement, however, is less accepted and requires\nfurther investigation: ``Explicit modeling of\nsoftware uncertainties improves human judgment and\ndecision making during software development.''\nThis statement therefore constitutes the\n<EM>hypothesis</EM> for this dissertation and will be\nfurther elaborated and validated.\n<P>\nOur initial observation is that software is extremely\ncomplex, i.e., that ``software systems are perhaps the\nmost intricate of man's handiworks''&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#BrooksAnniversary\">Bro95</A>].\nSoftware complexity is not only ubiquitous, it is also\n<EM>intrinsic</EM>:\n``The complexity of software is an essential property,\nnot an accidental one''&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#brooks87\">Bro87</A>].  ``By essential\nwe mean that we may master this complexity, but we can\nnever make it go away''&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#BoochOOAD\">Boo94</A>].\nComplexity hinders software understanding, yet understanding\nmust be afforded if development is to be successful.\n<P>\nTo manage complexity, software development concerns\nare often separated in time and space.  Thus, software\nis typically developed in distinct phases by different\nteams of developers.  Large-scale software is often\nlong-lived and delivered in multiple version, thereby\ncomprising a family of related programs&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#ParnasExtension\">Par79</A>].\n<P>\nThe product of software development is typically a\nlarge and complex collection of software elements of\ndiverse types.  Software artifact collections often\ncontain not only millions of source code lines,\nbut also versioned releases, volumes of user \nmanuals and documentation, requirements and design\nspecifications, test cases and test results, and so forth.\nMoreover, these software objects are typically\nintegrated and correlated within themselves and\nwith each other in surprisingly intricate and subtle\nways&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#SteinbergYosemite\">SZ92</A>].  This poses\nsubstantial impediments to software understanding,\nparticularly with respect to traceability,\nvisualization, and navigation issues, thereby\nleading to the following research question.\n<P>\n<B>Research Question</B>:\n<BLOCKQUOTE> Given the intricacy and complexity of software\nartifact relationships, what can be done to\nimprove traceability, visualization, and\nnavigation of large artifact collections?\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nAs a first step, it is proposed that software systems\nbe viewed as large hypertexts, since hypertext offers\na coherent and consistent metaphor for viewing both\ninter- as well as intra-artifact relationships\n(cf.&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#ZivResearchIssues\">ZO95</A>, <A HREF=\"node6.html#SteinbergYosemite\">SZ92</A>]).\nHere, it suffices to define hypertext informally\nas providing node-and-link views and navigation\nof software artifact collections.  Hypertext is\ndefined more formally and completely in\nChapter&nbsp;<A HREF=\"#background\"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"gif\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/cross_ref_motif.gif\"></A>.  We therefore contend\nthat a hypertext metaphor of software artifacts\nand relations should improve developer's ability\nto trace or track related elements in large and\ncomplex software spaces.\n<P>\nDespite the above, hypertext is no ``silver bullet''\nfor relieving software artifact complexities and\nuncertainties.  Specifically, hypertext introduces\nseveral concerns regarding its efficacy for\nsoftware engineering&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#ZivResearchIssues\">ZO95</A>].\nHere, we are particularly concerned with the\nwell-known navigation problem of user confusion\nand disorientation in large hypertext spaces as\nwell as the fact that hypertext systems generally\nare not designed with software engineering in mind.\nThis means that hypertext does not necessarily\naddress the unique needs of software developers\nand users nor does it model or make use of the\nunique characteristics of software systems.\nAdditional means should, therefore, be provided to further\nfacilitate understanding of software artifact collections.\nThe following statements concern this facilitation.\n<P>\nWe claim that software engineering is fraught\nwith uncertainties.  Software uncertainties\ncontribute significantly to the overall complexity \nand unpredictability of software development.\nLike complexity, uncertainty is inherent to the\nengineering of software systems.  This observation\nis summarized succinctly in&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#ZivMUSE\">ZRK96</A>] as the \n<EM>Maxim of Uncertainty in Software Engineering</EM>:\n<BLOCKQUOTE> <EM>\nUncertainty is inherent and inevitable in software processes\nand products.\n</EM>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nExamples of software uncertainties abound - many are provided\nin this dissertation.  Starting in Chapter Four, we focus on\nuncertainties associated with developers' confidence levels\nin software artifacts, including, among others, requirements\nspecifications, design elements, code modules, and testing\ninformation.  These confidence levels fluctuate frequently\nduring development.  Their modeling should, therefore,\ninclude a scheme for confidence revision and updating.\n<P>\nWe now arrive at the high-level statement of the hypothesis\nfor this dissertation.\n<P>\n<B>High-level Research Hypothesis</B>:\n<BLOCKQUOTE> Explicitly modeling uncertainty improves human judgment and\ndecision making during software development. \n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nThis hypothesis is too vague to be investigated and\nvalidated directly.  Instead, we require a more specific\nformulation, including a specific technique for software\nuncertainty modeling.\nTo model software uncertainties, we turn to artificial\nintelligence research in modeling and management of\nuncertainty.  We select a specific uncertainty modeling\ntechnique called Bayesian belief networks&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node6.html#Pearl88\">Pea88</A>].\nDetailed reasons for this choice are provided in Chapter Four.\n<P>\nHere, it suffices to say that Bayesian networks\noffer a clear conceptual model of causality among related\nelements and include algorithms for belief revision and\nupdating.  This leads to our specific hypothesis below.\nThe hypothesis speaks in terms of software artifacts,\nwhich include, among others, requirements elements,\ndesign nodes, code modules, and test information,\nrelationships among those artifacts, established as\npart of the development process, and confidence\nlevels, which reflect developer confidences in\ncertain qualities and properties of software artifacts.\n<P>\n<B>Specific Research Hypothesis</B>:\n<BLOCKQUOTE> Bayesian-network models of software artifact uncertainties improves\nunderstanding of associated confidence levels, compared to simply\nfollowing linked information, ultimately leading to better human\ndecision making.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nIn the long run, we believe that proper adoption and use of\nuncertainty modeling techniques will improve human judgment\nand decision making during software development.  For the\npurposes of this dissertation, we focused on the specific\nhypothesis above and took steps toward its validation,\nas follows:\n<OL><LI>\nAn existing software system was selected as case study.\nThe system of choice, called CEquencer, is currently\nunder development at Beckman Instruments in Fullerton,\nCA.  CEquencer is designed to control and communicate\nwith various hardware devices that in turn are used by \nbiologists, chemists, and other scientists to separate\nlaboratory specimens into molecular constituents in\norder to determine their DNA sequences.\nCEquencer software artifacts are described in Chapter Five.<LI>\nCEquencer requirements were investigated throughly,\nand a hypertext model as well as a Bayesian-network\nmodel of those requirements were constructed.<LI>\nA key subsystem of CEquencer, called FSM Run, was\ninvestigated thoroughly, resulting in a hypertext\nmodel of software artifacts, including all FSM Run\ncode modules as well as related requirements.<LI>\nSoftware uncertainty information was collected for FSM Run\nartifacts.  The information was elicited from Beckman\nexperts and developers and organized in a Bayesian network.<LI>\nOur main hypothesis was evaluated against FSM Run code\nmodules and related requirements, as identified in (2)\nabove.  In a questionnaire session with the Beckman team,\ndevelopers were asked to trace artifacts and associated\nconfidence levels with and without the Bayesian-network\nrepresentation of confidence values.<LI>\nResults were gathered for the case study and analyzed\nfor statistical significance.  Results of the\nquestionnaire session are summarized in Chapter Six.\n</OL><HR><A NAME=\"tex2html42\" HREF=\"node4.html\"><IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"next\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/next_motif.gif\"></A> <A NAME=\"tex2html40\" HREF=\"node1.html\"><IMG WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"up\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/up_motif.gif\"></A> <A NAME=\"tex2html34\" HREF=\"node2.html\"><IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"previous\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/previous_motif.gif\"></A>   <BR>\n<B> Next:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html43\" HREF=\"node4.html\">Dissertation Contributions</A>\n<B>Up:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html41\" HREF=\"node1.html\">Introduction</A>\n<B> Previous:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html35\" HREF=\"node2.html\">Software Uncertainty Modeling</A>\n<P><ADDRESS>\n<I>Hadar Ziv <BR>\nFri Jun 20 16:22:31 PDT 1997</I>\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
