Unfortunately, this publication can only be \nread after a  costly payment of $7.95 for 20 issues. Nevertheless, <I>The  \nWashington  Weekly </I> is available for all interested readers  through Internet on  \nGopher (dolphin.gulf.net,     port    70)   \nand   the   World-Wide   Web (http://dolphin.gulf.net/).  <A HREF= \n\"gopher://dolphin.gulf.net:3000/hh/\">The CONTENTS</A> of the publication are available for public use at no cost. \nBesides this source of political information from the conservatives of \nthis country, one can also find a more factual account of White House \nongoings through <A HREF= \n\"http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/WhiteHouse.html\"> White House Watch.</A>\n    \n\n <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B> What are the names of all the UCI faculty \nwithin the political science department, and how can I contact them on \ne-mail?</B></A><br>\nThe names of all the UCI political science faculty members are always available in the \nUCI catalogs in hard copy.

Some of the more\nwell-known \nfaculty members include Professor James Danziger, former Chair of the Department of \nPolitical Science and current Chair of the Academic Senate; Professor David Easton\nwho is credited for developing the basic jargon associated with the study of poltical\nscience; and Professor Mark Petracca who has always remained in the public eye with\ncountless columns in newspapers as well as television appearances.

To become more \nfamiliar with political literature on the current debates ensuing in\nRussia, one can scan the contents of <A HREF=\"http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/slavrev/fall94/toc.web\">\n<I><B>Slavic Review</B></I></A>. Some articles discuss topics such as national identity in\nRussia, parliamentary elections, and book reviews. Beyond current social and\npolitical issues within the country, one can become familiar with the culture by\nscanning the Internet Art Galleries which include an <A \nHREF=\"http://www.kiae.su/www/wtr/hotpictures/gallery.html\"><B>Electronic PhotoGallery</B></A>\nfeaturing the work of Russsian artists such as Alexander Kholopov and Boris Mikhailov.\nLastly, to genuinely familiarize oneself to the country, some working knowledge\nof <A HREF= \" gopher://infomeister.osc.edu:74/11/russian/obscenities\"><B> Russian obscenties\n</B></A> is almost a \nmust! <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B> I wish I had actually read Vannevar Bush so \nthat I would have done a bit better on Quiz #1.
