Here is the unsolved problem:  Given a subset S of the plane, a\nbeam detector for S is a curve or union of curves D such that every straight\nline which intersects S also intersects D. \n\nClaim:  If S is a convex closed curve in the plane, then the\nminimum length for a beam detector for S is at least half the length of S.  \n\nProof:  there is a canonical measure on the set of lines in the plane: in\nlocal coordinates given by (t, theta) where t is the intersection with a\nline L, and (0 &lt; theta &lt; pi) is the angle, the measure is   d t  d theta.\nThis measure does not depend on L.  The total measure of lines intersecting\na curve D is at most pi(length D).  The total measure of lines\nintersecting S is pi/2 length(S), since a.e. line which hits S hits twice.\n\nQUESTION:  Is there a lower bound strictly greater than pi\nfor the length of a beam detector for the unit circle?\n\n(There are examples of beam detectors for the unit circle which have length\nless than 2 pi.  For instance, there is a ``bow-and-arrow'' configuration\ninscribing the circle in a square: use a quarter of the circle, extended\nby two half-sides of the square, together with half of a main diagonal of\nthe square.)\n\nAny beam detector D for the circle\nwith length near pi would have to be mainly inside the\nsquare, and it would have to have the property that most lines which\nintersect D intersect it just once.  Could D consist of a lot of tiny\nshort arcs, so that when you stand on any of the arcs and look at\nall the others, they all tend to line up as in an orchard, but when\nyou view D from outside the circle, you only see trees?\n\nBill Thurston    princeton!wpt\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@garfield.columbia.edu\">eppstein@garfield.columbia.edu</A>\n<B>To:</B>             princeton!wpt\n<B>Subject:</B>        Beam detectors etc\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nI haven't solved your problem, which was to find a better lower bound\nthan pi for a beam detector for the unit circle.  However I have found\na better detector than the one you gave (square bow and arrow, total\nlength pi/2 + 2 + sqrt(2) = ~4.985).  It looks a lot like the bow and\narrow, but it's based on a hexagon.  It can be found by extending the\nends of a semicircle to the vertices of a circumscribing hexagon, and\nadding a line segment from the remaining vertex halfway to the center.\nI guess that's not a very clear description, but anyway it's a beam\ndetector and its length is pi + sqrt(3) = ~4.874.  So is this new or\ninteresting?\n\nAlso this led me to a couple of conjectures, which I wonder if you\ncould comment on.  First, is the best detector for a triangle known to\nbe a Steiner tree on its vertices?  Second, is it known that a minimum\ndetector for any set consists of only straight line segments except\npossibly for parts of the set's convex hull?  I don't have any idea\nhow to prove either of these but they seem reasonable...\n\n...\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Sunday, 16 November 1986  15:38-EST\n<B>From:</B>           seismo!princeton!wpt at columbia.edu\n<B>To:</B>             eppstein at garfield.columbia.edu\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nI don't know what the best currently known beam detector for the circle\nis; someone at Bell Labs must know, I'll inquire.

It appears that the best beam\ndetector that's known is due to E. Makai. He published in 1980\nan abstract, of which we have a copy, and which is reviewed in \nZentralblatt 459/52005.  In it he says that a bow-and-arrow\nconstruction (section of the boundary of a  circle, segments of the tangents\nto the circle at the endpoints, and a segment perpendicular to\nthe line connecting the ends of the circle segments) gives a\nset of length 4.8189....  In a recent letter to Larry Shepp,\nhe pointed out that this construction can be improved by about \n1/10000.  If the endpoints of the circle segments are R and S,\nand the two tangent line segments are RQ and PS, then one can replace\nRQ by the altitude from Q of the triangle PQR.  A few further\nmodifications of this kind ought to give slight further improvements,\naccoring to Makai.\n\nAndrew Odlyzko\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
