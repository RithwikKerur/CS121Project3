We\nwill announce meetings, schedule changes, new policies, and so on;\nyour students will suffer if you don't have the up-do-date\ninformation. Get into this habit now, and keep it throughout the\nquarter.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Mark your calendar</b> for the afternoons and\nevenings following the midterm(s) and final exam. We will <b>get\ntogether and do all the grading</b> of all the exams and recording the\nscores at that single time; things go fastest and most smoothly that\nway. Bring a laptop; we'll grade using Gradescope (on scanned exams).\nTAs and the instructor will meet again the day after the final\nexam to set the final grades. Every TA must do his or her part for\nthis process to run smoothly. In particular, this means that all of\nyour labs must be graded and recorded in the EEE GradeBook the day\nbefore the final exam. Since you know this now, please arrange your\nown exam studying and travel schedule to accommodate these\nconstraints.</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">TAs can get a roster of enrolled students via EEE.\nIf students add the course late, keep a record of\nwhen they added (so you don't penalize them for making up the\nlab assignments after the deadline).</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b></b>Your students need to create accounts to\nget access to the ICS lab machines, but they don't have to do it\nimmediately. For a week or two, they can log in as ics-temp with the\npassword Anteat3r . On their own time, they should go to the\nthird-floor lab and sign up for an ICS account.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Consider setting office hours.</b> With\nscheduled lab hours three days a week, students can see you regularly. But\nsometimes students can use five or ten minutes of one-on-one\nexplanation. The conventional way to provide this is by scheduling\nsome office hours; a difficulty with that approach is that sometimes\nnobody will show up to a scheduled hour and some students will have\nconflicts with whatever hours you schedule. It's fine to make the\ngesture by scheduling an hour or two, but these days it's equally fine\nnot to schedule hours in advance and instead to make it clear\nrepeatedly to the class that you will be glad to consult with them\none-on-one; they just need to ask you and you'll work out a mutually\nagreeable time. Experience shows that the latter approach consumes\nless of your time in total. You can devote some of the time you save\nto answering questions on Piazza.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Look at the photo roster</b> of your students\n(under WebRosters on EEE) so you can learn their names. You should\nlearn names not only because students will learn better if they know\nyou know them by name, but also because you'll be able to identify any\nnon-students who try to come and take an exam in a real student's\nplace. </li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Check that they've completed the demographic\nquestionnaire</b> at EEE and nag them until they comply. (We have yet\nto work out a mechanism for separating your sections' students from\nthe group.)</li>\n   <ul class=\"ul2\">\n     <li class=\"li4\">Students must choose a different partner for\neach lab assignment; they may not repeat partners during the\n     quarter.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The ICS\n     PartnerApp should enforce these rules, but you still need to\n     know what the rules are.l<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\n</span></li>\n     <li class=\"li4\">Most students should pick their partners for the\nnext week's lab at the end of Friday's lab.<span\nclass=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Any stragglers can partner up\non Monday.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>If there's one\nodd student, that student can join an existing pair (but only once\nduring the quarter) or can work alone (also only once).<span\nclass=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>But if another odd student\nshows up, the third person or solo worker should join the latecomer to\nform a pair. The ICS Partner App allows a TA (not a student) to\nregister permission for solos or trios; make sure you do that\nso the student isn't penalized for doing it without authorization.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\">It's generally best for students of similar\nexperience and ability to be partners; that makes the give and take\nmore even.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>However, it's\nhard to measure ability and experience levels and the pairings will\nnever be perfect.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Here's a\ntechnique to try early in the quarter:<span\nclass=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Have all the students stand up\nand form a rough line, with more experienced students on one end of\nthe room and less experienced students on the other.<span\nclass=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>The ordering doesn't have to be\nperfect, but you can suggest that they choose a partner from the\npeople who are nearby.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\">Students will complete partner evaluations at\nthe end of each lab, using the ICS Partner App.<span\nclass=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span></li>\n   </ul>\n </ul>\n <li class=\"li3\"><b>At every lab session</b></li>\n <ul class=\"ul1\">\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Be on time.</b> Students depend on having you\nthere at the scheduled time. And don't cut out early.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Be prepared</b> to answer students' questions.\nPresumably you already know the subject matter, but you must also\n<b>know the assignments.</b> The only way to do that effectively is to\nread them carefully in advance and, where possible, try to work them\nout. If a student asks whether something is important or required, you\nwant to be certain that you're giving the right answer (and check with\nthe instructor if there's a question that the assignment writeup\ndoesn't answer clearly): If you give a wrong answer on something like\nthis, the student may be graded down, and that's not a happy\nsituation. <b>Don't guess about assignment requirements;</b> if you're\nnot sure, check with the instructor (or post on Piazza) before giving\nthe student a definitive answer.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Make yourself available</b> to the students:\nEven if the students all seem busy, don't read your own e-mail, don't\nIM your friends, don't make cellphone calls, don't do your own\nclasswork, because students will hesitate to interrupt you. When\nyou're in the lab, you should circulate around and help students, not\nsimply wait for them to call on you. Don't get so deeply involved in\nconversations that you don't notice when students need help; you\nshould cruise around the room at least once every five minutes.\nWhenever you're in the instructional lab, you should be prepared to\nanswer students' questions courteously, even if you aren't officially\non duty at that time. It's unfriendly to tell a student, \"I'm not even\nsupposed to be here now,\" even if it's technically true. If you need\nto do your own work on lab machines, you may be able to work with\nfewer interruptions in the Open Lab (ICS 364).</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Spread yourself around</b> to everyone rather\nthan concentrating on just a few. If many people want you at once,\nleave the current person with a task to do independently while you\nmake the rounds. Make sure <b>each student gets at least \"first\naid\"</b> help so they can get back to work; after that, feel free to\nspend more in-depth time with students who need it. We don't want\nstudents to be able to say, \"We couldn't get anything done in lab\nbecause we had to wait an hour to talk to the TA.\" (Avoid even joking\nabout things like only paying attention to the cutest students; some\npeople won't take it as a joke.)</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Give students help, not answers.</b> It's fine\nto tell people how to solve system-related problems, or how language\nfeatures work, but you should <b>lead them to their own solutions</b>\nof programming and CS problems. They shouldn't become dependent on\nyou; <b>they should learn for themselves how to use the web\nsafely for reference, how to insert extra debugging\nprint statements, how to do execution traces.</b> Be pleasant\nbut ruthless about this. Students will beg you for a quick-fix answer,\nand it's easier for you just to give it than to point them towards\nfinding the solution themselves.  [This applies to programming\nproblems; early in the quarter you can answer direct questions\nabout how to use IDLE and what the syntax of a Python feature is.]\nNonetheless, resist the temptation,\nbecause students will come to expect you to fix their problems for\nthem. In the long run, that hurts both them and you. Your class may\nexpect students to use a \"design recipe,\" writing out a function\nsignature (input types and return type), purpose statement (docstring\ncomment), and examples (in the executable form of assert statements)\n<i>before</i> they write any code; if so, insist on seeing these\nsteps.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Encourage students to follow pair\nprogramming</b> for assignments that require it: two people, one\ncomputer, one driver, one navigator, switch roles regularly. Make sure\nthe partners are talking and changing roles, and that the less\nexperienced students don't just sit quietly and watch. If they don't\nget into this pattern right at the start, it will be much harder to\nget them to do it later. If you see a pair member who seems\ndisengaged, that's a cue that you can intervene to provide some\nhelp.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><strong>Keep an eye out for academic\ndishonesty.</strong> Pair programming does not mean that it's okay to\nget answers from anyone or anywhere. Students may freely communicate\nwith their partner, with the lab tutors, with their TA, and with the\ninstructor. Students may also post questions on Piazza.com, though\ntheir posting should not include significant portions of lab\nassignment solution code. Communication with others (non-partner\nclassmates and outsiders) is limited to questions about language\nfeatures and system setup. This quarter, we'll be a little more\nrelaxed about cross-communication in the first three weeks (for the\nfirst three lab assignments); we won't worry much about students\ngetting help from each other as they get up to speed. But starting\nwith week 4, the official guidelines are in effect.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Help students solve problems using what they\nalready know.</b> Especially in Python, there may be some advanced\nlanguage feature or library function that solves the problem in a\nsnap. But the goal is to promote their abilities with the basic\nfeatures covered in class and the textbook. Covering advanced features\ntoo soon places too great a cognitive burden on the students.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><strong>Find out what the students are supposed to\nknow.</strong> To help students use what they already know (or are\nsupposed to have learned), you have to know what that is. Most\ninstructors have published course notes or a schedule keyed to a\ntextbook; it's part of your job to keep up with these so you don't\ninadvertently tell the students something they're not ready for. A key\nprinciple of teaching introductory programming is that you can't teach\neverything all at once\u2014you have to leave some things out or cover them\nlater. It's the instructor who gets to decide what the schedule is,\nand the TAs and tutors need to be aware of those decisions and support\nthem.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Don't feel guilty</b> if you can't immediately\nidentify the student's problem or bug. While most of us <i>can</i> see\nbugs quickly for the early, trivial assignments, that may lead\nstudents to expect (unrealistically) that we'll <i>always</i> be able\nto find and fix their problems at a glance. Of course nobody can do\nthat for significant programs, and TAs need to make this clear to\nstudents, by explaining it and by encouraging them to find their own\nbugs by adding unit tests, test cases, extra print statements, and\ntracing their code\u2014whichever methods your instructor has taught them.\n(You may have to show some students how to do this step by step the\nfirst time; not everybody knows how to debug instinctively.) If a\nstudent objects to the painstaking work involved in such tracing,\nremind them that they can minimize the need for it by spending more\ntime in the design phase.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\n</span>Some novice students program \"expressionistically,\" just\nputting down code that \"feels right\"; they need to learn more\nsystematic design.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Remind students to prepare</b> for lab by\nreading and thinking about the assignment beforehand; they should be\nready to work when they sit down with their partner.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Encourage students to post course-related\nquestions on Piazza</b> if you can't answer the question in person.\nWith luck, they might get an answer before the lab session is\nover.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Maintain decorum</b> in the lab: Don't shout\nacross the room to someone (or let students do so); gently calm down\nstudents who get too rowdy or frustrated. Have students using\nsound-producing software keep the volume low or off.</li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><b>Ask students to take their food and drink\nout into the hall.</b> The carpets are new; they won't be replaced\nfor another ten years.  Students say they'll be careful, but\nthey can't guarantee that their drink won't get knocked over\nby the student in the next row trying to squeeze by.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><strong>Last one out, lock the door.</strong> If\nyour lab section is the last one in the evening, be sure to pull the\ndoor closed after the last student has left. This activates the\nalarm.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\">This hasn't happened for years, but <b>if problems\narise with a student, </b>try to deal with it calmly yourself, and if\nthat doesn't work, contact the lab manager or the instructor. In\nextreme cases, call the campus police (this has never been necessary\nin the past, though). If you suspect <b>cheating</b> or other major\ninfractions of University rules, contact the instructor directly with\nas much hard evidence as you can; you should not attempt to handle\nacademic dishonesty issues yourself.</li>\n </ul>\n <li class=\"li3\"><b>Periodically during the quarter</b></li>\n <ul class=\"ul1\">\n   <li class=\"li4\">TAs will attend <b>weekly meetings</b> where we\ncan compare notes on how things are going.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Check your electronic mail at least once\ndaily.</b> Good communication is essential, with the instructor and\nwith your students. <strong>Respond to every message in a timely\nway,</strong> within a day under normal circumstances. The response\nmight be, &quot;I'll send you a full answer later,&quot; or it might\nbe, &quot;This would be better to discuss in person than over\ne-mail.&quot; But at least send some response promptly. Official\ncourse announcements come by Email, too; they are archived at\nEEE.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Check Piazza.com periodically.</b> Feel free to\nanswer questions on Piazza.com as an instructor. But keep these points\nin mind:\n     <ul>\n       <li>The whole class will read your response, including\nstudents in other TAs' sections. Other TAs may have slightly different\ngrading criteria than you do, or may have resolved certain minor\nrequirements differently than you did. So if you suspect there may be\nvariation, say in your posting &quot;This is for students in my\nsections; check with your own TA for your section's\nrequirements.&quot; Piazza makes it easy for other TAs to add to your\nresponse and say &quot;This applies to my section, too&quot; or\n&quot;I want students in my section to do it this way.&quot; [Remember\nthat the class is graded separately by TA, so your students aren't\ncompared directly with other TAs' students.]</li>\n       <li>Your response will be read by students who are less far\nalong than the questioner (and those who are farther along).  Be\ncareful that your specific answer doesn't create more confusion among\nother students; qualify your answer so that it applies to the specific\nquestion.</li>\n       <li>Stop short of posting actual solution code on Piazza. It's\nokay to correct a single line or two and it's okay to give examples of\nhelpful techniques (in a context that's related to but not the same as\nthe assignment). But students shouldn't be able to copy and paste\nwhole solutions to problems out of Piazza.</li>\n       <li>Unless you're pointing to something that already exists in\nwriting (on the syllabus, in Email to the class, on assignment pages),\nnever make any comments about the likely contents of an exam or about\nhow scores or grades will be assigned. For the lab assignments, each\nTA has some leeway on grading decisions, but for exams and the course\nas a whole, leave those questions to the instructor; it's important\nthat the instructional staff speak with a single voice on these\nissues. Don't assume that everything will be the same this quarter as\nit was when you TA'd this class before.</li>\n   </ul>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Keep in touch</b> with the instructor in person\nor electronically. Let us know how things are going, and especially if\nanything's going wrong. It's much easier (and more effective) to\ncorrect problems early, before they get out of hand. TAs especially\nare on the \"front lines\" dealing with students' difficulties; we need\nto know what those difficulties are.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Keep track of your students,</b> watching for\nthose who aren't coming to section, who wait too long to start on\ntheir assignments, who aren't active partners in the lab, or who\notherwise aren't doing well; if you encourage them into good work and\nstudy habits early, you may save them from a sorry fate later on. With\nsections as large as ours are, there are limits on how much of this\nyou can do, but try to keep an eye out for students having\ntrouble.</li>\n   <ul class=\"ul2\">\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>Students with no previous experience</b>\noften feel intimidated by the more experienced students, especially in\nthe early weeks when they still need to learn the system and they see\nthe experienced students furiously typing away. Be sure to encourage\nthe novices to start early and ask questions of their partner;\nreassure them that their difficulties are normal and help foster their\nfeeling that they can complete the work and do well.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>Very experienced students</b> have other\nproblems: Often they think they can wait until the last minute to\ncomplete assignments; this may be true for the first few assignments,\nbut significant programs take substantial time, even for people who\nunderstand the concepts. Experienced students also may not be used to\nfollowing rigid specs imposed by someone else. Recreational\nprogrammers can just change the requirements, but our students have to\nsolve the hard problems rather than working around them.</li>\n   </ul>\n   <li class=\"li4\">Handle various <b>administrative and pedagogical\ntasks</b> as they're assigned, usually during weekly staff meetings.\nThese may include preparing test data, examples, or review\nquestions.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\">For <b>more information</b> on being a TA, talk to\nDavid Kay or the Center for Engaged Instruction office on\ncampus (cei.uci.edu, phone extension 46188).<span\nclass=\"Apple-tab-span\"> </span></li>\n </ul>\n\n <li class=\"li3\"><b>Grading lab assignments</b></li>\n <ul class=\"ul1\">\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>TAs are responsible for grading lab\nassignments.</b> There's an assignment due every Friday; under normal\ncircumstances you should grade it over the weekend and <strong>have\nthe scores and comments recorded by Monday's lab</strong>. The\nfeedback students receive from you is essential to their learning; if\nthey're most of the way through the next lab before they see how they\ndid on the previous lab, they've lost much of the benefit of the\nassignment. Conscientious new TAs and graders often want to give\nstudents lengthy, detailed comments. That's good, but you have to\nbalance that with your other obligations and the need for rapid\nfeedback. This does mean that you may not be able to give as detailed\nfeedback as you'd like. It is far better to give less feedback sooner\nthan to give more feedback later. If you'd like advice on how to give\nfeedback effectively in the available time, talk with the instructor\nand with experienced TAs.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\">Students will submit their work electronically\nusing Checkmate; you can <strong>download students'\nsubmissions</strong> from Checkmate after the due date. Just one\npartner from each team submits the work; they're supposed to but both\npartners' names in the submission itself (but the ICS Partner Appp\nis also a check on this).<span\nclass=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Score them on the holistic,\n\"coarse-grained\" check-plus/check/check-minus scale described below;\nthis should save you time and encourage students to focus on mastering\nconcepts rather than earning points.<span\nclass=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li>\n   <ul class=\"ul2\">\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>plus</b>: This is for the rare assignment\nthat is better than perfect, that does more than what was required. To\nget this score students must do something extra, beyond just\nsubmitting a perfect solution. It's best not even to mention the\n&quot;plus&quot; and the &quot;minus&quot; score when you're\ndescribing the grading to the students; just stick with\ncheck-plus/check/check-minus.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>check-plus</b>: This assignment is complete\nand correct, perhaps not perfect but with only very minor flaws.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>check</b>: This assignment was mostly\ncomplete and mostly correct; a few parts were missing or wrong, but\nmainly it was okay. Code that doesn't compile doesn't count towards a\ncheck; if none of their code compiles, check-minus is the highest\npossible score. The assignment guidelines tell them to run their code\nbefore submitting.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>check-minus</b>: This assignment was missing\nsignificant parts or had significant mistakes.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>minus</b>: This is for the rare assignment\nthat is a mere sketchy attempt; few problems are done or correct.</li>\n   </ul>\n   <li class=\"li4\">[Subject to change, Fall 2016] <b>Record the scores for your section(s) in the\nEEE gradebook.</b> Each graded item has a place for a score (which\nmust be a number) and for comments.

If you let grading pile up, you will be miserable\n(and a much less effective grader) and your students will also be\nmiserable (and will learn much less because of the delayed\nfeedback).</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\">The assignment pages should be explicit about\nwhat's required, but if you make <b>requirements, clarifications, or\ngrading criteria specific to your sections,</b> in addition to\nannouncing them frequently in section you should send them to your\nsections' mailing list<b>.</b> Students are most frustrated when they\ndon't know how they'll be graded, or when they think they were graded\non criteria they didn't know about. Giving specific written criteria\nis the best approach. We will be happy to provide further guidance on\nthis.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Maintain high standards;</b> don't give\neverybody check-pluses. If most everyone gets the highest score,\nthey'll all think they're getting As in the course and there will be a\nlot of disappointment. If the assignment is explicit about what's\nrequired, it's okay to reduce scores for students who don't do those\nthings. If a given issue wasn't covered explicitly one week, it's okay\nto tell the class that<i> next time</i> you'll deduct points for it.\n(An exception to this may be the first assignment or two, which are\ntypically simple and straightforward enough that most people do\ncomplete them perfectly.)<span class=\"Apple-tab-span\"> </span></li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s4\"></span>If there were any\nparticularly good or particularly bad assignments, or anything else\nunusual that you think the instructor should see and consider, don't\nhesitate to point them out.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Keep good (backed-up) records.</b> One reason\nfor using EEE is that it's maintained and backed up professionally.\nDon't let scores sit around on your machine; upload them to EEE right\naway.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\">If a student has a <b>question or complaint</b>\nabout a score, don't treat it as an adversary situation:</li>\n   <ul class=\"ul2\">\n     <li class=\"li4\">Don't be forced into making a snap decision on\nthe spot. If you can't tell immediately that you made a mistake, ask\nto take the paper back and review it, when nobody's breathing down\nyour neck.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\">Don't get into protracted arguments. Once you've\ngiven your reasons, if the student keeps arguing with you, say calmly\nbut clearly something like, \"I'm sorry, but that's how I graded\neveryone's paper. You know how to answer this kind of question in the\nfuture,\" and then turn to someone else.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\">If you find you made a mistake or overlooked\nsomething, change the score swiftly and gracefully. There's no shame\nin making the mistake, only in refusing to correct it.<br>\n     </li>\n   </ul>\n </ul>\n <li class=\"li3\"><b>Exam and general grading guidelines</b></li>\n <ul class=\"ul1\">\n   <li class=\"li4\">Even if you have an answer key, <b>work through\nall the problems yourself</b> before starting to grade. This is not\nmuch fun, but it's the only way you can get a feel for all the points\nbeing tested and the difficulties involved in doing the problem.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Don't be rigid</b> when grading\u2014it's often\npossible to have a solution that's correct (or nearly correct) even if\nit looks crazy at first glance. Try to figure out what the student\nmeant, and where he or she went wrong; don't just mark something wrong\nbecause it doesn't match the answer key precisely. But don't supply\nanswers that aren't there\u2014the student must communicate to you; you\ncan't be clairvoyant.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Grade consistently</b>\u2014People who show the same\nlevel of mastery should receive the same number of points. Students\nalways compare their graded papers with their classmates', and nothing\nmakes them legitimately unhappier than losing three points when\nsomeone else lost two for the same thing. Take special pains to grade\nconsistently, including the following:</li>\n   <ul class=\"ul2\">\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>Grade vertically:</b> A single person must\ngrade every student's work on a particular question or assignment.\n(This becomes an issue on exams more than lab assignments, where\nthere's nobody but you to grade your section's work.) Except for\nmultiple choice questions there's no way to keep grades consistent by\n     splitting the same work (e.g., when one person grades work from\n     students with names in A-M and the other\ndoes N-Z). Grading vertically also means it's best for a single grader\nto grade everyone's Problem One, then everyone's Problem Two, and so\non; it's easier to remember your criteria that way.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>Keep notes</b> of the partial-credit criteria\nyou use. This helps not only during the grading, but later on when\nstudents come back with questions. It's especially important for later\nprojects and the final exam, when it's not you but the instructor who\nwill have to field the students' grading questions.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>Recheck the papers you graded first,</b>\nbecause your criteria probably will shift during the course of the\ngrading.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>Shuffle the stack</b> after each pass, so you\ndon't grade the same student first (or last) on every question.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\"><b>Once some papers are graded, recheck the\ncriteria</b> by showing some of the graded work to the instructor or\nanother TA; this is another way to avoid discrepancies between the\nrequirements and the grading.</li>\n     <li class=\"li4\">Gradescope helps automate some of the above.</li>\n   </ul>\n   <li class=\"li4\">Remember that there are people behind the papers\nyou're grading. Make all your <b>comments helpful and\nconstructive.</b> Explain where the student did well, or went wrong.\n(You may want to make a list of generally applicable comments for\ndistribution to the class rather than laboriously copying the same\ncomment into many individual EEE gradebook entries.) It's best not to\ngrade in red pen; a paper bathed in red is pretty jarring. Try to\navoid giving zero points, except for a completely blank answer (or a\nproblem worth just a small number of points). One point out of ten,\neven for a completely wrong answer, isn't as discouraging as a zero\n(and having 10% instead of 0% won't significantly affect a final\ngrade). You can't be so generous with problems that have fewer than\nten points, of course.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\">Having <b>assignments and exams returned\npromptly</b> is absolutely imperative\u2014people can't study for a test\nwithout their homeworks, and they can't do projects without seeing\ntheir previous mistakes corrected. Education experts say that the\nvalue of feedback diminishes greatly with time. Your goal should be to\n<b>grade, record, and return every item before the next section\nmeeting</b> after it was due. Recording exam scores promptly is\nessential because we can't compute classwide statistics until all the\nscores are recorded. All the due dates are on the course outline, so\nyou can plan your schedule accordingly.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Be professional.</b> Nobody on the\ninstructional staff should second-guess or criticize other staff\nmembers to the students. Students' confidence in the course and the\ngrading process breaks down when they see that the instructional staff\ncan't agree among themselves. If a student expresses to you a problem\nor concern with the course or anyone involved with it, you should pass\nthat concern along to the instructor, keeping the student's name to\nyourself if you think that's necessary or appropriate.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Be conscious of security </b>while grading\nexams. Circle answers, or make lines through blank spaces, so nobody\nwill be tempted to add correct answers after the things are passed\nback. (Do this as an automatic, unfailing habit.) Also, don't leave\nanswer keys or assignments lying around unattended\u2014this especially\nmeans you must stand by the printer as they come out, so nobody picks\nit up by mistake.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Be conscious of privacy.</b> Do not let\nstudents see their classmates' scores, Email addresses, or student ID\nnumbers, all of which are private information. If you post or\ndistribute a list of grades outside of EEE, use the last four digits\nof the students' IDs, sorted numerically; that's random.<span\nclass=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Don't keep students' scores on\na computer that someone else has access to unless you have password\nprotection.</li>\n </ul>\n <li class=\"li3\"><b>At the end of the quarter</b></li>\n <ul class=\"ul1\">\n   <li class=\"li4\">Return your checked-out <b>textbooks</b>.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\">We'd appreciate it if you'd send us a <b>written\ncommentary</b> about your experiences as a TA, with suggestions for\nimproving any aspect of the course. We do change the course based on\nthese comments.</li>\n </ul>\n <li class=\"li3\"><b>Electronic Resources</b></li>\n <ul class=\"ul1\">\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>Encourage your students to post course-related\nquestions on Piazza.com. </b>They will also have your Email addresses\nand the instructor's, which they can use for personal issues like\nhaving to miss class. But if they send general questions directly to\nyou, gently encourage them to use Piazza instead, so everyone can\nbenefit from seeing the question and answer.<b> </b>As you\n<i>answer</i> questions on Piazza, stay attuned to the possibility\nthat other TAs may have given slightly different clarifications or\ninterpretations of a problem; it's best to qualify your responses\n(e.g., \"in my section ...\") in such a case. On the other hand, for\nsome assignments we may designate a specific person to handle all\nquestions about the specs; this will promote consistency across\nsections.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>To send messages to your students,</b> use the\nmailing list(s) for your lab section(s) maintained by EEE. Use this\nlist rather than one you build yourself; the registrar automatically\nupdates it as students add and drop your section, and EEE maintains a\nweb-based archive of all the messages.</li>\n   <li class=\"li4\"><b>To get a current roster for your\nsection(s),</b> including the option of a photo roster, use the roster\ntool on EEE.</li>\n </ul>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"p5\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We would be pleased to hear about other information you\nthink would be helpful to include here.</p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><br></p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/\"><i>David G.\nKay</i></a><span class=\"s5\"><i>, </i><a\nhref=\"mailto:kay@uci.edu\"><i>kay@uci.edu</i></a></span></p>\n</body>\n</html>", "encoding": "utf-8"}
