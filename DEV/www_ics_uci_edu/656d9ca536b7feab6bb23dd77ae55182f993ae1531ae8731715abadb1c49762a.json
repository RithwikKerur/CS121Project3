Use\nthe div/mod algorithm introduced in lecture for performing the operations.\n\nUnlike your previous project, your architecture should be structural\nin nature. In other words, you should first create a number of entities\nas building blocks. Then, you should instantiate these in your div/mode\narchitecture and connect them using signals.\n\nSo, your div/mod architecture should not have any process inside of it!\n\n\nImplement a partial testbench for your div/mod combinational entity in\nVHDL. The partial testbench should make use of a 8-bit and a 17-bit div/mod\nentity. For each of these, test a few cases to ensure correctness.\n\nSimulate your testbench and div/mod entity and show the wave-forms of input\nand output signals to your TA. Make sure your TA checks out your demo. This\nwill be worth 70% the points for this project.\n\nComplete a report and attach to it all source VHDL files. Your report should\ninclude your name, a description of the VHDL files attached, any special\nnotes or comments, and a description of how you tested your design.\n\nYour TA will provide you with information on tools, lab setup, and other things\nrelated to this project. Make sure you seek help to get you started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
