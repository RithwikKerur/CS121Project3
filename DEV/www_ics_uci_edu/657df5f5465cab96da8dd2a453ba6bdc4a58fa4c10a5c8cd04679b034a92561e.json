You must partition the \nvertices of the graph into two subsets, so that each subset is connected \nand contains no cycle.</p>\n\n<p>For planar graphs, this is equivalent to finding a Hamiltonian cycle in \nthe dual graph, so it is NP-complete.  But for nonplanar graphs, it might \nhave different time bounds than the Hamiltonian cycle problem.</p>\n\n<ol type=a>\n<li>Outline a generate-and-test algorithm for this problem.\nI.e., describe a class of potential solutions, such that\na partition into two trees (if it exists) can be found in polynomial time\nfrom one of the potential solutions.  Try to make the size of the set of \npotential solutions as small as possible.</li>\n\n<br>&nbsp;\n\n<li>How many potential solutions are there in your answer to part (a)?\nGive your answer as a formula involving n and/or m, the numbers of vertices \nand edges respectively in the input graph.</li>\n\n<br>&nbsp;\n\n<li>Describe a recursive backtracking search for a solution,\nusing the same space of partial solutions. What opportunities are there to\ndiscover that a potential solution will not work and return early from a \nrecursive call?</li>\n\n<br>&nbsp;\n\n<li>Does your backtracking solution have better worst-case complexity than \nthe generate-and-test solution?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Due <a href=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">by email</a>\nMonday, Oct. 23, 11:59PM.</h3>\n\nPlease <b>do not send MS Word</b> or other proprietary formats.\nPlain text, TeX, HTML, or PDF are all acceptable.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
