But programming languages are simple and unambiguous, and computer\nprocessors interpret them more reliably than human beings interpret natural\nlanguage instructions.  Writing instructions for human execution, then,\nrequires skills that programmers may not automatically possess.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>This assignment:</B>  Build some object\nusing Tinkertoys, Lego, or some other system with more than one type of\ncomponent that can be combined in more than one way.  (Note that some small\nLego kits do have just one &quot;correct&quot; assembly; such kits would\nnot be suitable for this assignment.)  You must be able to bring to class\nall the pieces necessary for assembling your object.  Your object should\nconsist of 20-30 pieces.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Then, write a manual that explains how to\nbuild your object.  On Wednesday, April 10, you will bring the individual\ncomponents of your object and three copies of your manual to section; then\nsome of your classmates will try to follow your manual to build your object.\n At the same time, you will be following someone else&#39;s manual, so you\nwill not be available to answer oral questions about your manual or your\nobject&mdash;your classmates&#39; success will depend entirely on your writing.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>There is no required length for this manual;\ntake as much space as you need to get the job done, and no more.  Similar\nassignments in the past have typically been four to five pages long.  The\nfocus of this assignment is prose, not pictures.  You must do your job without\nany illustrations.  This also means that when you bring your components\nto class, you must be sure not to bring them in a package that shows the\nfinal product. </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Due dates:</B>  \n<BR>\n&bull; Wednesday, April 10&mdash;Bring to class the disassembled components of your object and\n<I>three copies</I> of a good draft of your manual.  As noted above, you\nwill build each other&#39;s objects in class, which we expect will generate\nsuggestions for improvements to your manual.\n<BR>\n&bull; Tuesday, April 16&mdash;A final revision of your manual is due at the beginning of class.\n As always, all previous versions (including the three copies edited by\nyour classmates) should be included with your paper submission.  In this\ncase, you must also turn in your disassembled components along with your\nmanual.  It&#39;s a good idea to re-read the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/139w/requirements.html\">Writing Assignment Requirements</A>\nsheet before submitting each assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4><B>Suggestions and hints:</B> You may find it helpful to start your manual\n  with a list of the components, describing and defining them so you can refer\n  to them later.  (Note how this mirrors the organization of many computer\n  programs.) <BR>\n  Some objects are best described in terms of modules, giving the instructions\n  for assembling each module separately, then explaining how to assemble the\n  modules into the whole object.  (Note again the close analogy with software!) <BR>\n  Organizational guides to the reader, such as section headings and a table\n  of contents, may also help the user of your manual follow the instructions\n  more easily.  But include these only if they&#39;re truly helpful; anything\n  can be overdone, and it&#39;s certainly possible to write a clear manual\n  with paragraphs of prose and nothing more.  (Interestingly, students in\n  most Humanities writing classes are forbidden from using organizational\n  aids like these, on the rationale that they make the writing job too easy\n  by letting the writer avoid coming up with clear prose to mark the transitions\n  between parts of the document.)  </FONT></P>\n<P><FONT  SIZE=4><B>What to do when you get to class with your manual and your components:</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT >The first rule of reading someone else&#39;s work\nis to be both honest and kind.  You don&#39;t do the author any favors by\nsimply saying, &quot;Yeah, it looks okay.&quot;  Don&#39;t be hesitant to\nsay what you understood or what you didn&#39;t; just do it pleasantly, helpfully,\nand professionally.</FONT></P>\n<OL TYPE=\"1\">\n<LI>\n  <FONT >Students should place their components and the three\ncopies of their manual at the front of the room.</FONT><font ><BR>\n<BR>\n</font></LI>\n<LI>\n  <FONT >Then each student should repeat the following three\ntimes:</FONT><font ><BR>\n<BR>\n</font>\n<OL TYPE=\"1\">\n  <LI>\n    <FONT >Take another student&#39;s components and a copy of\n      the manual.</FONT><font ><BR>\n      <BR>\n      </font>  </LI>\n  <LI>\n    <FONT >Following the manual&#39;s instructions, assemble\n      the components.</FONT><font ><BR>\n      <BR>\n      </font>  </LI>\n  <LI>\n    <FONT >As you work, mark on your copy of the manual any questions\n      that you wish it had answered, any assumptions that you had to make, or\n      any other aspects that were not clear.</FONT><font ><BR>\n      <BR>\n      </font>  </LI>\n  <LI>\n    <FONT >When you&#39;re finished, write on your copy &quot;Assembled\n      by&quot; and your name.</FONT><font ><BR>\n      <BR>\n      </font>  </LI>\n  <LI>\n    <FONT >Then find the author, show him or her your product,\n      and let the author make notes on any discrepancies between your assembly\n      and what the author intended.</FONT><font ><BR>\n      <BR>\n      </font>  </LI>\n  <LI>\n    <FONT >Finally, return the pieces and the manual to the front\n      of the room (where the remaining copies of the manual are).</FONT></LI>\n</OL>\n</LI>\n</OL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
