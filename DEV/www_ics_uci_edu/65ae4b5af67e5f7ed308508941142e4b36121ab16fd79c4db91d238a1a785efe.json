Kay</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=5>Activity 4: Design Exams for Your Course</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>For next time, think about the quizzes and/or exams you'll be giving in your class. If your course wasn't designed to include exams, pick one of these approaches:</font>\n</p><li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">Design an exam you'd give if your \ninstitution required that every class\nhave a final exam</font></li>\n<li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">Design a diagnostic test to give\nstudents at the beginning to make\nsure they have the necessary\nprerequisite knowledge and skills</font></li>\n<li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">Refine further your design for the \nmajor assignment(s)</font></li>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>Prepare three slides (give or take) and add them to your existing presentation:</font></p>\n<ol>\n  <li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">An outline of the exam structure in the course, showing where each exam would come in the course outline.  (The best way to do this would be to copy your class-by-class course outline and add each quiz or exam to the copy at the place where it would occur.) For each quiz or exam at this point, you'd just need a few words (e.g., &quot;First quiz, covering basics of O-notation, 20 minutes&quot; or &quot;First midterm, covering all topics through trees, 80 minutes&quot;).</font></li>\n  <font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\"><br />\n  </font>\n  <li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">A more detailed outline of the first quiz or exam. For each question, describe what you're testing, the form of the question, and its weight. For example:</font>\n  <ul><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">\n  <li>O-notation:  Give students code, ask them for\n         the O-notation of its execution time (10%)</li>\n  <li>Recursion:  Ask students to describe in English\n         what value a short recursive function returns (5%)</li>\n  <li>Binary trees:  Given a tree, produce its contents in the\n         order that a preorder traversal would visit them (5%)</li>\n  </font></ul></li>\n  \n  <br />\n  <li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">One page of actual questions from that first quiz or exam. Write the question(s) exactly as you'd give them to the students. (Remember back to vague, incomplete, ambiguous, or otherwise flawed exam questions you have seen, and avoid those characteristics.)</font></li>\n</ol>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>Please <!-- e-mail me a copy of your work by the night before class (any reasonably standard form is fine). Then--> bring an electronic version to class to present  (anything that will work with the classroom projection system is fine). Remember to combine this with your goals and outline from last time, so we can refer back to the previous material.</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>As always, feel free to send me e-mail or visit me with questions or comments.</font></p>\n<hr />\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/\"><font face=\"AGaramond\">David G.
