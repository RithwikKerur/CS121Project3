BACKGROUND</h4>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">DATA PROTECTION HISTORY</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Parallel to the legislative activities in Europe and overseas, a\nnumber of parliamentary\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\ninterventions were made in 1971 and 1977 in Switzerland. Based\non the work of two\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\ncommissions of experts, the Federal Council (Swiss government)\npresented in 1984 a draft law\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nfor the usual consultation procedure. While some fundamental\nprinciples were well received,\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nmany interested parties and organisations (including employers\u2019\nand industrial organisations)\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\ncriticised the regulation of private and public activities in\none single law. The principal criticisms\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nwere that the law was unduly complicated and bureaucratic. It\nwas also criticised for creating an\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nindependent data commission (instead of a data ombudsman).</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">In March 1988, having taken into account some of these comments,\nthe Federal Council proposed\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\na bill for a Federal Law on Data Protection (FLDP) to\nParliament. The new law was approved by\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nboth chambers on 19 June 1992. Under Swiss Law, this new\nlegislation could have been\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nsubmitted to the Swiss people for a referendum. However, the\nterm to ask for a popular vote\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nexpired on 28 September 1992 and the FLDP entered into force on\nfor 1 July, 1993.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The FLDP will be complemented by an executionary regulation to\nbe published in June 1993.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">ACTUAL LEGAL SITUATION</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Until the adoption of the new Swiss Law, data protection in the\nprivate sector was governed by\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nArticle 28 paragraph 1 of the Swiss Civil Code (SCC). According\nto its provisions, the treatment\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nof data is not allowed if it leads to a violation of the\npersonality or harms its honour or public\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nreputation.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Industry codes of practice and guidelines as well as provisions\nin established data protection\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\npractice provide additional protection in specific branches\n(e.g. medical sector, market research\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nand direct marketing). Data protection in the field of banking,\ninsurance and pension privacy is\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nassured by the well-known strict secrecy obligations in these\nareas.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Data protection in the public sector is based on Article 8 of\nthe European Convention on human\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nrights (ECHR). Several directives and regulations of the Federal\nCouncil are currently filling the\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\ngap in data protection until the FLDP becomes law. In 1981, a\nFederal Office for Data Protection\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nwas established. While most of the Cantons introduced cantonal\ndata protection laws to assure\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\ncompliance with the ECHR, the Federal government has no\nconstitutional power to legislate on\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\ndata protection in the cantons.\n</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<h4 ALIGN=\"LEFT\">II. FEDERAL LAW ON DATA PROTECTION</h4>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The FLDP provides for an overall framework and deals with data\nprotection using similar\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nprinciples applied in other countries. The law enhances the\nprotection of private persons provided\n</font>\n\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\nby the SCC and regulates in a more detailed manner the treatment\nof data by Federal authorities.</font>&nbsp; <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">Private persons need no previous licence to treat data and\nregistration with the Federal Data\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">Register is required only in certain specific cases. Although\nthe majority of interested parties\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">asked for separate treatment of the private and public sectors,\nthe law covers both to ensure\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">harmonised development and to facilitate the access of the\nindividuals to the data protection\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">system.\n</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Structure of the FEDERAL LAW ON DATA PROTECTION</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SECTION 1 OBJECTIVE, SCOPE OF APPLICATION AND\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">DEFINITIONS</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SECTION 2 GENERAL PROVISIONS ON DATA PROTECTION</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SECTION 3 TREATMENT OF PERSONAL DATA BY PRIVATE\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">PERSONS</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SECTION 4 TREATMENT OF PERSONAL DATA BY FEDERAL\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">AUTHORITIES</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SECTION 5 FEDERAL DATA COMMISSIONER</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SECTION 6 FEDERAL DATA COMMISSION</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SECTION 7 PENAL PROVISIONS</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SECTION 8 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n</font>&nbsp;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">MAIN PROVISIONS</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The purpose of the FLDP is to protect the privacy, interests and\nfundamental rights of data\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">subjects. Furthermore, it has as its central goal</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">* to maintain good data file practice; and</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">* to facilitate the international data exchange by providing a\ncomparable level of protection.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The FLDP has a very wide scope of coverage and applies to\npersonal data file activities carried\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">out by Federal authorities, private organisations and individual\nprivate persons (excluding normal\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">private purposes). While data collections kept by journalists\nand by the media are covered under\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">Article 10, they benefit from several additional exceptions\n(i.e. provisions regarding freedom of\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">the press and speech).</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The law covers data on private persons as well as on legal\npersons and applies to both Electronic\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">Data Processing (EDP) and manual files (Article 2, Article 3\nparagraph a). The transfer of data\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">abroad is not allowed if adequate data protection cannot be\nassured (Article 6 paragraph 1). A\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">prior notification of the cross-border transfer is needed except\nin cases of a legal obligation or if\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">the data subject has been informed, at least implicitly, of the\ntransfer.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Data must be collected lawfully and should be done in good faith\n(Article 4).&nbsp; Any treatment must\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">ensure accuracy and be balanced. They must be secured against\nunauthorised access.</font>&nbsp; <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">Furthermore, the data subject must be informed of the purpose of\nthe collection, have a right of\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">access (Article 8) and benefit from a right to correct errors\n(Article 5).</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Sensitive data - such as those relating to religion, political\nconvictions, trade union activities,\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">health, race, social assistance or criminal punishment - enjoy\nin several respects a more effective\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">protection.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">All data registers held by Federal authorities must be\nregistered with the Federal Data\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">commissioner. Private persons only have to register data\ncollections if they include sensitive data\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">or if they are communicated regularly to third persons and if\nthere is neither a corresponding legal\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">obligation nor information on the data subject (Article 11).</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Federal Council has the responsibility of establishing the\ndetailed rules relating to the\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">execution of the FLDP.</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font FACE=\"Times New Roman\"></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">PRIVATE SECTOR LEGISLATION</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Data collection by private persons must not harm the privacy and\npersonality of the data subject.</font>&nbsp; <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">In general, there is no violation if the data have been made\npublicly available without reserve to a</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">future treatment (Article 12 paragraph 3). The treatment can be\njustified by consent, by law or by</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">an overwhelming private or public interest, such as:</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">* data collection in connection with the conclusion of a\ncontract,</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">* credit information,</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">* research and statistics (provided no individual data subject\ncan be identified), or</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">* publication in media.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Private persons can mandate third parties to treat data on their\nbehalf if no secrecy obligation is</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">violated. In such cases, third parties may benefit from the same\njustifications as the file controller</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">(Article 14).</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">PUBLIC SECTOR LEGISLATION</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">In the public sector, the FLDP regulates the collection and\ntreatment of data by Federal authorities</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">only. The activities of cantonal and communal authorities are\ngoverned by cantonal law. The</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">major proportion of the Swiss cantons have introduced laws on\ndata protection in their area with</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">rules similar to those on Federal level.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Federal authorities may collect and treat personal data only if\nauthorised or to fulfil a legal</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">obligation (Article 17). Special rules apply for files held to\nfight certain criminal activities (e.g.</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">organised crime, terrorism) or to ensure military security\n(Article 24).</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Personal data can only be made available to third parties on a\nclear legal basis, to fulfil legal</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">obligations or in case of consent (Article 19). A data subject\u2019s\nname, address and birthday may be</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">communicated without the provision of legal grounds. Personal\ndata may only be used for</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">statistics, planning and research if (i.e. in case of\npublication) an individual person cannot be</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">identified (Article 22).</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">FEDERAL DATA COMMISSIONER</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Federal data commissioner (FDC) is appointed by the Federal\nCouncil and supervises the</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">compliance of Federal authorities with the FLDP (Article 27). In\nthe private sector, the FDC acts</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">as an ombudsman. The Commission can only investigate and give\nbinding decisions to private</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">persons in cases where data collections have been registered, in\ncases of cross-border transfers</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">and if the methods of data treatment endanger the privacy of a\nlarger number of individuals</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">(Article 29).</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">FEDERAL COMMISSION ON DATA PROTECTION</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Federal commission on data protection is appointed by the\nFederal Council and acts as an</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">appeal body against decisions of Federal authorities in relation\nto data protection as well against</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">cantonal judgements based on Federal public law on data\nprotection.</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">PENALTIES</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Private persons violating their obligations with respect to\ninformation, notification and granting</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">access to information can be punished with a fine or detention.\nUnauthorised access to sensitive</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">data can be punished with a fine or imprisonment, i.e. the data\nsubject enjoys all usual remedies</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">available under normal civil procedure (i.e. interdiction, right\nto correct or compensation of</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">damage).</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<h4 ALIGN=\"LEFT\">III. OBLIGATIONS OF FILE CONTROLLERS AND RIGHTS OF DATA SUBJECTS</h4>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">There is no obligation for private persons to establish formal\nprocedures or to ask for permission</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">before beginning a collection of data except in cases where\nsensitive personal data are handled or</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">where data are communicated to third persons and only if there\nis neither a legal obligation nor</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">any information of the data subjects concerned.</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">The data subject generally has the right to inspect and to\ncorrect false, incomplete or erroneous</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">data. This right may only be restricted if there are\noverwhelming public or private interests.</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">There, is however, no obligation of automatic notification as is\nthe case in other countries.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The file controller has the responsibility of assuring the\nsecurity of the data and is required to</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">prohibit unauthorised access. Under the FLDP, the Federal\nCouncil has the flexibility to issue</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">detailed prescriptions on security procedures not only in the\npublic, but also in the private sector.</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<h4 ALIGN=\"LEFT\">IV. INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION FLOW CONDITIONS</h4>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The FLDP restricts the transborder delivery of data in those\ncases when there is a need for the</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">protection of privacy. Delivery may be restricted if, for\nexample, the recipient\u2019s country cannot</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">provide an adequate level of data protection. A notification of\nthe FDC is only necessary if the</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">data subject has not been informed of such a transfer. However,\nsuch notifications may be</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">presumed in many cases. During the parliamentary debates, the\nFederal minister of justice</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">specified that, for example, such knowledge can be presumed if\npersonal data are exchanged</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">among different companies of a multinational group.</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">\n<h2 ALIGN=\"LEFT\">SWISS FEDERAL LAW ON DATA PROTECTION</h2>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">19 June 1992</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">The Federal Assembly of the Swiss Confederation,</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">regarding Articles 31 bis, paragraphs 64, 64 bis and 85, number\n1 of the federal constitution;</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">regarding the 23 March 1988</font><font FACE=\"Times New Roman\" SIZE=\"1\">1\n</font><font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">FF 1988 II 421 message of the Federal\nCouncil, decrees:</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Section 1: Objective, Scope and definitions</h4>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Article 1&nbsp; Objective</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This law seeks to protect the personality and the fundamental\nrights of those individuals about\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">whom data is processed.</font></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\"><font FACE=\"Times New Roman\"></p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Article 2</font>&nbsp; <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">Scope</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">This law regulates the processing of data about physical and\nlegal persons undertaken by:</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">a) private bodies</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">b) Federal bodies</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">It does not apply to:</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">a) Personal data which is processed by a natural person\nexclusively for personal use\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">and is not disclosed on to a third party;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">b) deliberations of the Federal Parliament and Parliamentary\nCommittees;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">c) pending civil, penal, international legal assistance\nprocedures as well as public\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">law and administrative regulations with the exception of\nadministrative\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">procedings of the first instance;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">d) public registers of private law;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">e) personal data processed by the International Committee of the\nRed Cross.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">Article 3</font>&nbsp; <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">Definitions</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">It is meant by:</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">a) personal data (Data): all information relating to an\nidentified or identifiable person,</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">b) persons concerned: the physical or legal person about whom\ndata are\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">processed,</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">c) sensitive personal data: data concerning:</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. religious, philosophical, political or union opinions or\nactivities,</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. health, sexuality or racial origin,</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. social security files,</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. criminal or administrative procedings and sanctions</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">d) personality profile, a collection of data which allows the\nappraisal of essencial\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">characteristics of of the personality of a natural person;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">e) processing, all operations relating to personal data -\nregardless of the equipment\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">and procedures used - in particular the collection, storage,\nuse, modification,\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">communication, archiving or the destruction of data;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">f) communication, rendering data accessible, for example by\nallowing access to data\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">by either transferring them or distributing them;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">g) file, a collection of personal data whose structure\nfacilitates a search for data on a\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">particular individual;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">h) Federal body, the authority or Federal service as well as any\nperson working for\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">the Swiss Confederation;</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">i) file controller, the private person or Federal body who\ndecides the purpose and the\n</font> <font FACE=\"Times New Roman\">contents of the file.</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">k) law, in the formal sense:</p>\n<p ALIGN=\"LEFT\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.
