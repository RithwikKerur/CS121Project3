It can also be shown by a simple induction on dimension\nthat, if f is the characteristic function of a compact convex set K,\nthen &chi;(f)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1: By induction, &chi;(f<sub>z</sub>) is the\ncharacteristic function of a closed interval, from which it is clear\nfrom the definition that sum&nbsp;D&nbsp;&chi;(f<sub>z</sub>) is&nbsp;1.\nThus also (since V has the characteristic\nfunctions of convex compact sets as its basis) &chi; is well defined\nindependently of the choice of coordinates for <b>R</b><sup>d</sup>.\n\n<P>If\ng is the characteristic function of the relative interior of a polytope\nK, it is in V<sup>d</sup> (by inclusion-exclusion of lower-dimensional\nfaces) and a similar induction shows that\n&chi;(g)&nbsp;=&nbsp;(-1)<sup>m</sup>, where m is the dimension of K:\nBecause of the independence of &chi; from the coordinate system, we can assume m=d.  Each cross-section of K is itself a polytope, so by induction\n&chi;(g<sub>z</sub>) is (-1)<sup>m-1</sup> times the characteristic function of an open interval, and the effect of the sum and D operators is to multiply by another factor of&nbsp;-1.\n\n<P>Now we let K be a convex polytope, and evaluate &chi; on its characteristic function in two different ways, by partitioning K into the disjoint union of the relative interiors of its faces.  By linearity of &chi;, the sum of its values on these relative interiors must be the same as its value on all of K, that is,\n<br><br>\n<div align=center>\n1&nbsp;=&nbsp;sum (-1)^m\n</div>\n<br>\nwhere the sum is over the set of faces of K (including K itself).\nGrouping the faces by their dimensions, we get a form of Euler's formula:\n<br><br>\n<div align=center>\n1&nbsp;=&nbsp;sum&nbsp;(-1)<sup>i</sup>&nbsp;f<sub>i</sub>\n</div>\n<br>\nwhere the sum runs from i=1 to the dimension of K.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
