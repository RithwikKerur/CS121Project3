2 points for submitting\r\n  48 hours (or more) early; a blank here means no extra credit/early submission\r\n  points.\r\n<p>\r\nColumns D and beyond show marks for the various parts of the assignment.\r\nThe last three columns show your <b>Score</b>, the score <b>Rounded</b> to an\r\n  integer (see the discussion below) and your <b>Percent</b>, based on the\r\n  number of points the assginment is worth.\r\nIf a cell contains a comment (those cells with a red-triangle in their\r\n  upper-right hand corner) you can hover over the cell and you will see the\r\n  comment that explains why the marks were given: sometimes you must right-click\r\n  the comment and then enlarge its bounding box to see the full comment.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Students should talk to the TA/Reader who graded a question, if they do not\r\n  understand why they received the marks they did or to dispute any of these\r\n  marks.</b>\r\nFor Programming Assignment #0, the grading was as follows\r\n<b><pre>\r\nPart A: Anna Raichev \r\nPart B: Karan Ramakrishnegowda \r\nPart C: Talha Khan\r\nPart D: Sastha Palaniappan\r\n</pre></b>\r\n<p>\r\nThe best time to talk with the TA/Readers about grades is during one of their\r\n  Labs, when both student and staff are physically present to examine the\r\n  submission and the grade, possibly running the solution on a computer they\r\n  can share.\r\nThe same goes for talking to other TAs/Readers.\r\nAll the TAs/Readers can download your work from Checkmate.\r\n<p>\r\n<li>The second file to examine stores the cumulative\r\n   <a href=\"ics33fal19grades.zip\">Grades(zipped .xlsm file)</a> -also available\r\n     as a link on course web- unzip it, and then click the tab labeled\r\n     <b>Spring 2019</b>.\r\n   This tab records all the grades for all the testing instruments that you\r\n     submit during the quarter.\r\nIt is also sorted by <b>Hashed ID</b>s (column A).\r\nYou will notice that in this spreadsheet all recorded grades are rounded up to\r\n  integers: so receiving a 27.5 on the first spreadsheet will translate into a\r\n  28 recorded on the second one.\r\nWe will use this same \"round-up\" process for recording all grades during the\r\n  quarter.\r\n<p>\r\nOn this spreadsheet, columns B-U contain your scores: for the Quizzes (B-I),\r\n  Programming Assignments (J-O), In-Lab Programming Exams (P-R), and Written\r\n   Exams (S and U: I'll discuss T after the Midterm).\r\nColumns V-Y contain the sums for all these testing instruments.\r\nColumn Z contains special extra credit points (for example, submitting the\r\n  faculty/course evaluation at the end of the quarter; more on this then).\r\n<!---\r\nIn fact, because this quarter all students submitted correctly and on time in\r\n  Checkmate, anyone submitting an assignment received one extra credit point,\r\n  which is listed here.\r\n---->\r\nColumn AA-AE contains your cumulative points WITHOUT nomalization points added\r\n  in (AA), your average WITH normalization points added in (AB), your rank in\r\n  class (AC: 1 means highest-scoring student), and your current grade (AD is\r\n  the letter, AE is +/- if appropriate).\r\n<p>  \r\nYou should check this spreadsheet after every assignment is graded to ensure\r\n  that your score was recorded correctly.\r\nAgain, students should talk to the TAs/Readers first, if this spreadsheet\r\n  contains any errors.\r\n<!---\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, there were 2 students who submitted work, but who are unregistered for\r\n  the course.\r\nTherefore, they have no ID Hashed, so their scores appear at the bottom with\r\n  <b>Unregistered</b> appearing in column A.\r\n--->\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMPORTANT</b>:\r\nScores wil revert to <b>0</b>, if I do not receive a signed Academic Integrity\r\n  Contract from you (we are tabulating them this week).\r\nPlease come by during my office hours as soon as possible if you need to fix\r\n  this problem.\r\nIf you turned in a document that was NOT printed double sided on a single sheet\r\n  of paper, it will NOT be counted: get a new sheet outside my office and\r\n  resubmit it to me in my office (or just slide it under the door).\r\nWe need to scan these documents, and anything other than a single sheet of\r\n  paper cannot be scanned (and might break the scanning machine).\r\n<p>\r\nThis assignment was designed to test you on whether you have mastered the\r\n   basics of using Python in Eclipse, the Eclipse Debugger perspective, and\r\n   batch-self-check files in the <b>driver.py</b> module (in <b>courselib</b>).\r\n It was also designed to see if you could follow instructions and ask\r\n    questions: more on that below.\r\n<p>\r\nThe class average was 11 (or about 108%) and the median was 11 (or about 110%).\r\nFor those students submtting work, there were\r\n  91% As, 4% Bs, 4% Cs, and 1% Ds and Fs.\r\n<p>\r\nThe assignment was not meant to be hard, but it was not trivial either, and\r\n  there were many opportunities to lose points (and learn from your mistakes).\r\nYour work in the Eclipse/Python Integrated Developement Environment (IDE)\r\n  throughout the quarter will leverage off the understanding and skills that\r\n  you acquired in this assignment.\r\n<p>\r\nLet me talk about what will probably be the most contentious half a point of\r\n  the 1,000 points that this course is worth (thus .05% of the grade).\r\n<!--- this point\r\n  was lost by about 14% of the students submitting work.--->\r\nI took off .5 points if you corrected the misspelling <b>Inteprxter</b> (and\r\n  took off 1 point if you didn't have either spelling: in this second case you\r\n  obviously failed to meet the specifications because you did not print what was\r\n  required).\r\nWhen some students hear about this point deduction, their heads explode and\r\n  they cannot believe that I am taking off a point for correcting what you\r\n  thought was my mistake.\r\nBut... I am trying to foster an atmosphere where nothing is taken for granted in\r\n  the instructions that I give: if anything seems confusing or plain wrong, I\r\n  should be questioned about it -preferably in public, in the appropriate\r\n  Piazza folder- so others can learn if there really is a problem, and if so\r\n  the correction.\r\n<p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\nSome students did ask me outside of class if they should correct the\r\n  misspelling, and I told them \"no\"; some students asked me by email if they\r\n  should correct the misspelling, and I told them \"no\"; one student asked in\r\n  Piazza folder whether they should have corrected the misspelling, and I\r\n  posted a reply saying that they shouldn't, for all students in the class to\r\n  see.\r\nIt is critical for programmers to be sure they know the specifications of the\r\n  problem they are being asked to solve, otherwise they will solve, test, debug\r\n  document, etc. the problem incorrectly, and another cycle of development will\r\n  be needed to fix the misconceptions.\r\nThe overview lecture included a graph that showed that the later in development\r\n  a problem is found, the harder/more expensive it is to fix.\r\nSo if we can find problems at the time we are reading the specification of the\r\n  problem to solve, that can save us a lot of work/money later.\r\n<p>\r\n<li>\r\nThe bottom line is that you are responsible for reading the instructions\r\n  carefully and reporting any confusion so that I can clear it up (best reported\r\n  in the appropriate Piaza folder).\r\nOf course, you can freely talk to anyone about the problem specifications, just\r\n  not the code that you write for your solutions.\r\nIf you make any assumptions (like the node names in Programming Assignment #1\r\n  always being one letter long -that is not part of the specification), they\r\n  might come back later to haunt you (gradewise).\r\nWhen working with a partner, you'll have two pairs of eyes reading the\r\n   specifications and looking for issues.\r\nI am willing to deduct this painful half point at the start of the quarter, from\r\n  many students, to get across this perspective, and save everyone grading grief\r\n  during the quarter.\r\nI hope you submitted early so the extra credit erased this point loss (see\r\n  below for the statistics on early submission).\r\n<p>\r\n<li>\r\nI will never intentionally do anything like this on subsequent assignments; but\r\n  I can certainly be unclear about the specifications (which have lots of\r\n  details) or even contradict myself from one spot to the next in a \r\n  specification.\r\nIt it up to you (the hundreds of eyes looking at my specifications) to clear up\r\n  the confusion, and best to do it on Piazza, so I can clear up the problem \r\n  once for all students.\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nHere is some insight into how the parts were graded.\r\n<ol type=\"A\">\r\n<li>\r\nThis part was worth 3 points: -3 points if nothing was submitted; -2 points\r\n  if running the code didnt print the right answer; -1 points for not\r\n  copy/pasting the big number in the output, and -5 points for correcting\r\n  the spelling of <b>Inteprxter</b> (described above).\r\n<p>\r\nAlso, we deducted .5 points on the <b>demo.py</b> program if your\r\n  <b># Submitter</b> line did not perfectly match what was required, including\r\n  using correct spacing, punctuation, lower-/upper-case letters, etc.\r\nMany students lost a half point here; ensure that you know what you did wrong\r\n  so you won't lose points in subsequent submissions.\r\nI'd  like to clear up all problems related to this issue immediately.\r\nMost deductions came from not using the correct special characters, not using\r\n  correct spacing, not using the correct \"case\" for letters, not writing your\r\n  UCInetID (instead writing your Student ID).\r\nIf you have a non-standard name and you think it was automatically graded\r\n  incorrectly, contact the TAs/Readers who graded this part with your argument. \r\n<p>\r\n<li>\r\nThis part was worth 2 points: -2 points if the code was not submitted or not\r\n  runnable; -2 points if running the code didnt print the right answer.\r\nMany students forgot to change <b>+=2</b> to <b>+=1</b> as described in the\r\n  instructions: the computer cannot detect such an error, so you must.\r\nSee the line in the problem specification that said,\r\n  <b>\"Fix this error in line 75 by changing the integer literal 2 into the\r\n  integer literal 1.\"</b>\r\n<p>\r\n<li>\r\nThis part was worth 3 points: we deducted .5 points for any mistake in each of\r\n  the 7 questions (but capped the total deductions at -3 points).\r\nSome students did not carefully read the instructions in the Debugger\r\n  Perspective document for the quiz part, which required them to change a line\r\n  in the <b>craps</b> script before running it with the debugger to gather the\r\n  required information.\r\nWith this change in your program, we can check your answers for correctness;\r\n  without it, we cannot check you answers for correctness (so all were counted\r\n  wrong).\r\n<p>\r\n<li>\r\nThis part was worth 2 points: we deducted 2 points for no submission; we\r\n  deducted 1 point of the final two lines were not.\r\n<b><pre>  Done batch_self_check: 9 correct; 6 incorrect\r\n  Failed checks: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</pre></b>\r\nAnd we deductioned -.5 points for any of the following:\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Comments not on lines 3, 11, or 19\r\n  <li>Didn't use a set in line 20\r\n  <li>Did not call <b>remove</b> (<b>discard</b> is OK too) in line 21\r\n  <ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, about 69% of the students submitted the program 2 or more days early;\r\n  about 11% submitted the program 1 day early.\r\nSo, about 80% of the students submitted this assignment early.\r\nKeep up the good work, although it will be harder in upcoming assignments.\r\nYou can earn 12 extra points if you turn in every Programming Assignment two or\r\n  more days early (upping your grade by 1.2%): for some students, this boost\r\n  will be enough to raise their final grade.\r\nOver the course of a two week assignment, it will be to everyone's benefit\r\n  -students and staff alike- if students try to finish and submit early.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IMPORTANT</b>\r\nIf you believe that we graded your work incorrectly, please examine the files\r\n  mentioned above first, then contact the TA/Reader who graded your work, to\r\n  discuss the issues with him/her.\r\nSuch a discussion can have only positive outcomes: either he/she will agree\r\n  with you that you deserve more credit (and, we do want you to receive all the\r\n  credit that you are due), or you will come to understand the question,\r\n  program, or solution better and realize why you lost points.\r\nThis is certainly a win-win situation.\r\nPlease read my solution and the <b>assignment grades</b> spreadsheet carefully\r\n  <b>before</b> contacting a TA/Reader; ensure that you understand what is the\r\n  correct answer and what points were deducted from your assignment and why.\r\nIf there is a problem, the TA/Reader will email me a revised summary about your\r\n  program, and cc a copy to you.\r\nI will update the grades spreadsheet as appropriate (it might take a bit of\r\n  time for all these events to cumulate in a changed grade) and email you\r\n  what I did.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you feel there is still an unresolved problem after talking to a TA/Reader,\r\n  please contact me (but always contact your TA/Reader first).\r\n<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Also, because of the size of this class, if you have a grading\r\n  issue, we will consider it only if you bring it to your\r\n  <b>TAs attention within a week of when I return the materials</b>.\r\nThis policy is in place to avoid an avalanche of work because of\r\n  \"grade-grubbing\" late in the quarter.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>\r\n  #6: 9/26/19<br>\r\n  Hashed ID\r\n</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  When we grade assignments, we often distribute/update various spreadsheets\r\n    with the relevant grading information.\r\n  These spreadsheets are indexed and sorted by each student's Hashed ID.\r\n  The course web-page has a <b>Find ID Hashed (grade key)</b> link (the\r\n    leftmost bottom/green link on the course web page) , which you can use to\r\n    retrieve your Hashed ID\r\n    (or click\r\n     <a href=\"https://support.ics.uci.edu/studentID/\" target=\"main\">\r\n       Find ID Hashed</a>).\r\n  Use the result it shows when examining any spreadsheets of grades;\r\n    I suggest that you find this number once, and write it down for future\r\n    reference.\r\n  <ul>\r\n  <li>Typically this website is not loaded with this quarter's information\r\n        until the middle of the first full week of classes.\r\n  <p>\r\n  <li>If you are an ACCESS student, this link may not work for you (check it\r\n        in the middle of the first full week of classes);

it uses (self-checking) test cases\r\n    that we supply with the assignments that we distribute (sometimes slight\r\n    variants).\r\n  You will learn about these tools in Programming Assignment #0.\r\n  Here are a few hints to ensure that you will understand the grading process\r\n    better and minimize your point loss.\r\n  <ol>\r\n  <li>Ensure that you submit the code you wrote, not empty files, nor the\r\n        original files that you downloaded.\r\n      Be very careful and <b>double-check</b> what you submit to avoid this\r\n        mistake: <b>if you are not sure that you submitted the correct code,\r\n        resubmit it</b>.\r\n      After submitting (the correct file) to <b>Checkmate</b>, ensure that it\r\n        shows the assignment's status as completely submitted.\r\n      Bottom Line: If you do not submit code with your solution (e.g., you\r\n        submit the wrong file), you will receive 0 points for the assignment.\r\n  <p>\r\n  <li>If you are submitting with a partner, ensure that the <b>Submitter</b>\r\n        and <b>Partner</b> lines of the program are correctly specified.\r\n      The names must appear in the exact format required, with no misspellings\r\n        nor punctuation errors.\r\n      The student listed as <b>Submitter</b> must be the one who actually\r\n        submits the code.\r\n      See the <a href=\"assignments.html\">Programming Assignments</a> web page\r\n        for the exact form required (and you must follow that exact form, with\r\n        no misspelling nor punctuation errors).\r\n  <p>\r\n  <li>Ensure that you submit your code on time.\r\n      We can, and mostly do, ignore any work submitted after the deadline\r\n        (even by a few minutes).\r\n      It is a fairness issue for other students who do submit on time.\r\n      The best strategy is to finish the work and submit it well before the\r\n         deadline (possibly getting extra credit points): by submitting early,\r\n         you will learn more too, if you aren't rushing to meet a deadline.\r\n      To ensure that we will grade something, submit partially complete code\r\n         ahead of the deadline; then, if you miss the deadline, we will still\r\n         grade the partially complete code.\r\n      Be warned: Checkmate can get bogged down if many students all try to\r\n        submit a few minutes before the due time, so do not wait until the\r\n        last minute to submit your code.\r\n      <b>Submit your code immediately when you finish;
