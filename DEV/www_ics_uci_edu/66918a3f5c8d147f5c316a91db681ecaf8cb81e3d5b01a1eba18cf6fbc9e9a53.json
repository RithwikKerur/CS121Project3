Chen <br>\nDepartment of Computer Science and Engineering <br>\nUniversity of Notre Dame <br>\nNotre Dame, IN 46556, USA <br>  \n</h2>\n\n<p>\nIn this talk, we introduce an interesting geometric graph called\n<i>multi-column graph</i> in the <i>d</i>-dimensional space (<i>d&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3</i>),\nand formulate two related combinatorial optimization\nproblems called <i>optimal net subgraph problems</i> on such graphs.\nOur formulations model a number of applied problems such as\nmedical image segmentation, surface reconstruction with a given \ntopology, and metric labeling.  We prove that the optimal net\nsubgraph problems on general <i>d</i>-D multi-column graphs\n(<i>d&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3</i>) are NP-hard.  For several important special cases of\nthese problems in <i>d</i>-D (<i>d&nbsp;&ge;&nbsp;3</i>)\nthat arise in real applications, we present deterministic\npolynomial time algorithms for computing optimal solutions.  \nOur algorithmic techniques enable us to achieve optimal solutions\nfor several applied problems in polynomial time, such as some surface\nreconstruction problems in 3-D and 4-D and medical\nimage segmentation problems in 3-D and 4-D.\nIt is interesting to note that a previous belief was that \nsome of these applied problems were NP-hard, and\nthe previously best known exact algorithms for these problems, even on \nrelatively simple cases, take at least exponential time.\nOur approaches can be extended to higher\ndimensions and to other more challenging versions.\nExperimental results on segmenting real medical images have shown the \neffectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
