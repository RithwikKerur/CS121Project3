Her \r\nfamily (father Jacob, mother Fritzi - both now deceased - and sister Miriam \r\nwho now lives in Indianapolis) grew up in the same apartment building as my \r\nfamily.  \r\n     \r\nDid you grow up in Brooklyn?  And in what section of Brooklyn is E. 32nd \r\nStreet.  I turned to the L1 section of the Langsam-Spira Family -- the only \r\nMoshe (not Moishe) I see is/was married to Sarah...???  but this seems to be \r\na couple of generations back?  or am I being misled by Moshe's position on \r\nthe chart?\r\n     \r\nUnfortunately...most of my immediate family is now gone.  My brother lives \r\nin Bayside and my Aunt (not a Langsam, but a Mink -- my mother's maiden \r\nname) - so I still get back to New York several times a year. There have \r\nbeen a couple of marriages (cousin Michael's -- not the Santa Cruz Michael, \r\nbut the Allentown PA Michael -- son and daughter have been married in the \r\npast few years) -- I don't know of other branches, however, that haven't \r\nmade it into the book. \r\n     \r\nBy the way, how did you manage to get connected with the Langsam-Spira volume?\r\n     \r\n     \r\nRe:  the \"net\" -- I've got great access both through the University and at \r\nhome -- so I'd be interested in tuning in to your site once it's \r\nestablished.  Keep me posted.  It might be interesting to establish a \r\n\"relative\" listserv or link.\r\n     \r\nI'd be interested to hear if and when you manage to contact Michael.\r\n     \r\nNice hearing from you.  Good luck. \r\n     \r\nBest:  Debbie\r\n     \r\n     \r\n     Hi,\r\n\r\n     I started off trying to create a record of my Miller ancestors that \r\n     perished in the Holocaust, a small task I had thought. It took on a\r\n     life of its own. I have about 6500 people now in the L1 section of the \r\n     book, all from Avrohm Aba Langsam/Miller. I am also in the midst of\r\n     putting up an internet site with some of the high-level info. Do u \r\n     have access to the 'Net?\r\n\r\n     I found a Michael M. Cohen, at Santa Cruz, with Email address: \r\n     mmcohen@mambo.ucsc.edu\r\n     Is this him?\r\n\r\n     I am married, with children. I live in Brooklyn, NY & work in \r\n     Manhattan for Prudential Securities.\r\n\r\n     Do you know of any other Langsams outside of your family, that did not \r\n     make it into the book, like any new students, etc?\r\n\r\n     Take Care!\r\n     -Moishe\r\n\r\n     Moishe Miller\r\n     1133 East 32nd Street\r\n     Bklyn NY 11210-4734\r\n\r\n     H:(718) 258 - 5512\r\n     W:(212) 778 - 7015\r\n\r\n\r\n     ______________________________ Reply Separator\r\n     _________________________________ Subject: Re: Genealogy\r\n     Author:  \"Dr. Deborah M.

But his parents are Sam \r\n     and Anita Cohen (as you probably know from the Langsam-Spira book).\r\n     Their address is as follows:\r\n\r\n     24 Littlebrook Road North\r\n     Princeton, NJ   08540\r\n\r\n     They're terrific people and I'm sure that they can help. \r\n\r\n     You might also try the internet for Michael:  he's on staff at \r\n     University of Calif. -- Santa Cruz (I believe that he's in the \r\n     Mathematics Department).\r\n\r\n     As far as Langsam news goes:\r\n\r\n     I'm not sure that my brother's (Jay Langsam) 3rd child is part of the \r\n     book. His name is Peter and he is approaching Bar Mitzvah age..\r\n\r\n     I'm also not sure that my marriage is listed: \r\n\r\n     I married Joal Fischer (although, as you know, I keep my Langsam name) \r\n     -- and as you can probably tell from my email, am on the faculty at\r\n     the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. \r\n\r\n     How about you -- where do you live and how have you become interested \r\n     in the genealogy?\r\n\r\n     Good luck in your search for Michael. \r\n\r\n     Debbie\r\n\r\n     Deborah M.
