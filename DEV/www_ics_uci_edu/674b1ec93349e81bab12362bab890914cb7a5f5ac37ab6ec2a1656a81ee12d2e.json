My name is <A HREF=\"http://ea.oac.uci.edu/indiv/eafg026/Scratch.html\">Chris Yellen</A>.  I am a graduating senior at the<A HREF=\"http://ea.oac.uci.edu/\"> University of California at Irvine</A>.  I have for the past four years majore\n\nd in Studio Art with a strong emphasis in Digital Imaging and Video.  I see the future of the Web as a way to place my art around the world.  I have been playing around with the Web for about a year but never considered it a viable tool for my art until I\n\n began taking <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">computer classes at UCI</A>.  Below is a listing of sites of interest I have found and some questions I have been able to solve while venturing on the World Wide Web.\n<hr>\n<H2 align=center>Points Of Interest</H2>\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/otis/otis.html\">\nOtis</A> This is a cool artist hangout that permits you to post or view work from other artists.\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.wired.com/Staff/justin/dox/HTML1.html#center\">\nWired Magazine</A> This is the HTML version of Wired Magazine.\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/elvis/elvishom.html\" >\nElvis' Home Page</A> No Home Page is complete with out paying homage to the King. \n</UL>\n<Hr>\n\n<H2>Contents</H2>\n<OL>\n\n<LI><A HREF=\"#Art\">Art And The Web</A>\n<LI><A HREF=\"#Commercial\">The Commercial Web</A>\n<LI><A HREF=\"#Entertainment\">The Entertaining Web</A>\n<LI><A HREF=\"#Search\">Navigating The Web</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#education\">Learning From The Web</A>\n\n</OL>\n<HR>\n\n<H2>The Questionable Web</h2>\n<HR>\n<A NAME=\"Art\"></A><P>\n\nAs stated above, I have an interest in how the World Wide Web will be shaped in the future.  Originally its design was structured around scientific information, but its recent developments in handling graphics has restructured if not opened up opportuniti\n\nes for a variety of art-based sites.  One way to enter this <A HREF=\"http://www.uky.edu/Artsource/artsourcehome.html\">virtual gallery</A> is to go to on of the many sites that specialize in art.  In fact many Universities and galleries have their own camp\n\nus exhibitions on display such as <A HREF=\"http://www.egallery.com/egallery/\" >The Electric Gallery</A>.  For those who are interested in posting their own art or videos, <A HREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS/\" >Otis</a> offers an e\n\nasy way to do this.  Your work becomes world wide and feedback can be e-mailed directly to the artist.  This type of electronic resume might put food on the plate of the starving artist.  Alas the Web offers the last uncensored wall to paint on.\n<p>\n<HR>\n<p>\n<A NAME=\"commercial\"></A>\nIf the Web can offer economic potential to the Artist it can also offer commercial applications for any field.  So far many banks and businesses have placed adds upon the Web.  You can visit <A HREF=\"http://www.commerce.net/directories/participants/allpar\n\nticipants.html\" >The Commerce Net</A>.  Here you can find information on many major corporations, a brochure on a bank or company such as IBM.  With better security for handling credit card numbers and personal checks, a electronic mall can offer exclusiv\n\ne products and services to the Web community.  <A HREF=\"http://www.mca.com/\">MCA Cyberwalk</A> is just one of the many virtual malls that you can visit.  Here one might buy that hard to get Weezer T-shirt or download the latest info on their favorite band\n\n. \n<p>\n<HR>\n<p>\n<A NAME=\"Entertainment\"></A>\nWhat good is the World Wide Web if it can't entertain?  Like most who enter the Web it is very easy to get distracted from your original goals by the many cool sites that exist.  In fact the WWW has changed the way of looking at information via computers.\n\n  For me, entertainment comes in films (especially <A HREF=\"http://www.musicbase.co.uk/movie/pulp/contents.html\"> Pulp Fiction)</A> Film is my biggest love.  <A HREF=\"http://www.ingress.com/users/spease/hw/hollyweb.html\">The Hollyweb On-line Film Guide</A\n\n> can tell me what films are in development, <A HREF=\"http://www.ingress.com/users/spease/hw/cineplex.html\">reviews</A> as well as a myriad of trivial information.   The WWW also brings you a variety of  magazines and newspapers into your computer from <A\n\n HREF=\"http://www.mojones.com/motherjones.html\">Mother Jones</A> to <A HREF=\"http://www.playboy.com/\" >Playboy.</A>  Soon books might even get published electronically on the Web.  In fact, you can now search for <A HREF=\"gopher://wiretap.spies.com/11/Boo\n\nks\">book </A>      titles stored on the net.  If unsure on were to go, visit <A HREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment\">Yahoo</A>, they have many different types of entertainment sites on the Web to chose from.\n<p>\n<HR>\n<p>\n<A NAME=\"Search\"></A>\nAbove I mentioned <A HREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/\">Yahoo</A> A site that can help you navigate your way through the anarchistic Web.  Still to fully strain all the juice from this orange different services and search engines were created, and \n\ncontinually pop up though out the WWW, each with a different task in mind.   Lycos (tm) is the catalog of the Internet.  The <a href=\"http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/\">The Lycos</a> web explorer, developed at <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/\">Carnegie Mellon Universi\n\nty</A>,\nsearches the World Wide Web every day (including Gopher and FTP\nspace), building a database of all the web pages it finds.  Another popular search engine is <a href=\"http://www.einet.net/\"> EINet Galaxy</a>.  Here also topics are organized under categories such as Arts and Humanities, Law and Recreation.  During the d\n\nay this site can get busy thus slowing down your searches.  Both Einet and Lycos allow one to put their own information in one of the categories.  <a href=\"http://www.cm.cf.ac.uk/htbin/AndrewW/Hotlist/hot_list_search.csh\">COMMA</a> uses forms to assist wi\n\nth searches.  This type of engine is common on many sites and helps with a more exact query.  And then there is <a href=\"http://www.netweb.com/cortex/cgi-bin/netsearch\">Netsearch</a>.  NetSearch is a unique tool for gathering widely dispersed information \n\nfrom the Internet.  The NetSearch Project allows simultaneous querying of a wide array of remote databases, plus immediate assimilation of results into a highly readable format.  Basically it does everything but look under the kitchen sink.  I deem these \n\nengines as the most important part of the Web.  Kinda like a road map for the information impaired W3 traveler.\n<p>\n<HR><p>\n<A NAME=\"education\"></A>\nOne might view the WWW as a lazy library,  a system that constantly spews out information for a viewer who never leaves the seat.  Still, does all this information educate?  I find that most of the subjects that I research on the WWW were opinionated as w\n\nell as educational (minus the human environment).  It raises issues on our changing interactions with society.  Can classes one day be taught through the WWW such as illustrated by the <A HREF=\"http://hcrl.open.ac.uk/virtualsummer.html\">Virtual Summer Sch\n\nool Project</A>?  I don't think society is ready to hang up human interaction so quickly.  Instead the Web might become a way to supplement your education.  Working to enhance not replace, sites such as <A HREF=\"http://www.si.edu/\" >The Smithsonian</A> of\n\nfer many different subject matter on-line.  This <A HREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Education/On_line_Teaching_and_Learning/\">On-line Teaching and Learning</A> will most likely become the standard in education.  Schools such as <A HREF=\"http://www\n\n.online.edu/index.htm\">The Online University</A> ,advertising on the WWW,  hope to reach and unite students who are geographically separated from each other and the campus.  The price of this education will probably rise with an increase in popularity, bu\n\nt then again ,<A HREF=\"http:// ea.oac.uci.edu \">who can put a price on an education?</A>\n<p>\n<hr>\n\n<p>\n\n<ADDRESS >Chris Yellen\n</ADDRESS><BR><ADDRESS>eafg026@ea.oac.uci.edu</ADDRESS> <P>\n<I>Last revised Febuary 16, 1995</I>\n</BODY>      \n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
