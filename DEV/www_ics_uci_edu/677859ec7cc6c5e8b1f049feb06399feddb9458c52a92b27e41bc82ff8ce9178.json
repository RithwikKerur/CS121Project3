She married Hersh Grumet who\r\npassed away in 1923. His parents were Avrohom and Chaya Grumet. Incidentally my\r\nmaternal grandmother was named after her and I know they were Bluzhover Chassidim. I\r\nwas in touch with Suzan Wynnne and looked at the Langsam genealogy book, but couldn't\r\nfind their names there.\r\nI have been doing family research for a long time and can't seem to discover Sora Langsam's\r\nancestors. Would you have any suggestions as to where I should continue my research?\r\nThank you so much.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nOn Fri, Oct 2, 2015 at 7:56 AM, <moishe@langsam.com> wrote:\r\nHi,\r\nCan you provide year of birth/passing for Sora?

According to the records I have,\r\nSara Langsam passed away before 1911. She was married to Hersh Grumet who was \r\nborn around 1849 in Siemuszowa and passed away in 1923 in Sunik. Her children \r\nwere Moshe Grumet (my great-grandfather who was born in Sunik in 1879 and moved \r\nto Pittsburgh [in 1910] and passed away in 1959), Mindel (Wedner, lived in \r\nPittsburgh), Meyer Binyamin (lived in Pittsburgh), Chaya (lived in Pittsburgh), \r\nRivka, Mechel, and maybe three other siblings.\r\n\r\nI have no information about any of Sara Langsam's siblings or ancestors.\r\nThank you very much for taking an interest. Any information you may have would be\r\ngreatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nTue, Jul 11, 2017 at 8:03 PM, <moishe@langsam.com> wrote:\r\nHello,\r\nThank you for your kind words and for your interest.

I did find one piece of \r\nhelpful information since I can't seem to find any clue of family members before \r\nSara Langsam and Hersh Grumet married. In your family tree there is a son of Pesach \r\nLangsam named Chaim Leib and it is written on the bottom that not much is known \r\nabout the daughters Chava, Ita, Pessel, and Golda except that they married into the \r\nPopper, Grumet and Bernstein families.\r\n\r\nMaybe that is why I have been having such a hard time tracking down my ancestry. There \r\ndoesn't seem to be much information available. I looked through the Langsam book once \r\nbut couldn't find anything; it was very quickly on a Shabbos afternoon. Is there any \r\nway I can get a copy of the book so I can go through it in more depth?\r\n\r\nThank you so much again -\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\nSubject: Fwd: Sora Langsam - Grumet\r\nFrom: My Dodda \r\nDate: Thu, Jul 20, 2017 2:19 am\r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com\r\n\r\nThank you for your email. I am resending the information that I previously sent you \r\nand have added an addendum with bits of information that I found.\r\n\r\nAccording to the records I have, my great-great grandmother Sara Langsam from Sunik \r\npassed away before 1911. She was married to Hersh Grumet who was born around 1849 in\r\nSiemuszowa and passed away in 1923 in Sunik. Hersh Grumet's parents were Avrahom and\r\nChaya Grumet. Sara and Hersh Grumet's children were Moshe Grumet (my great-grandfather\r\nwho was born in Sunik in 1879 and moved to Pittsburgh [in 1910] and passed away in 1959),\r\nMindel (Wedner, lived in Pittsburgh), Meyer Binyamin (lived in Pittsburgh), Chaya (lived\r\nin Pittsburgh), Rivka, Mechel, and maybe three other siblings.\r\n\r\nI have no information about any of Sara Langsam's siblings or ancestors.\r\n\r\n\tIncidentally my maternal grandmother was named after Sara Langsam and I know\r\n\tthey were Bluzhover Chassidim. I was in touch with Suzan Wynnne and looked at\r\n\tthe Langsam genealogy book, but couldn't find their names there.\r\n\r\nAddendum:\r\nSarah and Hersh Grumet likely had nine children. They may have married in 1879. The \r\noldest Mindel was born in 1876 and passed away in Pittsburgh at the age of 96. She \r\nmarried Avrohom Wedner who was born in 1873 in Sunik. Rivka was born in 1882, Mayer \r\nBinyamin was born in 1886 and he married Rivka Mallinger born 1890 in a Sunik village \r\n\"Pielnia\" but they married in Pittsburgh. Chaya was born in 1890.\r\n\r\nHersh Grumet had at least two siblings: Shmuel b. 1847 and d. 1923 Sunik, and Roiza b \r\nabout 1849 and there married Yosef Grumet.\r\n\r\nAvrahom and Chaya were born before 1827.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother Sara Grumet came over with her mother Miriam who married Moshe (who left\r\nto America first) around 1921 on the Aquitania to Ellis Island. Miriam (Wertenteil or \r\nBertenthal) was born in Przysietnica in the district of Brzozow.\r\n\r\nI know this mainly deals with the Grumet family - that is why I am so lost when it \r\ncomes to the Langsam family.\r\n\r\nIf you can be of any help, I will be so grateful.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, have a Good Shabbos and thank you once again.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 7/26/2017</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "UTF-8-SIG"}
