There are many sides to this issue, and the folks arguing do not even agree on the definition of Net Neutrality. See the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality\">wikipedia entry on Net Neutrality</a> for an overview, but beware that it does not represent all views.</p>\r\n      <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Body\">In 2015, the FCC passed net neutrality regulations. The regulations contain a number of provisions. In this case study, we only consider the &quot;no throttling&quot; rule that is part of the FCC's 2015 Open Internet Order. Specifically, your role is to decide whether some service plans offered by mobile broadband Internet access service providers violate the &quot;no throttling&quot; rule.</p>\r\n      <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Body\">Net neutrality is the hottest current Internet public policy debate. It is likely that these regulations will be revisited by the FCC. In addition, Congress continues to debate the issue. </p>\r\n      <p align=\"justify\" class=\"Body\">Here are materials to prepare for the case study:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <LI><a href=\"../slides/convergence.pdf\">My slides</a> from lecture.         \r\n        <LI>Read the Congressional Research Service's <a href=\"R40616.pdf\">The Net Neutrality Debate: Access to Broadband Networks</a> to get an introduction to Net Neutrality and the issues surrounding it. These reports were prepared for members of Congress to learn about the issue.\r\n        <LI>Read parts of the FCC's <a href=\"https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-15-24A1.pdf\">2015 Open Internet Order</a>, which implements regulations. Read the justification for creating regulations on pages 3-7, and an executive summary of the rules on pages 7-12. The provision we will focus on is the &quot;no throttling&quot; rule, which is discussed on pages 51-53, and the &quot;reasonable network management&quot; exception, which is discussed on pages 99-104. You can find the FCC commissioners' arguments for and against the Order on pages 314-400.      \r\n        <LI>Carefully read the mobile broadband providers' explanations of their network practices:\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>AT&amp;T: Read about &quot;<a href=\"https://www.att.com/offers/streamsaver.html\">Stream Saver</a>&quot;, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.att.com/gen/public-affairs?pid=20879\">general description</a> of their network practices.</li>\r\n            <li>Sprint: Read about what &quot;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170201174957/https://support.sprint.com/support/article/Sprint-Launches-Unlimited-Freedom/0db2c4e7-3a6a-4d46-9dff-84cd6c402527\">mobile optimized</a>&quot; means, as well as a <a href=\"https://www.sprint.com/legal/open_internet_information.html\">general description</a> of their network practices.</li>\r\n            <li>T-Mobile: Read about &quot;<a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html\">Binge On</a>&quot; and about &quot;video optimization&quot; on their ONE and ONE Plus plans (see the fine print on <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans.html\">this page</a>), as well as a <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/company/company-info/consumer/internet-services.html\">general description</a> of their network practices.</li>\r\n            <li>Verizon: Read about &quot;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20170708015126/https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/video-optimization/\">video optimization</a>&quot;.</li>\r\n          </ul>        \r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>Here are links to media coverage:      </p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/12/23/youtube-is-accusing-t-mobile-of-degrading-videos-and-violating-net-neutrality/\">The Washington Post</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/01/07/t-mobile-ceo-calling-binge-on-throttling-is-bullshit/\">Engadget</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/TMobile-Less-Than-1-Turn-Off-Binge-On-Throttling-137983\">DSL Reports</a></li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>Here are links to a few lobbyist arguments:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/eff-confirms-t-mobiles-bingeon-optimization-just-throttling-applies\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://cdt.org/files/2016/01/CDT-Zero-Rating_Benefits-Harms5_1.pdf\">Center for Democracy and Technology</a><i></i></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://www.publicknowledge.org/press-release/public-knowledge-finds-binge-on-changes-a-step-forward\">Public Knowledge</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2015/12/t_mobile_s_binge_on_program_likely_violates_net_neutrality.html\">Future Tense</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10624728623811/Ex%20Parte%20Notification%20(June%2023%2C%202016).pdf\">T-Mobile</a></li>\r\n        <li><a href=\"https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/1072624402822/Binge%20On%20Small%20Providers%20Letter%20-%2007%2026%202016.pdf\">some small content providers</a>      </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p><strong><em>If you are a Lobbyist:</em></strong></p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>Pretend that someone has petitioned the FCC that one or more of these mobile broandband plans violates the throttling rule.
