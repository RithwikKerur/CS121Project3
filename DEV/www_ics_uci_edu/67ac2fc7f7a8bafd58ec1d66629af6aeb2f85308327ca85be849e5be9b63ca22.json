How can I decide whether two knots K and L are mutants of one another?\n\nWell, the conclusive method would be to find all possible ways to repeatedly\nmutate K, which is not easy, but I think it is possible by Haken's\nalgorithms for incompressible surfaces.  By Thurston geometry, a knot\nhas only finitely many mutant equivalents.   In the main case, when\nK is hyperbolic, mutation preserves hyperbolic volume, and there are\nonly finitely many hyperbolic manifolds with a given volume.\n\nIf you consider Haken-type algorithms too laborious, you can in\npractice use various invariants to try to conclude that two knots\naren't mutants.  As already mentioned, there is hyperbolic volume.  But\nalso there is the Dehn invariant, as Danny Ruberman explained to me.\nRecall Hilbert's problem of determining when two polyhedra are\nequivalent by polyhedral dissection.  Dehn found an invariant beyond\nvolume which distinguishes, for example, cubes from regular tetrahdra.\nAs it happens, the Dehn invariant also works in hyperbolic geometry,\nand moreover if two polyhedral are fundamental domains for the same\nhyperbolic group, they are dissection equivalent.  So hyperbolic\ngroups have a Dehn invariant too.  Finally, mutation can also\nbe understood as a polyhedral dissection in the hyperbolic case,\nso mutation classes have a Dehn invariant also.\n\nRuberman also told me that the Dehn invariant is a projection of\nthe Chern-Simons invariant of a hyperbolic manifold (this is not\nthe same as the Chern-Simons path integral of Witten).  I do not know\nwhether Chern-Simons detects mutation.\n\nBesides hyperbolic geometry, you can also consider quantum invariants.\nFollowing Reshetikhin and Turaev and a little bit of Witten, a compact\nLie group G and an irreducible G-module V determine a polynomial knot\ninvariant.  It is well-known that when G = SL(n), O(n), or SP(2n), the\ninvariants for all V's come from cablings and twisted cablings of\nHOMFLY or Kauffman.  (I am principally excluding representations of\nSpin(n) and exceptional Lie groups.)  It was noticed early on that many\nof these invariants are mutation invariant.  Here a broad condition on\nthe pair (G,V) that suffices for mutation invariance of the\ncorresponding knot polynomial:  V tensor V should be multiplicity-free,\ni.e., it should be a direct sum of distinct irreducible summands.  This\ncondition is almost certainly also necessary, although I do not have a\ncomplete argument in my head for the exceptional groups and spinorial\nrepresentations (except I think that I have a complete argument for\nG_2).\n\n&gt;2.) In which case is a knot K the only knot within its mutancy class?\n\nFirst, to mutate, you need to find a four-point tangle in K which is\nnot rational.  In some cases, such as all torus knots I think, no such\ntangle exists.  Also, in the hyperbolic case, if there is only one knot\nof the same volume as K, then mutation on K must yield K.\n\n&gt;3.) Is a Vassiliev-invariant v(i) known such that there exist (non-equivalent)\n&gt;    knots K and L, mutants of each other, and v(i)(K)&lt;&gt;v(i)(L)?\n\nSure.  The derivatives at q=1 of quantum invariants are of Vassiliev type.\nConsider a quantum invariant from a pair (G,V) where V tensor V is\nnot multiplicity free; for example you can take G = sl(n) for n&gt;3\nand V to be adjoint.  Then the quantum invariant will detect mutation.\n\nMore explicitly, for a knot K, take the bidirectional 2-cabling, i.e.,\nreplace K by two parallel copies of K, and orient one in direction and\nthe other in the other direction.  Then HOMFLY of this 2-cabling should\ndetect mutation in K most of the time.\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
