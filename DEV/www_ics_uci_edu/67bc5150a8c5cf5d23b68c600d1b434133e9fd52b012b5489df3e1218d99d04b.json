The entire town of Krakow, including Kazimierz, had 1,772 buildings. Thus, \nthe Jewish Ghetto contained 11.7% of the total housing stock. It is of interest that the \npopulation of Krakow in 1804 was 25,750, of which 4,300 were Jewish. The Jews \nconstituted 16.7% of the total population but occupied only 11.7% of the housing. Not \nsurprisingly, this indicates that the Jews, hemmed as they were in a Ghetto, were more \ncrowded than everybody else. While in Krakow as a whole there were 16.7 people per \nhouse, in the Jewish section the ratio was 20.8.\n<P>\nIn various records the occupation of Jozef Aleksandrowicz was given as merchant. For \nexample, he is listed as such in the detailed listing of the marriage of his daughter Temerl, \nin 1827. The details of that marriage are written in elaborate calligraphy and occupy a full \npage in the bound volume that constitutes the list of all Jewish marriages in Krakow in \nthat year. Jozef is listed as having died previously and as having been indeed a merchant. \nHowever, in the next family document discovered in the Krakow Archives, the 1831 \nrecord of the second marriage of his widowed young (22-year-old) daughter, Rywka, the \nbride's deceased father is said to have been an owner of a building in Kazimierz. In all the \ndocuments, for sixty or seventy years after 1802 the address of all the Aleksandrowicz \nfamilies is invariably given as building 203. It is logical to assume that this was the \nbuilding that Jozef owned. Not only did he live there from the day he married until his \ndeath sometimes after 1821 and before 1827, but his widow Dobrysz lived there until her \ndeath sometimes after 1847 and the families of both their sons, Menashe and Izrael Eliasz \nlived in 1850 and beyond. Only the census of 1881 shows a different address.\n<P>\nThe building Nr. 203 is a large three-story structure. The building is still standing and is \nin good repair and inhabited by many families. I have reasons to believe that its present \naddress is Jozefa Street 22. When I visited the building in October 1997 I was told by its \ncurrent inhabitants that it is the oldest standing apartment building in Kazimierz. The \nbuilding is now open on one side, the neighboring structure having been demolished. \nFrom that open side one can see that each floor has an open wooden outside corridor and \nthe building is rather attractive although undoubtedly very old. The size of building 203 \ncan be seen from its listing in the careful Polish census undertaken in 1790-1792, \nentitled: \"Spis ludnosci w Miescie Zydowskim Kazimierzu, przy Krakowie, w \nWoiewodztwie i Powiecie Krakowskim lezacym, przez Rabina Synagogi y Duchownych \nczyniony\" (Population census in the Jewish Town Kazimierz  by Krakow, located in the \nDistrict and Province of Krakow, performed by the Rabbi and Clergy of the Synagogue) \n(Table I):\n<P>\n<P>\n                                                               TABLE    I\n<P>\n                 Listing of inhabitants of Building 203 in Kazimierz by Krakow \n<P>\n(as copied from the 1790-2 census located in the Krakow branch of the Polish National\n          Archives, in original Polish) [see Table  II  for an English translation]\n<P>\n<PRE>\n______________________________________________________________________________\n No.domu        Nazwiska            Meszczyzny       Lata   Bialoglowy   Lata\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     203        Maier Dranes             1            53\n                    Zona Keila                                   1         50\n                Hierszel Pieczetarz      1            30\n                    Zona Sorla                                   1         20\n                Fewel Kalmans            1            24\n                    Zona Hinda                                   1         24\n                Mojzesz Ziec Szmerla     1            30\n                    Zona Rochla                                  1         40\n                Chaym Ayzykowicz         1            40\n                    Zona Fayga                                   1         36\n                Abram Herszkowicz        1            45\n             \t    Zona Rochla                                  1         40\n                    Corka Tauba                                  1         22\n                Jebel Rzeznikowicz       1            40\n                    Zona Itla                                    1         36\n                    Syn Hierszel                                 1         20\n                Mojzesz Krawiec          1            71\n                    Zona Rochla                                  1         30\n______________________________________________________________________________\n</PRE>\n<P>\n<P>\n \nObviously, the listing omits children. It is likely that it also omits some adult inhabitants \nwho did not want to be registered, for example, individuals who came from neighboring \nsmall towns and villages, but did not have the valuable and coveted permit to reside in \nKrakow. Such individuals lived as unregistered boarders, sheltered by registered friends, \nrelatives or business associates. From the census, we can infer that in 1790-2 in building \n203 lived at least eight families, a total of 18 adults. Several things can be deduced from \nthis list. If Jozef who became Jozef Aleksandrowicz had lived in Building 203 in 1790-2, \nhe would not have been listed, because he was only 8 years old at the time of the census. \nHowever, if, as I assume, his father's name was Herschel and his grandfather David, than \nthe family did not live in this building and probably did not own it then. Thus, it appears \nthat the family acquired this house after 1792 but before 1802. As can be seen from the \nTables, nobody in this house had a surname in 1790-1792. Individuals were identified by \ntheir own profession: such as \"seal maker\" or \"tailor\", their father's profession: \"son of \nthe butcher\", their father's name: \"Kalman's\", \"son of Hershel\", \"son of Isaac\", or even \nby relationship to a better known person, such as: \"son-in-law of Shmerl\". I also found it \ninteresting that the 71-year-old tailor had a 30-year-old wife, and that women were listed \nas white-haired. This may sound peculiar, but it is the exact translation of the Polish term \nused in the census.\n<P>\n<P>\n                                                                   TABLE   II.\n<P>\nInhabitants of building 203 in Kazimierz/Krakow in 1790-2.

Throughout most of the \nnineteenth century Dobrysz, Jozef's widow, and both sons and their families lived in \nbuilding 203. The first indication that the family moved, perhaps after the death of the \nmatriarch Dobrysh, the first record of a different address occurred in the birth certificate \nof Malka Reisel Aleksandrowicz, born on January 23, 1874, daughter of Menashe's son, \nJozef Aleksandrowicz and his wife Rachel nee Drezner, who in 1874 lived in a desirable \nbuilding, No. 169, on today's Kupa Street, next to the Isaac Synagogue. The census of \n1881, Volume 100-174, of District VIII of Krakow shows that building No. 168 housed \nthe Isaac Synagogue (Boznica Izaka) and no inhabitants. The building listed next, No. \n169, on Kupa Street, had only three apartments. In apartment No.1 lived Menashe \nAleksandrowicz. Menashe was born in 1818, so in 1881 he was 63 years old. According \nto the census, he lived alone, a widower, his wife, Lea nee Katzner, having died earlier. \nIn the census, his religion was given as Israelite, his language as German, and his \nprofession as a seller of victuals. He was said to be a permanent inhabitant of Krakow, \ni.e. he had the official right to reside in Krakow, and he was able to read and write.\n<P>\n On a separate page of the 1881 census, was listed Menashe's son, Jozef, living in \napartment No. 2. This Jozef, born in 1845, was named after his grandfather, Menashe's \nfather. He, too, was described as a permanent resident of Krakow, able to read and write. \nHis religion was given as mosaic, but, interestingly, his language was listed as Polish. He \nwas said to be engaged in commerce along with his father. With him in apartment No.2 \nlived his wife Rachel, daughter of Szaia Jozua Drezner, born in 1847, and his children, \nJakub, born 6 June 1866, David, born 24 June 1867, Hana, born 1869, Malka, born 1873, \nSzyja (later known as Jozua), born 1877 and Rywka, born 1879. Attached to the page was \na separate sheet of paper, issued and glued in on May 1, 1881, a birth certificate of \n\"Jakub Aleksandrowicz, son of Jozef and Rachel\", certifying that he was born in Krakow \non June 6, 1866. The document was signed by one \"Wenner, deputy clerk maintaining \nisraelite metrical records in Krakow\". This Jakub Aleksandrowicz was a grandson of \nMenashe and eventually became  my grandfather.\n<P>\n In apartment No. 3 of building 169 lived the family of Izrael Eliasz Aleksandrowicz, \nbrother of Menashe, youngest son of the first Jozef Aleksandrowicz and uncle of the \nsecond Jozef. Izrael Eliasz was born in 1821. He was listed as a commercial agent. With \nhim lived his wife Ester and children Reisel, born 1860, Nachman, born 24 November \n1864 and Elke, born 1867. Attached to this page, on a separate sheet was a document \nissued 30 December 1880, stating that \"Aleksandrowicz Nachman, son of Izrael Eliasz \nand Ester\", was born in Krakow on November 24, 1864. This document was also signed \nby the deputy clerk Wenner. While I was in Krakow in 1997 I visited the Krakow \nMiodowa Street cemetery and there I saw a new,  post-war, tombstone commemorating \nNachman Aleksandrowicz.\n<P>\nRecords show that Jakub Aleksandrowicz, grandson of Menashe, gradually moved \nfurther and further away from the crowded Jewish area in Kazimierz, yet not too far away \nfrom the bulk of Jewish population. That meant that he was moving to the area of \nStradom, which straddles between the old Jewish Town in Kazimierz and the city center \nof Krakow (Srodmiescie). Stradom area approaches the royal palace and castle hill of \nWawel. In 1874 Jakub lived on Dietla Street, a street that was created by filling the bed \nof the old Vistula River, the river that used to separate Krakow from Kazimierz (The \nriver bed moved further south and now separates Krakow, including Kazimierz, from the \ndistrict of Podgorze). In 1890 Jakub and family lived on Koletek Street, only one block \naway from the castle hill. Sometimes around 1906 Jakub Aleksandrowicz purchased from \na family named Metzger two large apartment houses directly opposite the Royal Castle \non Wawel Hill and overlooking the Vistula River, on Bernardynska Street, corner of \nSmocza Street. This is the premier location in Krakow, it just can not be improved upon. \nBernardynska Street, the southern access to the castle, is named after the imposing \nBernardine Cloister located  at its corner with Stradom Street. Smocza Street is named \nafter a dragon  (Polish: smok), which, according to legend, lived in a cave under the \nWawel Hill. After my grandfather Jakub's death in 1935, the two houses, cream-colored \nand with elaborate fronts, many balconies and original stain-glass windows in the \nstaircases were inherited by his sons and daughters, i.e. my father and his siblings. Three \nof my uncles died in the Holocaust, one died in Soviet Central Asia, one uncle and my \nfather, Maksymilian Aleksandrowicz, known later as Max Alexander, died in New York. \nI consider myself the rightful inheritor of the houses, even though they were taken over \nafter the 1939-1945 War by the Polish Communist authorities as \"abandoned property\" \nand I have not been able to recover them.\n<P>\nThe houses are still in very good repair, the location is absolutely fabulous, as close as \npossible to the Royal Complex, ramparts, Renaissance palace and Baroque cathedral that \nis the See of the Archbishop of Krakow. In the 1930's, Prince Adam Stephan Cardinal \nSapieha was the archbishop. His successor was Carol Cardinal Woytyla, who eventually \nbecame Pope John Paul II. The two houses together have 26 apartments. In 1939 I and \nmy father, mother and sister lived on the second floor of the corner house, Bernardynska \n11. Our apartment had a balcony facing the Castle and the Vistula River. From my \nbedroom window I could see the round castle keep, the so-called Sandomierska Tower.  \nMy uncle Jozek and his family lived next to us. On the ground floor lived my aunt Sonka,  \nwith her husband and son and my grandmother on my mother's side. On top floor, in an \napartment with a spectacular view of the castle and the Vistula River lived my aunt Lola. \nIn the next building, Bernardynska 10, lived my uncle Olek with his family, and my step-\ngrandmother, Toni. The houses are now fully occupied but I do not know the present \ninhabitants or administrators. Our old apartment is occupied by a real estate company, \nwith a big and unsightly advertising sign on the balcony.\n<P>\nOther branches of the family had comparable histories. Menashe Aleksandrowicz had \nthree sons. My father was a grandson of the eldest son, Jozef. The next son, Filip and his \nwife, Dorothea, nee Fraenkel, moved to the area of Podgorze, a part of Krakow lying on \nthe other side of  the Vistula. There they became major owners of real estate, including a \nflagship house, still in family hands, the building overlooking the river, at Przy Moscie 1 \n(By the Bridge 1). The bridge is gone, a new bridge is located further down the river, but \nthe house stands and is in good condition and fully occupied. The widow and children of \nthe third son of Menashe Aleksandrowicz, Wolf, moved to the northern part of Krakow. \nWolf's son, David, lived with his family in an elegant  house that he owned at 4 Biskupia \nStreet in the Krowodrza/Kleparz area of Krakow. \n<P>\nThe listing of houses owned or occupied by my ancestors, the Aleksandrowicz family, \ndescribed above, can serve as  typical for a reasonably well-off Jewish family in Krakow \nover a period starting around 1800. \n<P>\n                                                         Selected bibliography:\n<P>\nPrimary sources:\n[Mostly found in the Polish National Archives in Krakow, ul.
