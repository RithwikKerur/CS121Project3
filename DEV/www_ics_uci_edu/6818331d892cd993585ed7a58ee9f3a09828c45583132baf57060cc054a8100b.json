You'll also gain experience in working with a partner; working in a team is a common industry practice that, when properly done, produces better programs &#151; and faster than when a person works alone.\n</p>\n<p>This course is also listed as ICS 80, Java as a Second Language, to allow students with an alternate prerequisite list to enroll. For simplicity, we&#146;ll refer to this class as ICS 45J, though it is indeed both ICS 45J and ICS 80.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"Prerequisites\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Prerequisites </h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>The prerequisites for ICS 45J is a grade of \"C\" or better in ICS 33 or CSE 43 or an equivalent course with a grade of \"C\" or better (or its equivalent) from another educational institution. The Registrar normally drops from ICS 45J any student who enrolled in it but did not complete (or have on record equivalents for) the prerequisites. This quarter, all currently enrolled students have had their prerequisites verified, so you are \"cleared\" to take this course.</p>\n\n<p>Please be aware that <i>it is an act of academic dishonesty to intentionally add this course without the prerequisites or the instructor&#146;s permission.</i></p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<a name =\"Enrolling\"></a>\n<h3>Enrolling in ICS 45J</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Procedures for dropping the class, petitioning to add the class, changing your grade \noption and related matters are discussed in <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/EnrollmentInformation.html\">Enrollment Information</a>. ICS 45J  and ICS80 use different course codes; be sure you use the one for the course in which you are enrolled or wish to add. You can find these codes at the  <a href=\"http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/perl/WebSoc?YearTerm=2012-92&ShowFinals=1&ShowComments=1&Dept=I%26C%20SCI&CourseNum=45%2C80\">ICS45J/ICS80 WebSoc page.</a>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"LectureAndLab\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Lecture and Lab</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p><b>Lecture: </b>Lecture is where we impart course material and where you take the midterm\nand final exams. <p>Lectures and lab assignments for ICS 45J are intimately connected: lectures will present the concepts underlying the lab exercises you are to do; the assignments will give you practice applying some of the ideas presented in lecture. We encourage you to attend each lecture; if you miss one, we suggest that you arrange with your classmates to borrow their notes, and come to office hours to ask any questions about the issed material you still might have.  In addition to the usual reasons to attend lecture, note that some course material discussed in lecture is not in the textbook.</p>\n\n<p><b>Computer Labs:</b> The Bren School provides you acccess to Computer Labs, rooms where computers and software is available to help you complete lab assignments. You may work in any instructional ICS lab (ICS 183, 189 192, 364) any time it is open and not reserved for a particular class or function. The reserved and open hours for all lab rooms are on the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/lab_schedule/index.php\">ICS Lab hours</a> Web page and often on the labs&#146; doors.</p>\n\n<p>A lab attendant watches over equipment and can help you\nwith things such as answering questions about your computer account, reviving\na &#147;dead computer&#148; or adding paper to a printer. <i>An attendant\ncannot help you with your ICS45J work</i>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Lab Use Policies:</b> In order to use our computer equipment and computer\naccounts, you must agree to abide by UCI&#146;s and ICS&#146; policies regarding\nthem. The documents that describe these policies are kept on the Web; perhaps\nthe best way to access them is from the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/policies/labguidelines.php\">ICS Instructional Lab Guidelines</a> web page. Read this page, and follow\nits links to read the other pertinent ICS and UCI documents.</p>\n\n<p>Additional information about the lab rooms, their equipment, how to print in Labs, and software is in the \n<a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/LabManual/02-OrientationToLab.html\">Orientation to the Lab</a> \nsection of the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/LabManual/00-LabManual.html\">ICS 45J Lab Manual</a>.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pair Programming: </b>When working on some of the lab assignments, we have you use the &#147;pair programming&#148; approach. In pair programming, two programmers share one computer. One is the &#147;driver,&#148; who controls the keyboard and mouse. The other is the &#147;navigator,&#148; who observes, asks questions, suggests solutions, and thinks about slightly longer-term strategies. The two programmers switch roles about every 20 minutes. A pair of programmers, working as described here, nearly always beats the stereotypical solitary loner, producing more high-quality code in less than half the time (surprising, perhaps, but true). For some labs, we also have you work alone; being able to program solo is also an important skill.</p>\n\n<p>More about the lab assignments and pair programming are discussed in the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/LabManual/00-LabManual.html\">Lab Manual</a>.\n\n\n\n<hr>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Information\"></a>\n<h3>Important information</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Please keep this information at hand; it will likely be quite useful during the quarter!</p>\n\n<center><table border width=\"550\" >\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"43%\"><font class=\"normal\">Jacobson&#146;s office</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"57%\"><font class=\"normal\">Donald Bren Hall (DBH) 4052</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"43%\"><font class=\"normal\">Office hours</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"57%\"><font class=\"normal\">Mon. &amp; Wed. 3:30 - 4:45 pm, except on school holidays, and by appointment</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"43%\"><font class=\"normal\">Jacobson&#146;s phone</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"57%\"><font class=\"normal\">949-824-7300</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"43%\"><font class=\"normal\">Jacobson&#146;s email address</font></td>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"57%\"><font class= \"codeFaceSmall\">jacobson@uci.edu</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"43%\"><font class=\"normal\">Jacobson&#146;s home page:</font></td>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"57%\"><font class = \"codeFaceSmall\"> www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"43%\"><font class=\"normal\">Email address for questions about the course and required messages </font></td>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"57%\"><font class = \"codeFaceSmall\">ics45j@ics.uci.edu</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"43%\"><font class=\"normal\">ICS 45J WileyPlus Web page (where to find the on-line textbook) </font></td>\n<td valign= \"center\" width=\"57%\"><font class = \"codeFaceSmall\">http://edugen.wileyplus.com/edugen/domain/dmn54531/</font></td>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"43%\"><font class=\"normal\">Finding a Pair Programming Partner message board </font></td>\n<td valign= \"center\" width=\"57%\"><font class = \"codeFaceSmall\">https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/messageboard/m12963/</font></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><b><a href=\"http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/perl/WebSoc?YearTerm=2012-92&ShowFinals=1&ShowComments=1&Dept=I%26C%20SCI&CourseNum=45%2C80\">Click here for Lecture and Final Exam Times</a></b></p>\n\n<p><b><font class=\"normal\">Guest Account</font></b></p>\n<table border width=\"300\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"50%\"><font class=\"normal\">Login:</font></td>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"50%\"><font class=\"codeFaceSmall\">ics-temp</font></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"50%\"><font class=\"normal\">Password:</font></td>\n<td valign=\"center\" width=\"50%\"><font class=\"codeFaceSmall\">Anteat3r\n</font></td>\n</table>\n</center>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Accounts\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>UCInetID and ICS computer accounts</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>UCI provides all its students with basic computing,  including electronic mail and  \nInternet services, via a &#147;UCInetID&#148; computer account.

This book discusses introductory programming, and the basics, and some more advanced features of, Java. It is available in three forms: 1) as a paperback book, loose leaf or bound, and with or without an access code to the electronic version of the text, available from various bookstores and Websites, 2) as an &#147;electronic book&#148; from the publisher, Wiley Press, accessible via the Web, and 3) as an download file; you copy the text to your hard drive and read it using special software.</p>\n\n<p>The Web-based version of the text has sections that the printed copy does not, as well as animations, examples and other reference and tutorial material the printed book does not contain. I strongly urge you to obtain access to the electronic copy of the text (whether or not you obtain a hard-copy version) so that you have access to the web-only material. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><h4>Option 1: Getting a print version of the text</h4>\n\n<p>The bookstore has a new print copies of the book, loose leaf, with the code, for $94.60, and used copies (which may not have a still-valid code) for $70.95, both plus tax. For comparison, Amazon.com is selling the text, bound, for $86.16 (with free shipping) and in electronic book (Kindle) form for $77.54 (or as a Kindle rental starting at $42.71). You can also rent the text from Barnes &amp; Noble for $37.26 for 90 days, or buy it outright for $85.30 (with free shipping).</p>\n\n<p>A new book (loose leaf) is being offered by Wiley through a UCI-specific web site; from the page <a href=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-813476.html\">//www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-406856.html</a> you can purchase the book with an access code for $66.95 plus shipping (from $6.00 to $25.00, depending upon how fast you want the book) and tax.</p>\n\n<p> A new printed text with an access code costs more than the on-line text alone, but you get both a printed book and access to the online version of the text. If you buy a used print copy of the book, from any source, it does not matter whether you buy a version with the online access code: the code, even if present, will likely be invalid.</p>\n\n<li><h4>Option 2: Getting access to the electronic version of the text</h4>\n\n<p>To get access to the electronic version of the text, go to <a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-404743.html#computerscience\">the Computer Science section of the WileyPlus Courses website</a> and click on <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Horstmann / Big Java Fourth Edition AND Java Concepts Sixth Edition, <i>WileyPLUS</i> Registration Code</font>.

You may also find the tools within Microsoft Office useful. All these packages (and others) are available for your use on the machines in the Computer Labs. If you want to obtain any of this software for use on your own machine, please ask me for details. In brief, Office and SecureCRT must be licensed (for a fee), and Eclipse, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Sun&#146;s Java are free.</p>\n\n<p>You will also need a way to back up (make a copy) of your work.  You can use a USB memory stick or portable external hard drive, available in several capacities from many sources, including the UCI Computer store. You can store files to the so-called &#147;H drive&#148; of your ICS account; details of using the H drive are in the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/LabManual/02-OrientationToLab.html\">Orientation to the Lab</a> \nsection of the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/LabManual/00-LabManual.html\">ICS 45J Lab Manual</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"Grades\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Course assignments, exams, and their grading</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>The graded work in the course consists of</p>\n\n<p><i>Lab assignments: </i>The Lab Manual describes these assignments and their grading; 40% of the course grade</p>\n\n<p><i>One midterm:</i> 30% of the course grade</p>\n\n<p><i>One final exam:</i> 30% of the course grade</p>\n<p>The lab assignments have you design, implement (in Java) and test computer programs.</p>\n\n<p><b>Pair Programming:</b> You will work on some of the lab assignments using the pair programming approach discussed above. Pair programming almost always enables you to learn more about programming, and to complete the labs much more quickly, than working alone. I expect students to choose their partners. One good way to find a partner is to ask around at lecture;  another is to post a note on the course&#146;s <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/messageboard/m12963/\">Finding a Pair Programming Partner message board</a> on eee. If you cannot find a partner, let me know; I'll assist you in finding a partner. You or your partner must email the names of your team members to <font class=\"codeFaceSmall\">ics45j@ics.uci.edu</font> no later than the date given in the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/CourseSchedule.html\">Course Schedule</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Details about pair programming and choosing a partner are in the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/LabManual/02A-PairProgramming.html\">\nPair Programming</a> section of the Lab Manual.</p>\n<p>Lab assignment due dates are given in the\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/LabManual/00-LabContents.html\">Lab Grading section</a></font> of the Lab Manual; the midterm and final exam dates are given in the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/CourseSchedule.html\">Course Schedule</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Programming assignments always take longer to complete than you think they will (a phenomenon which occurs among professional computer scientists, not just students of computing.) Start each assignment no later than suggested, work diligently, ask questions, and plan for significant additional time outside class to complete your assignments, and you likely do well on them. Students who do not follow this advice typically do poorly.</p>\n\n<p>Your grades will be posted on UCI's <a href=\"http://eee.uci.edu\">Electronic Educational Environment (EEE)</a> web site. (If you have not previously used EEE to look up your grades, it&#146;s quite straight-forward. Just go to EEE, sign in to MyEEE, and follow the instructions for viewing course grades.) </p>\n\n<p><b>Exams:</b> To help you study for the exams, I've prepared a set of <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/SampleExamQuestions.pdf\">sample exam questions</a>. I'll happily discuss these questions (and their answers) after you have come up with your own answers. Most, if perhaps not quite all, of the topics covered in these question sets will appear on the midterm and final exams (and therei may beno questions on some topics that are on the actual exam; see; see the sample exam document for details).</p>\n\n<p>The midterm and final are multiple-choice exams. You will need to bring to the midterm and the final exam a Scantron answer sheet, Form No. 882-E or 2052 or equivalent (that is, a mark-sense form that is one-half of a regular sheet of paper cut lengthwise that has 50 questions on the front, with five possible responses for each question). Form 882-E is available at the UCI bookstore, among other locales.</p>\n\n<p>I keep your midterm and  final exam answer sheets, so that you can review them for any errors you think may be present, for a couple of years after the course is over, and typically recycle them after that time.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"CourseGrade\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Course Grade Calculation</h3>\n</div>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><i>We determine your weighted point total for the midterm and final exams</i>. </p>\n\n<li><p><i>We add in your pair programming evaluation score</i>. For each of the two evaluations of your programming partner (see the Lab Manual for details), we add 0, 1 or 2 points to your total points. You also receive one point, added to the total of your weighted point total, for turning in a complete pair programming evaluation on time (and no points for an incomplete evaluation, or for one turned in late or not at all).</p>\n\n<li><p><i>We deduct any pair programming adjustment</i>.  You may lose up to 2 points from your total if you did not fully participate in pair programming in Lab Assignments 1 to 3 as described in course documents and the relevant documents they reference. If there is not an adjustment, that is a good thing&#151;it means that we were notified, on time,  of your partnerships, that you worked in a pair (or otherwise, with the needed permission) and we have no evidence that you were a bad partner. (In the posted scores on eee, the appearance of \"--\" means there was no adjustment.) </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I'll be doing the grading. If you think an assignment or exam was graded incorrectly, contat me to discuss the matter. Please bring us your grading questions to me within a week after the assignment is returned, so we have sufficient time to resolve the matter. In any event, you must contact me before the final; UCI rules prohibit regrading of work once the class ends.</p>\n\n<p>&#9;I'll assign final grades on <i>at least</i> the following scale; if the exams turn out to be significantly more difficult than expected, the cutoffs may be lower: Grades in the A range (A&#150;, A, and in exceptional cases, A+), 80% and above; grades in the B range, 70%&#150;69%; grades in the C range, 60%&#150;59%; grades in the D range, 50%&#150;49%; and F grades below that. Using an established point scale means that you are not graded in direct competition with your classmates. Many courses set cut points at 90% for an A, 80% for a B, and so on; these lower cut points reflect the difficulty of this course's exams.</p>\n\n<p>Final course grades, the scores used to compute them, a number of statistics about the class, a discussion of how grades were computed, and related matters, will be available on the course Web page soon after the course is over. Follow the links to <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/CourseGrades.html\">Course Grades</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics45J/NoteOnGrades.html\">A Note on Course Grades</a> to access that information.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Cooperation\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>About cooperation and using other people's work</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>ICS 23 students are expected to know and follow UCI and Bren School academic honesty\npolicies; do read them. The ICS policy can be found  (among other places) on the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php?policy=cheating\">ICS undergraduate student policies</a> Web page; the UCI policy is on the <a href=\"http://www.senate.uci.edu/senateweb/default2.asp?active_page_id=754\">UCI Academic Senate site</a>.\n\n<p>In addition to those rules, there are some specific rules regarding student-with-student cooperation in this class:\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>You may cooperate on the sample exam question sets to any degree you wish, as well as make use of course staff and other resources. </p></li>\n\n<li><p>On programming assignments, the work you turn in must be your own, if it is a solo assignment, or yours and your progamming partner's work, if it is pair programming assignment. You may not do joint work other than with your programming partner. In particular, you also not have another person write part of your program or let someone plan the detailed strategy you will use to attack the problem, with the exception of your programming partner on pair programming assignments. You may ask other students for help on technical matters, such as how to use Java or interpret a Java error message. You may, of course, get help from me:feel free to ask me any question you have (but I may decline to answer it if it means I will be doing your work for you). You may also use data and programs we provide to you. </p></li>\n\n<li><p>You may not copy code from any textbook&#151;including the text for this course&#151;or any other source unless you have specific permission from me, or when a lab assignment specifically allows you to do so. When you are allowed to adapt code from another source for use in your program code, you must credit the source of that code in your program&#146;s comments and any related write-ups. </p></li>\n\n<li><p><i>Note that we compare submitted lab work to other work done this quarter and done in previous quarters</i>, and will consider it strong evidence of academic dishonesty if any assignments are inappropriately similar. </p>\n\n<p>More detail about appropriate code reuse is given in the Lab Manual.</p>\n\n<li><p>On exams, you must do your own work: Using answers from another source, such as a student sitting near you at the exam, is a particularly serious infraction of academic honesty rules.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If you are unsure whether certain behavior is acceptable, ask before you engage in it.</p>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Acknowledgement.</b> Thanks to Prof. David G.
