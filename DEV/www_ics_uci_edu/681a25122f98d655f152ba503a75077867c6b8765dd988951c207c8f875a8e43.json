Both the Russians and the Confederates considered\nthe Jews as enemies from the start.  Without mercy they hung Jews on\nbranches of trees.  Both sides demanded heavy deliveries of bread and\nmeat, quartering of soldiers and also armed help and espionage service.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Even before this confederacy, i.e. during the time\nof the Radom Confederacy and before the time that the Warsaw Sejm,\nupon the order of Repnin, had decided to give equal rights to the\ndissenters, the followers of the old order attempted to prevent this\nthrough various means.  Priests denounced equal rights from their\npulpits as the act of the devil and attempted through defamatory\npamphlets to undermine Repnin's aims.  One such satire is the\n\"Manifesto of the Confederated Israelite Nobility,\nof the Foreign Nations, of the Former Inhabitants of Jerusalem.\"\nIt was distributed by special messengers among various cities and was\nalso copied from hand to hand.  In this manifesto, the Jews supposedly\ncomplain that while the rights of nobility and equal rights are being\ngiven to Lutherans and Orthodox, they, the ancient Jerusalem nobility,\nolder than any other, are omitted.  In order to provide a semblance of\nveracity to this complaint, the author depicts the Jews as complaining\nof their unhappy condition and the way in which they are despised by\nvarious circles among the people.  \"No one has respect for us,\" they\nsay.  \"On the contrary, only too frequently does each one of us have\na stone from a Christian lad fly by our head.\" The pamphlet is set in\nthe chancery style of the Polish documents of the Jewish councils, even\nthough the Councils of the Lands had ceased to exist since 1764. . . .</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This pamphlet was only a political anecdote.  Following\nit came the tragic reality--the Confederacy of Bar.  Immediately after\nit was started in Bar the news reached Cracow.  Specially manufactured\nnewspapers, dated Warsaw, were distributed throughout the city.  Residents\nread with gusto \"of the victories of the Confederates over the Russians,\nof the triumphs of Pulawski over Padgorichanin, Kretchnikov and\nApraksin\" and readily believed them.\nThey inwardly suppressed their enmity to their age-old enemies and their\nallies on the Polish throne.  In time the nobility of the Cracow region\nwas divided into supporters and opponents of the Confederation and they\nbattled with each other in the Proszow Sejmik.  The townspeople and the\nJews stood in between and awaited whatever time and the future would\nbring.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Soon the report came to the Cracow Town Hall that\nthe Confederates were routed and that Bar and Berdichev were captured.\nTo the Jewish town hall in Kazimierz came the report of the slaughter\nat Urnan, in which almost all the Jews of the town were killed. There\nwas not too much time to meditate on these happenings.  On June 20,\n1768 the wojewodztwo of the Confederation of Cracow was organized and\nit selected as marshall the well-known play-boy and profilgate, Michal\nCzarnocki, the owner of Secymin.  The very next day the Confederates\ntook over the Cracow garrison.  The town administration thereupon swore\nallegiance, without hesitation, to Czarnocki.  Only the town-mayor,\nPiotr Szaster, laid down his post.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">These formalities were hardly completed when Russian\ntroops appeared outside the city and shooting began at the Slawkowska\ngate.  In order to protect the city from sudden attack Czarnocki ordered\nthe city gates to be closed during the day and he introduced special\npasses for those who had business outside the city gates.  This immediately\naffected the Jews, who lived in Kazimierz but had their stores and\nwarehouses in Cracow.  Only a few succeeded in securing passes.  The\ngreat majority could not get into Cracow and the Jewish shops, therefore,\nremained closed for a long period.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Meanwhile the Russians, under Apraksin and Prozorovski,\nencircled the city with an increasingly tight cordon.  They cut off\nthe supply of food and captured the small groups of Confederates who\nhad rushed to the aid of their comrades.  Nevertheless the siege lasted\nfor eight weeks.  The orders of Repnin, intended to hasten the end\nof the war, were of no avail.  He advised the use of spies and Jews.\nIn order to force the Jews into submission he suggested that they be\nthreatened with exile deep into Russia or hanging upon the first suitable\nbranch.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Soon hunger began to be felt in Cracow. The burghers\ndemanded that the city surrender.  The Confederates, losing more and\nmore every day, attributed all their defeats to treason and searched\nfor spies everywhere.  Several \"spies\" were hung in the market place,\namong them also Jews.  Among those hung was Ciszek, the officer of\nthe town garrison, who was accused of being in contact with the Russians.\nThe go-between was alleged to be Isaac of Kazimierz, a Jew from Sacz,\n\"who used to meet with a Cossack officer in the Kazimierz synagogue.\"\nThis allegation was reported by a memoir writer of the time and has\nbeen repeated uncritically by all subsequent historians who did not\nstop to reflect that in July 1768, Kazimierz was still in the hands\nof the Confederates.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">When Czarnocki saw that he would not be able to hold\nCracow, he ordered the Jews to supply 600 men.  Weeping, they told\nhim that there were altogether only 1,500 souls in the empty Jewish\ncity and he ordered them to pay 80,000 zlotys within a week.  The Jews\nbegan to bargain with him and he became impatient.  He ordered the\nparnes of the community (Fayvush Giesser) to be seized, and his head,\nbeard and ear-locks to be shaved.  He threatened to do the same to\nothers if one penny were missing from the sum he set.  The Jews temporarily\npaid several thousand zlotys; they were relieved of paying the rest\nby the Russians, who captured Kazimierz and the Jewish quarter on August\n1, 1768.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Russians used Kazimierz as operations base to\nstorm Cracow during the following two weeks.  During this period they\nused Jews to build trenches and bury their dead.  They also quartered\ntheir soldiers in Jewish homes.  On August 17, the Russians entered\nCracow.  After they had driven the Confederates deep into Russia, they\nmade themselves comfortable in the city.  They imposed heavy tribute\nupon the population and threatened hanging for the slightest provocation.\nDrevich carried on more wildly than any other.  He would continue to\ndispatch contingents of troops to capture the fortresses in the neighborhood,\nTyniec, Lanckorona and Czestochowa. The permanent Cracow commandant,\nLobry, was more humane.  The townspeople became intimate with him and\nJews also had access to him.  They served as purveyors for him and\nsought his help in their struggle with their own co-religionists for\ncontrol of the community.  The rich Cracow Jew, Israel Aronovich, purveyor\nof the mint, became a factor for Lobry.  He \"loaned\" huge sums to Lobry\nas well as to the later commandants, and these \"loans\" were at the\nexpense of the Cracow Jewish community.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Russians remained in Cracow a whole year.  On\nSeptember 3, they liquidated their command and left the city in order\nto storm Czgstochowa, the strongest fortress of the Confederates.\nBefore they retired they ordered the Jews to pay 7,000 zlotys for the\nsupplies they were leaving behind in the Wawel warehouse.  These supplies\nhad been delivered by Jewish purveyors who had not been paid for them.\nNow the Jewish community had to pay the required sum and the supplies\nthereupon were taken over by the Confederates who occupied Cracow on\nSeptember 13.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">A new series of requisitions and forced deliveries\nof goods, grain and wood now began.  Marshal Dzierzanowski had captured\nthe Wieliczka mines without a shot and he imposed upon the merchants,\ncraft guilds, clergy and Jews the obligation to buy 1,000 barrels of\nsalt at a very high price.  On the very first day he extracted 18,000\nzlotys from various individuals.  Others paid for the salt later.\nIn return, however, they only received paper money, which lost its\nvalue when the Confederates again abandoned Cracow.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">On November 9, 1769, the Confederates abandoned the\ncity.  The Russians returned and remained there until June, 1772, when\nthe first partition of Poland took place.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">For two full years the impoverished and sacked city\nhad to support the Muscovite troops, who continued to carry out attacks\nin various directions.  At the same time the inhabitants also suffered\nfrom diversionary attacks made from time to time by the Confederates.\nThus on November 26, 1769, the hussars of Trzebinski and Paszkowski\nattacked the Jewish quarter.  The Russian soldiers were then in the\nJewish bathhouse.  Many were hacked to death and others taken away\nas prisoners.  The Jews, because they had \"taken care of\" the Russians,\npaid for it with the plundering of their shops and warehouses. Such\nattacks were repeated many times during the course of the winter of\n1769-70, as on January 17, 1770, March 1, and March 4. On each occasion\nthe Confederates plundered the Jews or took them as prisoners.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">&#9;The summer of 1770 was relatively calm.  But\nthe diversions and attacks were renewed in the winter of 1770-71.\nOn January 13, the Confederates attacked Kazimierz, managed to reach\nthe house of the commandant, Major Orszakow, killed some of his men\nand took others prisoner.  Then they attacked Cracow.  They were not\nsuccessful and therefore also abandoned Kazimierz.  They thereupon\nplundered the Jewish homes and dealt with the Jews in \"so godless a\nmanner\" that it seemed incredible to the correspondent of the <I>Hildesheimer</I>\n<I>Relationskurrier. </I>The same correspondent estimated the Jewish\ndamage of that day at 300,000 zlotys.  Even though this sum is obviously\nexaggerated it does testify to the great damage suffered by the Jews.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">A few days later Paszkowski's and Schutz's divisions\nrepeated the attack on Kazimierz.  They caught many Jews and dragged\nthem off.  Many of them were hung on the way.  Twelve others, among\nthem the <I>parnes, </I>Gutman Rakowski, were incarcerated in Lanckorona\nand Wieliczka and 12,000 zlotys were demanded as ransom money.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Rakowski could not endure the beating he was\nsubjected to upon his arrest on the way.  When he felt he was dying\nhe called Israel Davidovich and Levi Jakhimovich and dictated his will\nin their presence.  From this we learn of the sufferings he endured\nin prison, how his home in the Jewish quarter was destroyed, papers\nworth more than 2,000 zlotys torn up, and how, \"by whips\" they extracted\nfrom him the bit of cash he had taken with him on the road.  Rakowski\ndied in Lanckorona on June 18, 1771.  When his wife learned of the\ndeath of her husband she gathered together her last pennies and, at\ngreat risk, came to Lanckorona in order to redeem his body. The Confederates,\nhowever, refused to lower the price they had previously set.  They\nreleased only several of the Jews and kept the others in prison.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">It is also very interesting that during this time\nthere was a Jew who, instead of helping his brothers, sought to make\na fortune out of the Jewish tragedy.  This was Nakhman of Kalwarja,\nthe factor of Korytowski and purveyor to Prince Czartoryski.  The families\nof the captured Jews addressed a request to him that he intervene with\nthe Confederates in their behalf.  Through him, too, they sent food\nand money for their unfortunate relatives.  Nakhman mercilessly took\nthe money for himself and in addition he persuaded Korytowski to increase\nthe rental fee for his \"grey house\" in Cracow, notwithstanding the\nexplicit prohibition by the Prince.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The last heroic act of the Confederates was the\ncapture of the Wawel Castle.  Here they remained several months.\nDuring this period one of their divisions again plundered the Jewish\nquarter and dragged off a number of Jews as prisoners.  These were\nkept for several months in the Wieliczka prison in hunger and cold.\nA Jew, Aron Wielitchker, who allied himself with the Confederates,\nhelped make their lot worse.  On May 5, 1772, at-the end of the Confederate\nperiod, the Cracow Jewish community excommunicated Nakhman.  But the\nunfortunate prisoners continued to be held.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">At this time the partition treaty of the three great\npowers had already been signed.  The foreign troops pecked, at the\nliving body of the Polish state like birds of prey.  Because of\nthe vague formulation of the treaty, the Austrians took over Kazimierz\nand with it the Jewish quarter, while the Poles retained Cracow.  The\nJews of Cracow suddenly became subjects of Her Royal Majesty, Maria\nTheresa.  They submitted to their new rulers a list of the damages\nthey had suffered at the hands of the Russians and the Confederates.\nJewish individuals suffered damages to the amount of 288,131 zlotys.\nThe community, according to the oath of the <I>parnosim, </I>also had\nincurred expenses . . . . These they estimated at 130,000 zlotys.\nTogether the sum amounted to 418,131 zlotys.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This was the flag under which the history of Cracow\nJews proceeded in those days of plagues, when every month, if not every\nday, brought with it new restrictive orders and troubles, and when\nthe Jewish quarter was a battlefield commanded now by the Russians,\nnow by the Confederates.  Not one house in the city emerged intact.\nMost of the stores were plundered and the community itself, including\nits <I>parnosim, </I>was oppressed and disgraced.  These <I>parnosim\n</I>and their syndics lived as on a volcano.  Every minute they were\ncalled or dragged to another officer.  To each one they had to bow\ntheir heads, appease him and stuff him with gold unless they wanted\nto be hung on the first good branch of a tree or be hacked to death\nin the gateway of their own house.  It is, therefore, no wonder that\nthe <I>parnosim </I>took money from whatever source they could.  They\nwould extort some from members of the community; some they would borrow\nat exorbitant rates of interest, often up to 40 percent.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">During the early period of the Confederacy of Bar,\nthe following <I>parnosim </I>stood at the head of the community without\ninterruption and without elections: Fayvush Giesser, Gutman Rakowski,\nDr. Mendl Kalahora, all allied with the well-known Jekeles family.\nThis family was represented in the council of the community by the\nold Moyshe Jekeles, who was looked upon as the head of the community.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Jekeles family and their allies ruled over the\nCracow community for over 150 years.  Jewish families declined and\nnew ones rose to power, Jews became rich and Jews became poor, but\nthe Jekeles family continued to hold communal power.  They had to endure\nmore than one battle to maintain their control which they looked upon\nas a hereditary power.  The fortune of the family came to be divided\nup.  There were rich members of the family and poor ones.  Our Moyshe\nwas of the poor ones.  Notwithstanding his modest fortune and his old\nage, which made him bent and hunch-backed, he possessed a firm spirit\nand the pride of an aristocrat and he stood up courageously against\nthe machinations of his opponents.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Gutman Rakowski occupied the leading place in the\nJekeles faction.  Rakowski's grandfather had occupied a communal post.\nIn 1745 his father, Berl Rakowski, was among the <I>tuvim </I>and he\nhimself became that year one of the community councilors (<I>mezy</I>\nor <I>dziewiecmezy). </I>During the years 1756-61, in the struggle\nbetween the Jewish and non-Jewish merchants, Berl was also one of the\n<I>tuvim </I>and all his goods were confiscated at that time. This\naffected him so deeply that he became ill and soon died.  His son Gutman\ntook over his business as well as his debts.  It was this Gutman\nwho died in Lanckorona as a prisoner of the Confederates.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Dr. Mendl Kalahora came from a well-known Sephardic\nfamily. His father, Dr. Aron Kalahora, was the first Jew to receive\na diploma from the Cracow Academy.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush Giesser was a new figure in Cracow.  He came\nfrom Zolkiew.  He married in Cracow and thanks to his family connections\nsoon became <I>parnes.  </I>In 1767 we find him in this post together\nwith Hershl Stobnitzki, one of the most powerful of the Cracow Jews.\nThese two had attempted to smooth over the trouble between the arrendator\nof liquor taxes, Leizer Melekhiovich, and the trustee of <I>the hekdesh,\ni.e. </I>the head of the charity committee, Jonah Rabinovich.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The incident was trivial but it created a great stir.\nMelekhovich was arrendator of liquor taxes and he prevented the Jews\nfrom selling liquor in their taverns.  That is why he was hated in\nthe towns.  Because he feared revenge, Leizer induced the provincial\ngovernment to take him out of the jurisdiction of the Jewish community\ncourt and to provide him with a letter of protection.  The community\nwanted to play a prank on him in return and it permitted one of its\nmembers, Jonah Rabinovich, to rent Leizer's pew in the old synagogue.\nLeizer became infuriated at the community and went to the officer of\nthe Kazimierz garrison, Antoni Eismond, who brought back to Jonah the\nmoney he paid for Leizer's pew.  Jonah, in turn, turned the money over\nto the trustees of the <I>hekdesh </I>(the pew belonged to them) and\nthen Eismond, with military escort, came to the meeting of the trustees,\nread them the letter of the wojewoda and demanded to know if they were\nready to obey the commands of the wojewoda and respect the protective\ndocuments he issued.  The trustees were not overawed by the officer's\nthreats and immediately turned the case over to the Jewish court.\nThe latter excommunicated Leizer and ordered him jailed.  The sextons\ntook Leizer to the jail next to the synagogue while Eismond's soldiers\ntook Jonah Rabinovich into custody and put him into the wojewoda\njail, <I>i.e. </I>in the local prison.  Fayvush Giesser, <I>parnes\n</I>of the community, saw the danger in the situation and intervened.\nHe invited Eismond to the home of the rabbi, where Hershl Stobnitzki\nand Dr. Kalahara were already waiting.  Unexpectedly Jonah arrived\ntoo.  He had gotten out of jail.  He punched Eismond in the nose several\ntimes.  The latter fainted and was revived by the rabbi's wife.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The whole affair was so strange that it came to the\nwojewoda court.  After listening to testimony, the court decreed that\nJonah Rabinovich was to be imprisoned for six months and was not to\noccupy any public post for six years.  Hershl Stobnitzki was sentenced\nto two weeks in prison and was barred from public office for three\nyears.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Jonah was so broken up by this sentence that he never\nagain served as a <I>parnes.  </I>Stobnitzki emerged again a few years\nlater.  Both, however, could not be selected at the next communal election\nand they were replaced by (in addition to Kalahora and Giesser) Rakowski,\nIsrael Aronovich and, as usual, by one of the Jekeles family-- Moyshe\nJekeles.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Even before the arrival of the Confederates these\n<I>parnosim </I>had had great difficulties in collecting taxes and\nin covering the communal debts that had reached astronomical proportions.\nWhen the Confederates arrived, pillaging and hanging again set in.\nSoon the Russians came and Capt. Lobry assumed command of the Cracow\ngarrison.  Aronovich, also known as Menashe's, became an intimate of\nhis.  He was made a purveyor for the Russian army and came to have\na powerful influence in the Jewish community and even in the city of\nCracow.  Israel, it is true, used his influence for the benefit of\nthe Jewish population but he did not mind spending communal money in\norder to satisfy the military.  He made loans at high interest rates\nand imposed increasingly high consumers taxes which poisoned the life\nof the already impoverished Cracow Jewry.  By these methods Israel\nmanaged to win over Lobry to his side and also his successors, Oebelschwitz\nand Stahremberg, and, together with his four friends, automatically\noccupied the posts of <I>parnosim </I>for four continuous years, without\nrendering account to anyone over this long period.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Against \"Jekeles' five\" and his plunder-economy,\nprotests came from the Stobnitzkis (officially the father, Moyshe,\nand behind the scenes, his son Hersh), Shimen Bass, Moyshe Braciejowski\nand later the purveyor of the Warsaw mint, Fayvush Abrahamovich, who,\nthanks to his position, was relieved of payments and had the right\nto buy up silver coins throughout the country.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush Abrahamovich came from Przedborz and was\napparently a relative or in-law of the famous Landau family.  Around\n1750 he came to Cracow and there married the daughter of a rich\nJew, Avigdor ben Moyshe Gumprecht.   Avigdor had been a <I>parnes\n</I>for several years but he had a bad reputation.  His father had\nalso been a <I>parnes </I>in the second decade of the 18th century,\nbut he was unable to give proper accounting of -the public funds and\nhe landed in the wojewoda prison in 1728.  In order to secure his release,\nhe extorted from the community secretary, Joshua Horowitz, a\nwritten declaration that he had returned to him all accounts and receipts\nas well as the 400 zlotys cash which he had been accused of appropriating.\nHorowitz gave Moyshe such a declaration but on March 21, 1728, he withdrew\nit in the presence of the syndic and vice-syndic and had his withdrawal\nrecorded in the wojewoda books.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Avigdor was no better than his father.  But a more\ninteresting type was his son-in-law, Fayvush Abrahamovich.  He won\nthe sympathy of the opposition elements in the community.  The enemies\nof the Jekeles faction authorized him to induce the Russian authorities\nto set the drawing of lots for the intermediate days of Passover.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Faysush began with a clever trick.  He took advantage\nof the fact\nthat Moyshe Jekeles was old, that Israel Aronovich was away on business\nto Warsaw and that others were absent from the city or were imprisoned\nby the Confederates so that only Dr. Mendl Kalahora could come to the\ncommunity house, and called together a meeting of some fifty Jews of\nthe town on February 2, 1772.  They passed the following resolution:</P>\n<DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">In view of the fact of the oppression and the sad\nstate of the community of Kazimierz near Cracow ... because of the\ntimes of plagues, because of all kinds of armies everywhere . . . and\njust because of this we endure suffering every minute and every hour\nthat cannot be recorded on paper, and especially because our city has\nbecome empty, and we can no longer bear the burdens, and there is no\nhelp or support to come from anywhere--we therefore have, with God's\nhelp, decided not to allow that the Jews be scattered from the city\nand we have decided to select several people to complete the number\nof <I>roshim </I>[heads] missing on the <I>kahal board:</I> inspectors\nof accounts <I>(roei heshbonot), hekdesh </I>trustees, and nine <I>kahal\n</I>men. These newly selected men must be ready at any moment to help\nthe <I>tuvim </I>[optimates], control the schedule of duties and take\nmeasures to collect them.</P></DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">It seems likely that the opposition was more interested\nin control than in aid.  But the incumbent <I>parnosim </I>did not\nwant to agree to this and luck was with them; the very same day the\nConfederates captured the Wawel Castle, shooting began and there was\nno opportunity for discussion.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayrush Abrahamovich did not give up.  Thirsting\nfor revenge against the Jekeles faction, he paid no attention to personal\ndangers nor to material damages and he determined to crush all obstacles\nin order to carry through new elections and secure the <I>kahal</I>\nmandates for himself and for his supporters.  Since Rzewuski, the Cracow\nwojewoda, was a prisoner of the Russians, it was necessary to appeal\nto the highest authorities in Warsaw to get permission to carry through\nthe elections.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush, therefore, went to Warsaw.  He succeeded\nin winning over the chancellor, Father Mlodziejowski, and the latter\ninvited the Russian General Waynmarn and several staff-officers to\ndinner several times in order to get them to permit the elections for\nthe Cracow <I>kahal. </I>Waynmarn issued the appropriate order to the\nCracow commandant Oebelschwitz, and the latter immediately gave his\nconsent to issue such a permit.  He only expressed his \"unofficial\nopinion that the new <I>kahal </I>council would be adapted to the demands\nof the Russian army both in respect to loyalty and in respect to supplies,\ntransport, spies and the like\"</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">In order to assure the commandant of his loyalty,\nFayvush gave him, as he later testified, 500 zlotys.  Before he received\nthe rescript for the elections, however, Oebelschwitz left his post\nand was succeeded by Capt.  Stahremberg. Stahremberg also adhered to\nthe view of his predecessor regarding \"the benefits which the Russian\ncommand had derived from the old <I>kahal\" </I>and had planned to make\nsuch a report to his superiors.  But Fayvush anticipated this and sent\nhim a present (certainly not out of his own pocket.) of 200 ducats.\nIn his notes on this, Fayvush added the interesting comment that \"Stahremberg\nhad yielded only after much pleading and importuning . . . But [when\nhe took the 200 ducats] he had done him a great favor, because he could\nhave, had he wanted, taken three times as much from the old <I>parnosim.\"</P>\n</I><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Armed with Stahremberg's permit, Fayvush now\nplayed the role of a formalist and decided to carry out the drawing\nof lots, in accordance with law, with the assistance of the Jewish\njudge.  The Jewish judge, Kurdwanowski, a well-known adherent of the\nConfederates, lived in hiding outside Cracow.  Fayvush turned to Sebastjan\nBadeni, the judge of the Cracow castle and inspector of the mint, to\nget him into the Jewish quarter in Kazimierz and to intervene with\nthe commandant of the city.  Badeni undertook the mission for the price\nof 100 ducats. He invited Stahremberg to lunch and secured from him\na safe-conduct for a short term. Protected by such a safe-conduct,\nthe Jewish judge arrived in Kazimierz.  He collected 100 ducats, however,\nfor his expenses and labors.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">New elections were now held for the <I>kahal.  </I>The\nold council was deposed and Fayvush Abrahamovich, Hershl Stobnitzki\nand their supporters were elected as the new <I>parnosim. </I>As soon\nas it was constituted, the new <I>kahal </I>carried out an examination\nof the accounts of the preceding four years.  At the same time it issued\nan announcement calling upon all who had any information to declare\non oath in what ways they had been wronged by Israel Aronovich and\nhis friends.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">In order to annoy him further, Fayvush had Israel\nput into the pillory in the old synagogue and then he issued a very\nsevere sentence upon him which was pronounced in the same synagogue\nwith black candles and with the call of the shofar.  While listening\nto the verdict, Israel stood bound in heavy chains and his pew in the\nsynagogue was draped in black as for one who had died.  After the ceremony\nIsrael was paraded through the city to the jail.  When his mother,\nan old lady of 70, tried to approach him, Fayvush pushed her away with\nsuch force that she fell to the earth and fainted.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Israel remained in prison for several weeks.  Only\nwhen his wife brought Fayvush cash and securities valued at 300 ducats\nwas he released and he had to swear that he would not seek satisfaction\nin the state courts.  At the same time he signed a declaration that\nhe had given Fayrush the 300 ducats of his own good will and without\npressure.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">No sooner had Israel left the walls of the jail than\nhe proceeded immediately to Cracow, dispatched a thundering protest\nto the regional court and hired horses to go to Warsaw to seek the\naid of his protectors.  Fayvush heard of all this immediately and he\nordered Israel's wife to summon her husband to the Jewish quarter.\nWhen she refused he ordered Israel to be excommunicated the following\nSabbath and had the ban proclaimed in six synagogues.  To wreak his\nvengeance still further he had Israel's wife roused out of bed and,\nwith an escort of 15 night-watchmen carrying lanterns, taken to the\nold synagogue to hear the excommunication proclaimed against her husband.\nFayvush also vented his rage on Israel's daughter; he took away from\nher fiance the securities which her father had deposited for her dowry.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Israel knew of all that was going on.  His good friends\ninformed him how Fayvush was maltreating his wife and daughter and\ninsulting him and his near ones.  He therefore spared no money or energy\nto gain access to the occupying powers.  With the aid of friends among\nthe nobility he secured an order to Stahremberg from the Russian General\nBibikov that the investigation of the quarrel between the former and\npresent <I>parnosim </I>of the <I>kahal </I>be reopened.  Bibikov also\nordered that two ranking Russian officers participate in the investigation.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush Abrahamovich was afraid of the reopening\nof the investigation, especially since he did not know how the Russian\nofficers would behave.  Through the intervention of Badeni, he secured\npermission to have two Polish officers at the hearing of testimony.\nThe commission thus included Major Artzybashev and a captain (name\nunknown) from the Russian side; the Jewish judge, Kurdwanowski, and\nthe sub-delegate from Cracow, Krowicki, for the Polish side.  Fayvush\nbribed them all.  He even sent gifts to the investigators and the secretaries.\nHe derived little benefit from it, however.  Major Artzybashev sent\nthe record of the proceedings to Stahremberg and the latter sent it\nimmediately to General von Roenne at Lublin.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">No one in Cracow knew who was in charge of civil\naffairs in the Russian command in Lublin.  Fayvush, therefore, sent\na special messenger to secure this information.  It turned out that\nthe civil commissioner was Major Hoshan, Lobry's former aide, and a\ngood friend of Fayvush.  Fayvush despatched 200 ducats to win him over\nto his side.  Without even reading the records, Hoshan returned them\nto Cracow with an order to Stahremberg that he deal with the matter\nhimself.  Stahrenberg turned the dossier over to the reporter, Piotr\nSzaster, the former mayor of Cracow and now an official in the commandatura.\nSzaster examined the whole case, recognized Fayvush's guilt and ordered\nhim to pay 200 ducats to Israel and 100 to the Jewish community.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Fayvush was not successful this time in making an\nappeal.  He was immediately taken into custody and forced to pay the\nabove-mentioned sums. He was detained even after payment until further\nword came from higher channels, first from Moscow, then from Prussia,\nand finally from Austria.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Just at this time the Russians left Cracow and Kazimierz\nand turned the cities over to the Prussians.  The latter also left\nsoon and on June 11, 1772, both cities were occupied by Austrian troops.\nLater the Austrians left Cracow but retained Kazimierz, which is on\nthe right bank of the Vistula.  General D'Alton set up his command\nheadquarters first in Wieliczka, later in Tarnow.  Only the district\noffice was left in Wieliczka and the commanding officer there was Joseph\nvon Baum.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The members of the former <I>kahal </I>quickly oriented\nthemselves to the situation.  Taking advantage of the fact that Fayvush\nwas still in jail, they sent Israel to Wieliczka to sound out the new\nrulers.  Israel was able to reach D'Alton and he gave him his version\nof the whole matter.  D'Alton, not having the slightest notion of what\nhad been going on in the city for years, immediately dispatched his\nlieutenant-auditor, Mansack, to Cracow and gave him Dobrowolski as\naide.  The latter soon became the Jewish judge for the Austrians.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Mansack treated Fayvush as a criminal.  He was kept\nin jail, and sent to court and to the investigating magistrate under\nguard.  The gifts which Fayvusli sent to both officials were of no\navail.  Mansack assembled all the Jews in the synagogue, ordered the\nold <I>kahal de</I>posed and a new one elected.  The new one consisted\nfor the most part of the Jekeles faction.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Finally, Fayvush got out of jail.  He immediately\ncharged Mansack with taking bribes and bringing harm to the Austrian\nauthority.  D'Alton had Mansack arrested but he took no action\non the matter itself but transferred it to Lemberg.  To Lemberg, therefore,\nwent Avigdor, the father-in-law of Fayvush and he succeeded in having\nthe matter directed \"temporarily\" to Wieliczka for further investigation.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">In the meantime Shloyme Rabinovich, son-in-law of\nMoyshe Jekeles, delivered to Emperor Joseph <I>ein alluntertanigstes\nImmediatgesuch, </I>in which he described in detail the \"robberies\nand bribes\" of the incumbent <I>kahal </I>elders.  Joseph II turned\nover the request to the Lemberg authorities and the governor appointed\na commission to investigate the charges.</P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This was the beginning of Austrian rule in Kazimierz.</P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">During this terrible period, a time of civil war\nand of conflicts between Jewish factions, the fight also continued\nbetween the Jews and the Kazimierz magistrates concerning the right\nto trade in the Jewish town and also with the Cracow magistrates concerning\ntrade and work in Cracow.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The constitution of 1768 had declared that in those\ncities where there were no agreements with the Jews, commercial agreements\nbe made with them.  It did not indicate, however, who was to take the\ninitiative, what sort of agreements they were to be and what was to\nbe done if the authorities did not want to make such an agreement.\nThe matter was given some attention in Cracow and in Kazimierz but\nno progress was made because just at that time, in 1768, Cracow was\noccupied first by the Confederates and then by the Russians.  When\nthe Russian occupation continued on, however, and the Jews in Cracow\nonce again opened their shops and warehouses and some of them did quite\nwell with military supplies, the municipal authorities remembered their\nold headache and once again entered charges against the Jews in the\nAssessor's Court in Warsaw.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">On June 30, 1769, the trial opened.  The municipal\nauthorities were represented by Jan Nepomucen Slominski, the Jewish\ncommunity by Antoni Opelewski.  The court postponed the case because\nboth sides had failed to present their documents in time.  The case\nwas resumed over a year later, on November 7, 1770.  This time the\nmunicipality was represented by Pawel Bialobrzeski and the Jews again\nby Opelewski.  Opelewski proposed the agreement of 1609, which Wladyslaw\nIV had confirmed in 1630 and which stipulated that in case of conflict\nthe Jews were to come not under the jurisdiction of the Assessors Court\nbut under that of the wojewoda.  Bialobrzeski appealed to the constitution\nof 1764 and claimed that the Assessors Court was competent to try the\ncase.  The court agreed with the conclusions of the lawyer for the\nJews and sent the case to the Cracow wojewoda with the comment that\nhe should see to it that the litigants arrange a commercial agreement\nbetween them, with the right of appeal to the Assessor's Court.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Unfortunately for the Jews, the Cracow wojewoda,\nRzewuski, was a prisoner of the Russians and the Jewish judge Kurdwanowski,\na supporter of the Confederates, was in hiding in the suburbs of the\ncity. There was no authority, therefore, that could take the case in\nhand and the officials took advantage of this and began, on their own,\nto shut down Jewish shops and to confiscate the goods.  The Jews thereupon\nhastened to Commandant Oebelschwitz and he, in turn, sent a letter\nto his superior, General Waynmarn in Warsaw, inquiring what he should\ndo in the matter.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Waynmarn forbade the Cracow commandant to interfere\nin a matter which was not his concern. Meanwhile the municipal officials\nwere able to secure from King Stanislaw August (December 8, 1770) a\nconfirmation of the decree of 1750 of August III, which forbade the\nJews from carrying on trade in Cracow.  The city officials immediately\ncalled the Jewish elders to the Town Hall, read the decree to them\nand ordered them immediately to close up their shops and cease their\ntrade. On December 17, 1770, the Jews entered a protest and on December\n29, they submitted a memorandum that the city officials had again begun\nto confiscate Jewish property as in the years 1742-1761. The city officials\npaid scant attention to the protests and on January 3, 1771, they publicly\nproclaimed the royal decree and continued to confiscate Jewish goods,\nalthough a bit more cautiously.  They were cautious because they did\nnot know how the occupying power would view the matter and Waynmarn's\ninstructions to Oebelschwitz were not known in the city. There was\na series of protests and counter protests until the matter came back\nto the Assessor's Court.  The Christian party sought to hasten the\ntrial, the Jews to delay it.  The Russian army in Kazimierz was forcing\nthe Jews to repair the city and at the same time the Jews could not\ngain access to their archives and get the needed documents.  The Jewish\n<I>parnosim </I>could not leave the city to go to intervene in Warsaw.\nThey had to stand guard over their person and property.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Jewish community appealed on February 26, 1771\nto the chancellor, Father Mlodziejowski, and he intervened by asking\nthe Cracow magistrate to conclude \"any sort of peace\" with the Jews.\nThe Jews also addressed themselves to the town-president \"that, out\nof respect for the letter of protection of the chancellor he should\nbe inclined toward peace.\" The president was persuaded and he called\nupon the Jews to present their trade proposals.  He set the condition,\nhowever, that the basis for the negotiations should be the sacramental\nagreement of 1485.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Finally, on July 31 and August 1, 1771, the <I>kahal\nparnosim</I> submitted an extensive memorial.  In it they described\ntheir critical financial situation, the debts of the <I>kahal </I>and\nof individual merchants and also the various imperial and <I>kahal\n</I>taxes, all of which weighed most heavily upon them.  From this\nmemorial it appears that the Jews owed the shlakhta and the Polish\ntownsmen about 850,000 zlotys.  The debt to the foreign merchants amounted\nto over 10,000 thaler.  In order to meet the <I>kahal </I>obligations,\nthey indicated that they needed 130,800 zlotys annually, which they\nderived from the members of the community by direct taxes and consumer\ntaxes.  In order to carry this burden they had to have a source of\nincome and only trade could serve as such.  The Jews of Cracow had\nengaged in trade since the most ancient times, notwithstanding the\ninterference of the gentile merchants.  They asked, therefore, not\nfor new rights or liberties but only that sanction be given to the\nactual condition.  At the same time they wished to restrict their trade\nonly to the most necessary goods and they yielded the trade in luxury\ngoods to the Christian merchants.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Jews demanded the right to trade in the following\nwares: (1) white goods: linen, canvass etc.; (2) woolen goods: cloth,\nDutch flannel, baize, mourning cloth, camlet; (3) silks; taffeta, damask;\n(4) notions: pins, needles, buttons, scissors, tobacco cases etc.;\n(5 ) furs: fur skins, rabbit, squirrel, etc.; (6) Turkish goods; rugs,\ndivans, night-caps, gloves, etc.; (7) spices: sugar, coffee, pepper,\nginger, etc.; (8) ornaments, lace; (9) skins, chamois, morocco, etc.;\n(10) handwork, used and new cloths; (11) brandy; (12) crafts: tailoring,\ncapmaking, furrier, lace-making, embroidery, gold and silver works.\nThe Jews offered to give up trade in (1) expensive cloth; (2) French\ncloth; (3) jewelry, diamonds, watches, credenzas, knives, candle-sticks,\nclostly mirrors; (4) Bavarian and English notions, better shoes, silver\nprongs, table ware; (5 ) iron: sickles, plough tips;\n(6) Armenian wares; (7) wax, costly wines, drugs, crystal glass,\netc.</P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Jewish proposals elicited a storm in the Cracow\nTown Hall, although it was apparent to all that no changes were\ninvolved in the trade relations in the city.  The deliberations dragged\non and they diligently studied the agreements of 1609 and 1615 and\nanalogous agreements in Lemberg and Posen.  Finally they sent\nan agreement to the lawyer in Warsaw.  It was signed by Feistmantel,\nFlorkowski, Bajer and others.  The agreement set forth that Jews were\npermitted to trade with the following wares in Cracow shops\nand warehouses, being forbidden, however, to distribute them to courts\nof nobles, churches and to the suburbs.  The list included (1) foreign\nlinens of various kinds (white, striped, cotton, tick, coarse linen,\nSilesian, Fustian) to be sold only by the piece and not by the\nyard, since there were many stores that bought by the piece and sold\nat a profit by the yard; (2) muslins, table cloths, napkins, towels,\n(single ones and in sets), linen for painted tapestries (by the piece\nand by the yard), linen kerchiefs by the dozen, cotton fleece tapestries\n(by the piece and by the yard), linen kerchiefs by the dozen, cotton\nfleece nightcaps; (3) cotton goods, chintz, batiste, lace, gauze; (4)\ngingham, baize (by the piece and by the yard); (5 ) ordinary cloth,\nboth smooth or striped and dotted, regular Fustian cloth (by the piece\nbut not by the yard); (6) Scottish woolens, regular wool and halfwool\n(except French and Dutch cloth, which were not to be brought in for\nsale), by the piece and not by the yard, various kinds of crepe, by\npiece, roll or yard; (7) genuine Brabant lace, lace work which the\nJewish women make, by the piece and by the yard; (8) pins, needles,\npipes, long pipes, thimbles, camels' hair; (9) thread, gut, whips;\n(10) rugs, divans, glazed linen, by the piece and by the yard; (11)\nheavy blankets, light blankets, army blankets, regular belts, mattresses,\nquilts (except embroidered), Turkish gowns, saddles, saddle accessories,\nwicks, tallow, Astrakhan short coats and cheaper ones, hats for finishing;\n(12) ladies' and men's second-hand clothing, remnants; (13) goods left\nin pawn; (14) artistic handwork like hand-made buttons.  There were\nalso two final points: (1) the cap makers' gild stood on its rights;\n(2) the wares must be first inspected in the municipal warehouses and\nonly thereafter be taken to their own shops and warehouses.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This time the magistracy seemed more liberal than\nbefore.  This was due to influence from Warsaw and also of the occupying\npower.  But this time too the magistracy sought to retain in its jurisdiction\nwhatever they could.  They retained almost entirely petty trading in\narticles of daily use, excluding thereby a whole series of products\nfrom Jewish trade.  Some gilds, like those of the tailors and capmakers,\ndid not want to relinquish their historic privileges, even though the\nJewish tailors and capmakers were twice or thrice as numerous as the\ngentile artisans.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The various proposals were returned to the Assessors\nCourt for final decision.  At the same time the court also took up\nthe controversy between the Kazimierz magistracy and the Jews concerning\nprevious Jewish misdeeds, such as ruining the city brick buildings,\ntrading with beer of foreign breweries, etc.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Kazimierz matter was turned over by the Assessors\nCourt on November 7, 1770 to the Cracow wojewoda.  But since Rzewuski\nwas still a prisoner in Moscow nothing was done about it until August\n10, 1772, when Kazimierz was in the hands of the Austrians.  Since\nthis time too the Jews were not able to produce the necessary documents\nand since the Polish rule was temporarily in abeyance, the Assessors\nCourt postponed action until the return of the native government. In\nthe meantime, however, the occupying power began to consider the\nmatter in its own way and in the light of its own interests. </P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">APPENDIX</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT OF GUTMAN RAKOWSKI MADE\nWHILE PRISONER OF THE CONFEDERATES IN LANCKORONA</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">(AMK, fasc.  Zydzi V.)</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Copy of the last will and testament of Gutman\nRakowski, head and <I>parnes </I>of the Jewish community of Kazimierz.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">We, the undersigned, do hereby testify that we hear\nthe words of Gutman Rakowski, of blessed memory, <I>parnes </I>of the\ncommunity of Kazimierz, who was imprisoned in Lanckorona during the\nConfederation by General Schiuz.  Imprisoned with him was\nYisroel Dawidowicz and they were visited by Lewek Jachimowicz, the\narendator of Czernichow and a goldsmith.  Through the latter,\nGutman's wife sent three shirts to the prison.  Gutman, of sound mind,\nmade a will in the presence of Lcwek Jachimowicz and Yisroel Dawidowicz\nand pronounced it in great sorrow.  The contents of the will was as follows:</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Listen my dear good friends!  I am now looking\nforward to death.  I cannot endure any more suffering.  I must seal\nwith my death the severe tortures, the imprisonment and hunger.\nI shall never again see my wife and children alive.  Lying all bruised\nand sick I wept bitterly that I must suffer unjust death for all the\nmembers of the Kazimierz community.  Please tell my wife that nothing\nwill be left to her after my death!  What will she do now and how will\nshe support herself?  I am now a pauper.  Whatever I had in cash or in\ngold, which I tried to hide from the Confederate troops, was taken from me.\nI was attacked suddenly, robbed of everything and everything in my home\nwas destroyed or seized.  I was tortured mercilessly and in my bare\nshirt I was led to prison through the very city in which I was <I>parnes</I>.\nThey perpetrated the worst deeds upon me.  They tore up valuable papers,\nimportant bills and notes of various nobles and churches and some from\nthe leaders of the Confederates too.  These had been given to me for\nvarious goods.  They were taken by force from my shop and they amounted\nto 2,000 zlotys or more.  I also had five notes from the deceased Prince\nJordan, the elder of Siedmiochow, for various goods that he had received\nfrom me.  These amounted to about 2,000 zlotys.  That they tore these\nup has brought me great grief.  What will my wife and children do without\nthese notes?</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">My own brick building I bequeath to no one except to\nmy son Isaac, who loaned me the sum of 2,000 zlotys for repairs.\nThe building belongs to no one but him, as it should be.  Counting\nprofit from that amount for this period would total about 3,000 zlotys\nor more.  This son of mine is the nearest relative and the first to\nreceive the debt owed to him just like the other creditors, for he spent\nmoney for me for various needs and repairs.  In addition to the\nabove-mentioned sum I also owe a still larger sum, of which I positively\nand truthfully here admit.  If anyone finds a signature of the name of\nmy son with any creditor let it be known that the signature is not\ngenuine and does not have validity since he did not sign it.  A noble\nlord prescribed that I bring some one to vouch for me or else that my\nson should sign with me.  Since my son was not in Poland at the time\nbut abroad and I did not want to reveal this to any one, I brought my\nservant and he signed for my son.  My son did not know of this.\nIt grieves me that now too he is not in Poland and I shall never see\nhim again.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">All the above was pronounced before us, the\nundersigned, by Gutman Rakowski, of blessed memory, head\nand <I>parnes</I> of the community,\nwhile imprisoned by the Confederates in Lanckorona.  He made this will\nand read it to us before be died and while of sound mind.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">To this we testify in best of faith and attach our\nsignature, this 18th day of June 1771.</P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">(Signed) LEWEK JACHIMOWICZ</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">YISROEL DAWIDOWICZ</P>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
