In particular, I would like to be able to \nshow that in at least one natural sense (and more likely in several natural\nsenses), the Euler characteristic of X is 1.\n\nDefine X_n as the subset of X containing all sequences (x_1, x_2, ...) \nfor which all terms past the nth term vanish (so that X is the union of\nthe X_n's), define a 0-cell in X as a point in X, and for k &gt; 1 define a \nk-cell in X as a regular open subset of some X_n that is homeomorphic to the \ninterior of a k-ball.  Suppose X is written as a disjoint union of 0-cells, \n1-cells, 2-cells, etc., such that for all k &gt; 0, the boundary of any k-cell \nin the decomposition can be written as a union of the 0-cells, 1-cells, ...,\nand (k-1)-cells in the decomposition.  Define the Poincare series associated\nwith this decomposition as the power series in t in which the coefficient \nof t^k is the number of k-cells in the decomposition.  \n\n* Must this Poincare series have an analytic continuation to a neighborhood \n* of t=-1, taking the value 1 at the point itself?\n\nExample: Let D_n denote the boundary of X_n and I_n denote the interior of\nX_n.  We can decompose X into X_0, D_1-X_0, I_1, D_2-X_1, I_2, D_3-X_2, I_3,\netc., yielding a decomposition with 2 0-cells, 2 1-cells, 2 2-cells, etc.\nThe Poincare series is thus 2 + 2t + 2t^2 + ..., whose analytic extension\nto the plane (punctured at t=+1) takes the value 1 at t=-1.\n\nI have framed my question somewhat narrowly, but I'm interested in other \nquestions of the same sort, and I'd like to know about any relevant work \nthat's been done.\n\nJim Propp\nDepartment of Mathematics\nMIT\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:propp@math.mit.edu\">propp@math.mit.edu</A> (Jim Propp)\n<B>Date:</B>           27 Jan 1997 12:24:59 -0500\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math.research\n<B>Subject:</B>        a loopy calculation\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nHere's a somewhat screwy way to calculate the Euler characteristic of the\nloop space of the sphere.  Does anyone know of a theory that explains why\nthis calculation gives the right answer (1), and that explains under what \ncircumstances the low-tech combinatorial/analytical approach sketched below \ngives the correct Euler characteristic for other mapping-spaces?\n\n1) Let X be the sphere, written as a disjoint union of 2 points, 2 open \nintervals, and 2 open disks; the closures of these six sets will be called \ncells.  The cells are ordered by inclusion, forming a finite poset that \nwe'll call P.  We put the order topology on P so that the closed subsets \nof P are just the order-ideals of P; that is, the closure of an element \nof P is the set of all cells that are subsets of that cell.  (Motivation: \nwe will look at the loop space of P instead of the loop space of X, which \nis a win since P is finite.)\n\n2) Write S^1 as [0,1] with its endpoints identified.  Choose a point x in \none of the open disks in X, and let F be the set of smooth maps from S^1 \nto X that take 0 to x.  We want to calculate the Euler characteristic of F,\nbut F is too complicated.  So...\n\n3) Consider the map c that sends each point in X to the smallest closed cell \ncontaining it.  If we compose any map f in F with the map c, we get a map\ng from S^1 to P (a simpler sort of map than f, since the range is a finite \nset).  Moreover, the new map g is continuous relative to the order topology \non P.  The map from F to G is sort of a retraction, so we \"reason\" that the \nEuler characteristic of F equals the Euler characteristic of G. \n\n4) Say that a map in G has a jump at t (0 &lt; t &lt; 1) if the map is not\nconstant on any neighborhood of t.  Each map in G has only finitely many \njumps (because each map in F was smooth).  Let G_n(t_1,t_2,...,t_n)  \n(with t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; ... &lt; t_n) be the set of maps in G that have jumps at \nt_1,t_2,...,t_n and no other points; this is a finite set whose cardinality \n(call it a_n) depends only on n, not on the t_i's.  (To specify a map with \njumps at certain locations, one need only specify the value of the map at \nthe jumps and between the jumps, subject to the continuity constraint and \nto the condition that there be genuine jumps at those locations.)\n\n5) Let G_n be the set of maps in G with exactly n jumps (the union of the \naforementioned sets as the t_i's vary, with n fixed).  Then G_n fibers over \nan open n-simplex (namely the set of all (t_1,t_2,...,t_n) with t_1 &lt; t_2 \n&lt; ... &lt; t_n), and the open simplex has combinatorial Euler characteristic \n(-1)^n; since all the fibers have cardinality (and Euler characteristic) \na_n, it is reasonable to say that G_n has Euler characteristic (-1)^n a_n.\n\n6) The sum a_0 - a_1 + a_2 - a_3 + ... does not converge.  However, if\none determines the a_n's explicitly one finds that the power series \na_0 - a_1 t + a_2 t^2 - a_3 t^3 + ... is the Taylor series of the \nrational function (1+8t-8t^2)/(1+12t-12t^2); and, plugging in the value \nt=1, we get the final answer 1, as expected.\n\nJim Propp\nDepartment of Mathematics\nMIT\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
