They are also located in the WWW virtual \nlibrary of law.  Both of these document URLs have various law schools \nlocated in their database.  The law schools and law firms document URL \nalso has law firms which helps the student to look ahead for after law \nschool.

Lynx is a text-only \nWorld  Wide Web client.  It does not display graphics and therefore is \nmuch  faster than Mosaic.  \nRight now Lynx can be run on UNIX and VMS.  Mosaic is a browser that \nallows you to access sound, binary pictures, moving pictures, as well as \ntext.  It is currently the most popular browser, because of these \nassets.  Additionally, it the browser this ICS.1C class is using.  There \nis also a third World Wide Web browser, Netscape, which is gaining ground \non Mosaic in terms of being the most popular Web browser.<A \nHREF=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?mosaic\">Mosaic</A> & <A \nHREF=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?lynx\">Lynx</A> <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>What is a document URL?</B></A><br>\nA document URL is a string of characters that distinguish a resource on the \ninternet and identifies the type of media that is being used.  It allows for \nthe linking within HTML hypertext read by \nWeb browsers.  URLs create information spaces on the Web in terms of the \nprotocol used and the spaces represent a big well of knowledge that the \nWeb can dip its jug in.The basic format for many URLs is :  \nscheme://host:port/path.  \nThe scheme is one of the ways to retrieve or send information through the \ninternet.  The host is the computer that the resource is located in.  The \nport is a number that distinguishesthe service you are requesting from \nthe host.  The path is an the location of a resource on a particular \nhost. <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/urls.html\">URLs</A> & <A \nHREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html\">HTML</A> <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>Name two URLs that have the latest sports \ninformation, choose one and give some information on three of the \nmajor sports.</B></A><br> Two \nURLs that have the latest sports information are Satchel Sports \nand the Mercury Newspaper sports page.  Satchel sports is a very detailed \nsports information server that has everything a sports fan could want.  \nIt even keeps up to date on sports that are not even in season.  I found \nout information about three of my home teams.  The San Jose Sharks beat \nthe Vancouver, British Columbia Canucs by a score of 3 to 1.  The San \nFrancisco 49ers released defensive tackle Richard dent because he is \ninjured and has a very big salary.  The Golden State Warriors'  Chris \nMullin injured himself at home when he fell and had a concussion.  It is \nnot known when he will be able to return back to basketball.<A \nHREF=\"http://www.starwave.com/nhl/prior1/vansan-rcp.html\">Sharks </A>  & \n<A HREF=\" http://www.starwave.com/nba/top/t160434001.html\">Warriors</A> & \n<A HREF=\" http://www.starwave.com/nfl/hln/t150624001-hln.html\">49ers</A>\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>Where are some of the current governors in the \nstates of the United States located and name at least two governors who \nyou did not know before and give some of their responsibilities, and/or \naccomplishments or information about them. </B></A><br>Each of the \ngovernments of each of \nthe states in the United States is listed under the state World Wide Web \nServers.
