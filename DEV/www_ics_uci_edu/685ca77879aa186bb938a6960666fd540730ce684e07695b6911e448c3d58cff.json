Below\nis a list of items that should be included in your third deliverable.</P>\n\n<hr>\n<h3>Due Date</h3>\n<p>\nTBD.\n\n<hr>\n<h3> Document Contents </h3>\n\n<h4>Introduction</h4>\n\n<P>Expand your introduction to discuss your specific approaches to the\ndesign of the system.</P>\n\n<h4>Understanding</h4>\n\n<P>This will basically be the same as in your original document. Make sure\nit describes what steps or actions you took to understand each technology\nor software. If you make changes to this section, add text describing why\nthe change was necessary, and why it more accurately reflects your new\nunderstanding. If your understanding hasn't changed, then this section does\nnot need to be different.</P>\n\n<h4>Project Plan</h4>\n\n<P>This will be an iterative expansion of your previous submission. Expand\nyour project plan to represent how you have accomplished the work so far.\nExpand your task network or work breakdown structure to the level of detail\nneeded to complete this task. Based on the work you have done, revise your\nestimates on how much your team can accomplish and deliver. If you make\nchanges, add text describing why the change was necessary or why it will\nimprove the ability of your team to accomplish the work you have proposed.</P>\n\n<h4>Requirements</h4>\n\n<P>This will basically be the same as in your previous document. If any\nrequirements are changed, added or deleted, make this explicit. Describe\nwhy the requirement was changed/added/deleted and by whom ( customer, developer,\netc.). Again make sure your requirements meet the objectives of completeness,\nunderstandbility, utility, no ambiguity, consistency.  If your requirements\nhave not changed, then this section may be identical to what you submitted\nearlier.</P>\n\n<h4>Architecture/Module Specifications</h4>\n\n<ol type=I>\n<li>Architecture Overview\n\n\t<ol type=A>\n\t<li> Architectural Style\n\t<br> What style of architecture did you adopt?  Provide a reference to a \n\tdefining document.\n\t<li> System Architecture Overview\n\t<br> This is the place for your \"one great diagram\" that shows how your\n\tsystem is built.  You might want to use more than one diagram, to show,\n\te.g., some different abstractions of the design (such as a data flow\n\tview, a layers of abstraction view, or an OS process view)\n\t<li> Component Narrative -- what each subsystem means\n\t<li> Major Limitations on the Current Design\n\t</ol>\n\n<li>Modules/Objectives\n\n\t<ol type=A>\n\t<li> List of Objects within your system\n\t<li> For each module/object, provide a Class Specification\n\t\n\t\t<ol type=1>\n\t\t<li> Name\n\t\t<li> Definition - what it is/does\n\t\t<li> Narrative/Comment, How it works\n\t\t<li> What are the object's APIs? E.g., using Java terminology\n\n\t\t\t<ol type=a>\n\t\t\t<li> public\n\t\t\t<li> private\n\t\t\t<li> protected\n\t\t\t</ol>\n\n\t\t<li> Data - What state does it keep, what variables? Who has the \n\t\t\taccess to it?\n\t\t<li> How does it fit into the inheritance/with/uses heirarchy?\n\t\t<li> Constraints - what constraints are there for this object/module?\n\t\t<li> Cardinality - How many will there be?\n\t\t</ol>\n\n\t<li> Other useful diagrams : Uses, Composed-of, API's Class-Category Diagrams,\n\t\tDesign Class diagrams, or other useful diagrams.\n\t<li> Design Object Scenario. Pick one object/ module and show the complete\n\t\timplementation detail of a key mechanism.\n\t</ol>\n\n<li> File Structure and Global Data - how will your objects / modules\n\tbe kept, sub-directories, Makefiles , etc.\n\n<li> Requirements Cross Reference - what objects/modules satisfy what requirements?\n\tMake a table, make a table, make it complete and consistent.\n\n<li> Testing Plan - How and when will you test it?\n\n<li> Demonstration Plan - How and what will you demonstrate?\n</ol>\n\n<h4>5. Documentation</h4>\n\n<ol type=I>\n<li> List the documents you have developed during this phase of the project.\n<li> Reference Documents\n\t<br>List here the major sources of information that you will be using during\n\tthe remainder of the project.\n</ol>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
