Our\ncolleagues in the Illinois Research Group on Classification, University of\nIllinois at Urbana- Champaign,  have been helpful in forming the basis for a\nsocial analysis of classification (Niranjan Karnik, Randi Markussen, Laura\nNeumann, Karen Ruhleder, Stefan Timmermans).   We also thank the Advanced\nInformation Technologies Group, University of Illinois,  for project support.\nConversations with Kari Thoresen about the notion of texture in organizations\nwere very helpful, as were ongoing conversations with Anselm Strauss about\ntrajectory.  The work of Mark Casey Condon on the nature of time morality in a\nmen's homeless shelter was helpful in thinking through issues in the concluding\nsection.<p>\n<p>\n<i>The experience of a long-term chronic illness weaves together problems in\nbiography, the body, and the cultural and organizational meanings of the\ndisease.  Time meets infrastructure; experience meets classification.  We\npresent here a close reading of two studies of tuberculosis, Thomas Mann's\nnovel The Magic Mountain  and Julius Roth's empirical work, Timetables.\nDrawing on research in medical sociology and information science, we show how\nthe trajectories of disease, biography and institution weave together.\nMismatches in the trajectories produce distortions (or torques) in time and\nsense of self, accounting for the phantasmagoric imagery often associated with\ntuberculosis.  We conclude with some general observations about how the concept\nof trajectory might be used in understand the intersection of biography and\norganization. </i><p>\n<i></i><b></b><p>\n<b></b><u>Introduction</u><p>\n<u></u>\"<i>TB is a disease of time; it speeds up life, highlights it,\nspiritualizes it.</i>\" (Sontag, 1977, p.  14)<p>\n<p>\n\tThe further one stands away from the disease of tuberculosis, the more it\nseems like a single, uniform phenomenon. It is associated with one of the great\nphilosophical breakthroughs in medicine - Koch developed his \"postulates\" for\ndefining disease agency partly with TB in mind.  Indeed, he could hardly avoid\nit since epidemiologists assure us that at the time he wrote them, 1881, <i>one\nseventh of all reported human deaths</i>, and one third of deaths of\n\"productive middle age\" groups were attributable to TB (Brock, 1988, pp. 117,\n179-180, emphasis added). Yet this single disease, the holocaust of those in\ntheir prime, has historically proved an elusive thing to classify.  The work of\nclassification has involved at many levels a complex ecology between\nlocalization, standardization and time.<p>\n\tTB also holds an important place in popular culture.  For example, the gambler\nDoc Holliday was a legendary \"gunslinger\" and partner of Wyatt Earp and his\nbrother, the famed American Wild West law enforcers. He suffered from TB, and a\nnumber of movies and books portray him with the disease. <p>\n<i>\t\"Lunger,\" screams the outlaw at Doc Holliday, \"come out and fight.  Prepare\nto die.\"  Holliday appeared twice recently on the big screen, in the Hollywood\nfilms \"Tombstone\" and \"Wyatt Earp.\"  In both, his pale face, glistening with\nsweat,  is used as a counterpoint to his devil-may-care lifestyle and his\ngun-happy camaraderie with the Earps.  The six years he spent in a sanitarium\nat the end of his life in Glenwood Springs ,Colorado go unexplored.  His\ntombstone there reads, \"He died in bed.\"  As a final irony in the story of\nromancing disease, localization, and macho myth, another stone reads, \"Here\nlies Doc Holliday whose body is buried somewhere in this cemetery.\"  It seems\nthe body was hidden after he died from potential revenge-seekers; its exact\nwhereabouts has been lost in the records.</i><a\nhref=\"tb_fn.html#fn0\">[1]</a><i></i><p>\n<i>\t</i>Body-snatching and the failure to reach a final localized resting place\npermeate the history of tuberculosis.  As we proceed with this story, the\ninterweaving of myth, biography, science, medicine and bureaucracy becomes\nthicker and thicker, eluding attempts at standardization and localization from\nevery angle.  Just for this reason, though, the story of TB holds some profound\ninsights about how those threads intertwine, tense against each other, and form\nthe texture of a landscape of time.  <p>\n\tWe bring a number of intellectual tools to the analysis of this landscape.\nSocial studies of science have moved to crisscross nature, culture (including\nartifacts) and discourse in a seamless web (Latour, 1993); activity theory adds\nthe concept of mediation for tools, cognition and community.  We emphasize as\nwell the importance of ongoing hybrid arrangements, in the form of\ninfrastructures of classification and bureaucracy (Bowker, Timmermans &amp;\nStar, 1995; Bowker &amp; Star, 1994; Star &amp; Ruhleder, 1996; Star, 1995). We\ndraw as well on some concepts from medical sociology:  notions of\nbody-biography-trajectory (Corbin &amp; Strauss, 1988; 1991) and the temporal\nlessons of chronic illness (Charmaz, 1992). We seek to re-center the ways in\nwhich time and infrastructure interact, to illuminate the texture of this web\nso crisscrossed with great divides that in literature and popular myth, the\nwhole borderland has taken on a phantasmagoric shape, unrecognizable to those\nundergoing the experience. <p>\n<p>\n<u>Part 1 Classification</u><p>\n\tThe question has often been posed in the social and cultural study of\nmedicine: whose body is it anyway that is getting analyzed? (Berg &amp; Bowker,\nin press)  This question is as old as the development of statistics (Hacking,\n1990):  Quetelet sought for the \"ideal type\" in a statistical analysis of a\nregiment of Scottish soldiers. With tuberculosis, the  body is constantly in\nmotion,  and the disease is constantly in motion.  The disease may be localized\nor spread throughout the body; the state or general condition of the body and\nof the person's life enters into the treatment regime, which may take months\nand historically has taken years or a lifetime.  Thus,  any classification\nsystem should include both spatial and temporal dimensions, but standardized\nclassifications tend to emphasize space alone.  That is, classifications are\nrarely  developmental, and often presented as spatial demographic\ndistributions.  Even where stages of a disease may be categorized, these stages\nare abstracted away from biographical continuity and more subtle temporal\nissues.  As the problems of time emerge in the lives of patients and the work\nof classifiers, those spatial compartments break down in interesting ways: a\nformal hierarchy of mutually exclusive categories becomes a set of overlapping\ncontradictory classes. The formal thesis of this paper is that when the work of\nclassification abstracts away the flow of historical time, then the goal of\nstandardization can only be achieved at the price of leakages in the\nclassification system (cf. Hacking, 1995). Under certain conditions, the\nshifting terrain between standardized classification and the situated biography\nof the patient is <i>twisted</i> across an axis of negotiation, scientific work\nand instruments, suffering, and time.<p>\n\t<u>1.1 The disease is constantly in motion</u><p>\n<u></u>\tTuberculosis is a moving target. It is often presented as the great\nepidemic disease with a cure - heralding the famous optimism (ironically, just\nas AIDS was developing and newly-resistant strains of TB on the rise) that\nepidemic disease could be eradicated from the planet.  In September 1994 the\nWorld Health Organization made a worldwide press release predicting the\neradication of polio from the planet by the year 2000\n(http://www.who.ch/programmes/gpv/tEnglish/avail/polio.htm).   A year earlier\nsociologist Fred Davis, who suffered polio in his youth, and one of the  most\neloquent analysts of uncertainty in illness (Davis, 1963) died of a stroke at\nthe age of 65 -- was this stroke in part the legacy of his earlier illness?\nMany of those who had polio in the 1940s and 1950s are now beginning to lose\ntheir ability to walk as their overburdened spinal cells, designed for backup\npurposes, are wearing out after years of tough therapy and rehabilitation.   Is\nthe disease thus eradicated -- or delayed?  In the lives of these patients, the\nanswer is not so clear. And they remain invisible to the original\nclassifications.<p>\n\tAs Barbara Bates has pointed out (Bates, 1992, pp. 320-321) many observers\n\"now attribute the decline of tuberculosis chiefly to socioeconomic changes\"\n(pp. 320-321). A historically fully contingent rise in standard of living\naccompanied by less crowded conditions in the cities possibly worked the real\nmiracle. Others, she points out, offer a more brutal, but still completely\nhistorical cause for the cure: they argue that it is a matter of natural\nselection, and what has happened is simply that those humans most susceptible\nto the disease are now dead. This sort of convergence is a problem in much\nscientific and medical research,  and increasingly so (Bowker, 1994; Timmermans\n&amp; Berg, in press; Latour, 1993).   Here we have a \"global truth\" - the cure\nfor TB - that may have been true because the \"fitter ones survived\"  (the\nsusceptible members died out) <i>or</i> because human environments changed\n(better living conditions) <i>or</i> because there is now an allopathic cure.<a\nhref=\"tb_fn.html#fn0\">[2]</a> It is impossible to decide between these three\ncauses, since according to the first two humanity before the \"cure\" (whichever\none plumps for) is not the same thing as humanity after the cure - either the\nrace will have changed biologically or the infrastructure that makes us know\nwhat we are will have altered.<p>\n\tThe disease has its own history, a broken and contested path. In a series of\nworks put out by the National Tuberculosis Association from 1950 to the\npresent, TB often figures wryly as an actor in the text: much as Roy Porter\n(1990) has noted that \"gout\" in the eighteenth century had a character of its\nown. Thus the 1961 edition of the Diagnostic Standards and Classification of\nTuberculosis noted that: <p>\n<p>\nFor our present purposes, therefore, tuberculosis is defined as that infectious\ndisease caused by one of several closely related mycobacteria, including M\ntuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. avium. It usually involves the lungs, but it\nalso involves and sometimes produces gross lesions in other organs and tissues.\nThe clinical and pathologic pictures may range from acute to chronic. (p. vi)\n<p>\n<p>\n\tTB taken as an agent traverses history and human bodies, taking hold in some\nand leaving others in a contingent historical progression, reaffirming the\nuneven, hierarchical value given to different patient's lives (Glaser &amp;\nStrauss, 1965). The disease hits at different points in the life cycle (ibid.,\np.  6); thus becomes a complex mirror composed of nature, culture, discourse\nand infrastructure.  <p>\n\t<u>1. 2 The body is constantly in motion</u><p>\n\tThe development of X-rays was perhaps the most significant breakthrough in the\ndetection and diagnosis of tuberculosis (Pasveer, 1989). Unfortunately, the\nbody itself is constantly in motion and varies by individual: so the ideal\nmeasurement is always a projection from a moving picture onto a timeless chart:\n<p>\n<p>\nThe perfect chest roentgenogram . . . is the aim of those who practice\nroentgenology. The very nature of the problem prevents the realization of this\naim. The chest is a moving, dynamic part of the body and cannot be completely\nstill. It varies from person to person. In some it is thin and easy to\npenetrate. In others it is thick and heavy from fat or muscle and hard to\npenetrate. Some lungs are stiff and hard to inflate. Others are made full and\nvoluminous without great effort. To register lungs satisfactorily with these\nvariables is at all times difficult. (Diagnostic Standards, 1955, p.  71) <p>\n<p>\n\tFurther, each body subject to TB is going through its own biographical and\nphysiological, historical development - and as it develops TB changes. Thus:\n\"the clinical picture of serious necrotic lesions of primary tuberculosis and\nwidespread disseminations from them is observed more often in infancy than in\nlater life and more frequently in nonwhite than in white persons.\" (Diagnostic\nStandards, 1955, p. 17). Thomas Mann describes one of the TB sanitarium.\npatients in <i>The Magic Mountain: </i>responding to another's new diagnosis of\na \"moist spot\": <i> </i><p>\n<i></i>You can't tell,\" Joachim said.  \"That is just what you never can tell.\nThey said you had already had places, of which nobody took any notice and they\nhealed of themselves, and left nothing but a few trifling dullnesses.  It might\nhave been the same way with the moist spot you are supposed to have now, if you\nhadn't come up here at all.  One can never know.  (Mann, 1929, p.192)<p>\n<p>\n<p>\n\tNot only the disease and the body, but also the patient's experience moves\nconstantly. Thus Bates points out that institutionalization in a sanitarium may\nwell have worked because the relationships with nurses, doctors and other\npatients - together with removal from bad home conditions - may have done the\nwork. She summarizes: \"Psychological factors have long been thought to alter\nthe course of tuberculosis, but their actual impact on outcomes is not\nknown...\" (Bates, 1992, p. 320).<p>\n<p>\n\t<u>1.3  Classification: a still life constantly in motion</u><p>\n\tWith all these historical trajectories being inscribed into the course of\ntuberculosis at whatever unit of analysis one took (humanity, the disease, the\nbody or the experience of the patient) it will come as no surprise that the\nwork of classifying tuberculosis has generally had very complex temporal\nramifications; and these ramifications have often led to problems in\nclassification.  It has also led to a sense by those in sanatoria of TB as\ninhabiting a phantasmagoric landscape, a borderland filled with monstrous\nexperiences and distortions of time and self (Mann, 1929; Roth, 1963).  The\nreasons for this are not simply the physical horrors of the disease, though\nthose are terrible enough, but the ways in which our strands play out against\neach other in imagination.  <p>\n\tOne wants to classify tuberculosis first and foremost in order to say yeah or\nnay, whether a particular patient has the disease. This information can be used\nin order to suggest a treatment plan for the patient, and a map of action for\nofficials in public health (Should we  quarantine, isolate, educate, or give\nantibiotics?)  This classification work is not easy. In the first place, the\ndisease itself is multifaceted:  \"When faced with a difficult diagnosis, the\nclinician does well to keep tuberculosis in mind, for its mode of onset and\ncourse are protean. This needs to be urged all the more now that tuberculosis\nis becoming relatively less frequent.\" (Diagnosis, 1955, p. 23)<p>\n\tFurther, it does not have a single cause: most TB in humans, according to\nofficial accounts, is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis, but one should not\nforget mycobacterium bovis and mycobacterium avium. It does not appear in a\nsingle place - generally the lungs are affected, but it could produce lesions\nin many other organs and tissues. Star (1989) notes that the disease's spread\nimplicated it in all investigations of nervous and brain disease in the\nnineteenth century; whether a patient had a brain or spinal tumor or TB was\noften unclear; the disease may cause seizures, paralysis, lameness or dementia.\nThomas Mann poses of one of his characters:  \"the question whether the disease\nwould be arrested by a chalky petrifaction and heal by means of fibrosis, or\nwhether it would extend the area, create still larger cavities, and destroy the\norgan.\" (Mann, 1929, p.447)<p>\n\tAnd indeed even pulmonary TB - its most common form and one of the greatest\nkillers in the history of humanity - cannot be simply classified: <p>\n<p>\nThe lesions of tuberculosis are highly diverse in appearance, and their\nmanifestations are numerous. No single system of classification can give\ninformation which completely describes the lesions. Certain classifications and\ndescriptions are needed, however, for records and for statistical purposes...\nthe status of a patient's disease at the time of diagnosis, and at any time in\nthe months and years thereafter. These basic classifications should be used for\nall cases. (Diagnosis, 1961, p. 39)<p>\n\t<p>\nAnd they recommend that this basic classification should tell a story,\ndetailing extent of disease, status of clinical activity, bacteriologic status,\ntherapeutic status, exercise status and other \"lifestyle\" variables as they are\ncalled nowadays. <p>\n\tMedical classification work as based on the International Classification of\nDiseases (ICD), however, does not tell a story - it records a fact (one died of\nthe disease or not). 3  There is a complex narrative written into the death\ncertificate that is the primary outcome of the ICD: doctors and later health\nworkers must sift multiple causes of death to determine proximate, contributing\nand underlying causes (Fagot-Largeault, 1989). But this is an impoverished\nstory, with only a small range of contributing causes. The ICD cannot contain a\nprotean disease.<a href=\"tb_fn.html#fn1\">[4]</a>  It is oriented towards a\ncause-and-effect that resembles a set of slots or bins, or blanks on a form,\neven where it is multi-valanced and multi-slotted; it is not, like disease and\ndiagnosis, messy, leaky, liquid, and textured with time.  Indeed, the problem\nof tuberculosis has been a long-standing problem for the ICD - leading to the\nconvening of several special committees to produce a standard (Biraben,\n1988).<p>\n\tStandard medical classifications, though they may leak at the edges and become\nconfigurationally complex, do not reflect the temporal complexity of the\ndisease itself (Clarke  &amp; Casper, 1996). They do not represent its\ncomposite, amodern nature:  culture, nature, discourse and infrastructure.\nThey posit a single answer to the question of whether this person has TB or\nnot.  However, as Desrosi&egrave;res (1993, p. 296) has pointed out with\nrespect to <i>all</i> statistical work, this kind of difficulty leads to a\ncontradiction between a logical, top-down approach which accounts for all\ntraits, and a local, pragmatic one which registers the phenomenon as locally\nencountered.  It is one of the purest forms of a deduction vs. induction\ndebate.<a href=\"tb_fn.html#fn2\">[5]</a> <p>\n\tFor most of the nineteenth century - and into the twentieth - TB was believed\nto be hereditary.  What was classified was a tuberculoid kind of a person, a\ntemperament: romantic, melancholy, given to emotional extremes, hot cheeked and\nso on.  Sontag notes that just before Koch discovered the tubercule bacillus, a\nstandard medical text gave the cause of TB as  \"hereditary disposition,\nunfavorable climate, sedentary indoor life, defective ventilation, deficiency\nof light, and `depressing emotions.' \"(1977, p.  54)  She also writes of the\nliterary and popular cultural images of TB, noting that many writers have\nreferred to TB as \"ethereal,\" \"chaste,\" and somehow pure and mental, not\nphysical.   \"TB is celebrated as the disease of born victims, of sensitive,\npassive people who are not quite life-loving enough to survive.\" (1977, p.  25)\nIn some circles in the nineteenth century, this became a romantic image,\nespecially for middle-class white women:  \"The recurrent figure of the\ntubercular courtesan indicates that TB was also thought to make the sufferer\nsexy.\"  (1977, p.25).  Eventually, this romance bled over into a more diffuse\nconcept of style of life and crafting of self.  Sontag even states:   \"The\nromanticizing of TB is the first widespread example of that distinctively\nmodern activity, promoting the self as an image.  The tubercular look had to be\nconsidered attractive once it came to be considered a mark of distinction, of\nbreeding.\"  (p. 29) The mythic person with TB became a romantic exile, and the\nmyth \"supplied an important model of bohemian life, lived without or without\nthe vocation of the artist.  The TB sufferer was a dropout, a wanderer in\nendless search of the healthy place.\" (p. 33)<p>\n\tThe work of finding a cure thus involved myriad classificatory activities\ninserted into a shifting ecology of metrologies and images about temperament\nand constitution (Star, 1995).  Bates (1992, p. 28) notes that members of the\nClimatological Association in the 1920s compiled measures of altitude,\nhumidity, temperature, sunlight, dampness of the soil, ozone in the air and\nemanations from pine and balsam forests in order to uncover and classify the\nideal placement for sanitarium situation. As she somewhat sardonically notes,\nthough, a skeptic: \"might notice that many of the otherwise disparate\nconclusions shared one characteristic: physicians tended to discover\nhealth-giving attributes in their own locales\" (p. 28).<p>\n\tIt was (and is) also not clear when to <i>stop</i> classifying TB. As the\nfollowing report on Bergey's manual of determinative bacteriology notes -\napparently without irony - there is a need to bring order into the\nclassification \"unclassified\" when talking about TB.  the manual lists four\nsubtypes  of unclassified strains ( (Diagnostic Standards, 1961, p. 17)  So one\ncan have an \"other\" or residual category, but at some point even the garbage\ncan will have to be ordered, when it becomes large enough.<p>\n\tFurther, the committee on the classification of tuberculosis was forced to\nrecognize in general that: \"all classifications are ephemeral\" (Diagnosis,\n1955, p. 6 - quoting the 1950 edition). They fully recognized the temporary,\nagreed-upon nature of their classification work.   In infrastructural work such\nas the development of classification systems,  there is much greater\nsensitivity to such factors than appears in the published scientific papers:\n\"Complete agreement . . .  is impossible . . . The classification presented\nrepresents a well- considered compromise of the views of outstanding\nclinicians.\"(Diagnosis, 1955, p. 5 - quoting the 1950 edition). <p>\n\tIndeed, the historiography presented by the texts of diagnostic handbooks was\na mixture of pure Whiggish progress tinged with despair (\"without roentgenology\nthe fight against TB would be back where is was in the nineteenth century\" -\nDiagnosis, 1961, p.67) and a cyclical view of history that Vico would not have\nbeen ashamed to espouse:<p>\n<p>\nReaders will note another of those shifts in emphasis which have characterized\nexpositions of the pathogenesis of tuberculosis for thirty-five years. The\nconcepts presented in the current edition are more closely allied to those of\nformer years than to the views expressed in the last edition. (Diagnostic\nStandards, 1955, p. 7)<p>\n<p>\nOr again, from the 1961 edition:<p>\n<p>\nThe one item of change upon which all of our consultants agreed was the need\nfor a classification to include the increasing number of cases which are\nneither truly \"active\" nor \"inactive,\" and, chiefly, cases of the \"open\nnegative syndrome.\" In defining such a new class and seeking a suitable name\nfor it, we have reached back ten years and reinstated the once-retired term,\n\"quiescent,\" which was previously applied to an intermediate class. (Diagnostic\nStandards, 1961, p. v)<p>\n<p>\nThis example moves us into the terrain of tuberculosis and activity, which we\nwill consider in the next section. For our purposes here, though, it\nunderscores the situation of the classification act in an historical flow,\nwhere the pure progress of natural science is transmogrified by time,\nbiography, institutions, and myth.<p>\n<u></u><p>\n<u>Part 2 Freeze Frames: Snapshots of a Disease in Progress</u><cite></cite><p>\n<cite></cite><i>A positive skin test does NOT mean that you have tuberculosis;\nrather, that you may have been exposed to the organisms at some time in the\npast.  In this case, a chest x-ray must be obtained in order to be certain\nthere is no active disease. Additionally, if the reaction is positive, we will\nwant to review your history and talk to you about what you should do in the\nfuture.  --</i> Information given to students by the health center at the\nUniversity of Illinois.  (c)University of Illinois Board of Trustees <p>\n<b></b><p>\n<b></b>\tThroughout the history of tuberculosis classification, one of the key\nproblems has been how to convert a progressive, protean disease to a single\nmark on a sheet of paper. Many categories have been experimented with. One\nsuggested hallmark was whether or not one tested positive to the tuberculin\ntest. But as with HIV, it was decided that those who tested positive did not\n<i>have</i> the disease, they were: \"considered to have tuberculous infection\nbut not disease\" (Diagnosis, 1955, p. 25). Only those who could bring other\nevidence of disease to the table would be considered worthy of the\nclassification of pulmonary and non pulmonary tuberculosis.<p>\n\tThose who did have the disease, could be lumped into the categories\ninactive/active/activity undetermined. However, if: a \"provisional estimate of\nthe probable clinical status is necessary for public health purposes, the terms\n(a) \"Probably Active\" or (b) \"Probably Inactive\" should be used. Every effort\nshould be made to classify cases and to avoid this category\" (Diagnostic\nStandards, 1955, p. 28). By 1961, it was agreed that a classification somewhere\nbetween active and inactive was needed: this would be the \"open negative\nsyndrome\" and would, as we have just seen, have the word \"quiescent\" attached\nto it. \"Inactive\" would be redefined to include: \"constant and definite\nhealing\".  Ironically, and to underscore the attempt to separate disease from\nbiography,  \"dead\" was also recognized in this classification (p. 41) -\npresumably to stand as a cross between highly active and completely inactive!<p>\n\tBubbling out of the freeze frame with these leakages are the struggles with a\nshifting infrastructure of classification and treatment. Turning now to other\npresentations and classifications of TB by a novelist and a sociologist, we\nwill see the complex dialectic of irrevocably local biography and of standard\nclassification.  <p>\n<u>Part 3:  Moving Through Tuberculosis and Its Classification</u><p>\n<u></u>\tThe next sections rely on two detailed  readings of classic studies of\nTB sanatoria and hospitals.  The first is Thomas Mann's <i>The Magic\nMountain</i> (1929),  written in 1912, a 900+ -page tome chronicling a Swiss\nhospital and the 7-year sojourn of a young German engineer there, Hans Castorp.\nThe account was based on Mann's experience as a visitor to a similar\ninstitution during his wife's incarceration for lung disease.  The second is\nJulius Roth's <i>Timetables</i>, a comparative ethnographic analysis of several\nAmerican TB hospitals in the late 1950s.  This volume, too, has a strong base\nin Roth's own experience as a TB patient while he was writing his doctoral\ndissertation. <p>\n\t<u>3.1 The texture of time:  Lost to the world</u><p>\n\tWhen Hans Castorp, the hero of Mann's novel,  arrives in the Alps as a visitor\nto his tubercular cousin, one of his first lessons in local culture is the way\nthat values about time change for those \"up here.\"  Everything normal seems to\nchange for him, and the whole place seems macabre and oddly funny.   Later in\nthe novel he will explain to another newcomer:  \"I have no contact with the\nflat-land, it has fallen away.  We have a folk-song that says:  \"I am lost to\nthe world\" -- so it is with me.\"  (Mann, 1929, p. 614)  This lostness first\ntakes on the form of time passing very slowly, and in chunks that seem\nunimaginable to the newcomer:   \"We up here are not acquainted with such an\nunit of time as the week - if I may be permitted to instruct  you, my dear sir.\nOur smallest unit is the month.  We reckon in the grand style -- that is a\nprivilege we shadows have.\" (Mann, 1929, p. 59) <p>\n\tRoth compares the commitment to a TB sanitarium with having an \"indeterminate\nsentence\" for one's first year of jail -- not <i>knowing</i> how long one will\nbe incarcerated, not having any milestones or turning points that make sense,\nalso makes time seem endless, and distorted with respect to known landscapes,\nboth inner and outer. \"Where uniformity rules; and where motion is no more\nmotion, time is no longer time.\" (Mann, 1929, p.566)<p>\n\tThe patients in both Mann's and Roth's hospitals begin to speculate on the\nmeaning of this lost time, this \"time out.\"  Is time real, objective, something\nwhich can be measured externally -- or subjective, illusory?  Hans originally\nopts for a relativist explanation:  \"After all, time <i>isn't</i> 'actual.'\nWhen it seems long to you, then it is long; when it seems short, why, then it\nis short.  But how long, or how short, it actually is, that nobody knows.\"\n(Mann, 1929, p. 66)  His cousin Joachim, a rather hard-nosed soldier who wants\nonly to get off of the mountain and back to his regiment, disagrees, and says\n\"We have watches and calendars for the purpose; and when a month is up, why\nthen up it is, for you, and for me, and for all of us.\" (Mann, 1929, p.66)\nHans proceeds to demonstrate how slowly seven minutes can go by while taking\none's temperature, and we indeed feel the seconds creep by in Mann's precise\nlanguage.  What is \"the same?\"  he asks.  \"The schoolmen of the Middle Ages\nwould have it that time is an illusion; that its flow in sequence and causality\nis only the result of a sensory device, and their real existence of things in\nan abiding present.\" (Mann, 1929, p.566) <p>\n\tAs time goes on, up on the magic mountain and in each of the hospitals studied\nby Roth, people inside begin to develop a sense of how to fragment, break up\nthis unbroken monolith.  \"We are aware that the intercalation of periods of\nchange and novelty is the only means by which we can refresh our sense of time,\nstrengthen, retard, and rejuvenate it, and therewith renew our perception of\nlife itself.\" (Mann, 1929, p. 107) In one of his many meditations on the nature\nof time, Mann argues that time and action and space are not separable --\nnothing \"fills up\" time in a platonic-container sense, but that these facets\nare only knowable with respect to each other: <p>\n<p>\nWhat is time?  A mystery, a figment -- and all powerful.  It conditions the\nexterior world, it is motion married to and mingled with the existence of\nbodies in space, and with the  motion of these.  Would there then be no time if\nthere were no motion?  No motion if no time?   We fondly ask.  Is time a\nfunction of space?  Or space of time?  Or are they identical?  Echo answers.\nTime is functional, it can be referred to as action; we say a thing is \"brought\nabout\" by time.  What sort of thing?  Change? (Mann, 1929, p.  356)<p>\n<p>\n\tAt the core of this theory of action is the development of what Roth calls\n\"timetables,\" and which is alluded to in more symbolic terms by Mann.\nTimetables are breaks in space-time which give meaning to action.  They are\nconstructed mediational tools which help order and control mismatches between\ninstitution and individual.  When will I get out? What will become of me?   How\nwill I survive the boredom and the uncertainty of incarceration?  Such\nquestions are asked against the specter of unbroken time or eternity, or as\nRoth's patients and doctors put it for the hopeless cases: \"a rather horrifying\ntubercular Siberia -- a seemingly endless waster (of time) without any\nsignposts along the way.\" (Roth, 1963, p. 21)  or in Mann's words:  \"\"Only in\ntime was there progress; in eternity there was none, nor any politics or\neloquence either.\"  (Mann, 1929, p.479) <a href=\"tb_fn.html#fn3\">[6]</a><p>\n\tGradually a sense that there is in fact no such thing as unbroken time comes\nabout for the patients:<p>\nCan one tell -- that is to say, narrate -- time, time itself, as such, for its\nown sake?  That would surely be an absurd undertaking.  A story which read:\n\"time passed, it ran on, the time flowed onward\" and so forth -- no one in his\nsenses could consider that a narrative....For narration resembles music in\nthis, that it <i>fills up</i> the time.  It \"fills it in\" and \"breaks it up,\"\nso that \"there's something to it,\" \"something going on.\" (Mann, 1929, p.560)<p>\n<p>\n\tThe patients begin to fill their days with measurement.  On the magic\nmountain, people walk around with thermometers in their mouths, measuring their\ntemperatures several times a day; in both books, patients are conversant with\nthe details of diagnosis and measurement, the myriad of ways in which the\nmonolithic diagnosis may be broken up and measured.  As Roth says:  \"Everyone\nis frantically trying to find out how long <i>he</i> is in for.  The new\npatient questions the doctors, nurses, and other hospital personnel in an\neffort to discover how may years, months, and days it will take <i>him</i> to\nbe cured.\" (1963, p. xvi)<p>\n<b>\t</b><u>3.2 Metrology</u><b></b><p>\n<b>\t</b>The importance of mediational tools appears in struggles with\nmeasurement.<b>  </b>One woman has been a patient on the magic mountain for the\nbetter part of her life.  Eventually, she is cured of the disease and told to\ngo home.  But she knows no other life, and panics at the thought of leaving.<a\nhref=\"tb_fn.html#fn3\">[7]</a><b>   </b>She sabotages her release:  runs out in\nthe snow, jumps in the lake, and sticks her thermometer into her tea to make\nher appear feverish.  When she is discovered by the staff, they make her use a\nthermometer without any marks on it.  The device can only be read by a doctor\nwith a measuring stick.  The patient thus cannot calibrate her faking illness.\nThe patients come to call  this unmarked instrument \"the silent sister,\" and it\nbecomes the symbol for the ways in which the world of the asylum acquires its\nown bizarre culture of metrication and control.<p>\n\tRoth notes that patients are quite systematic in creating measurements for the\nblocks of time they will spend in the asylum.  They begin to construct\ntimetables for themselves (I will get out in six months; I will have surgery in\ntwo weeks, etc.)  \"After they have been in the hospital for some time, they\nfind that \"mild\" and \"bad\" are not very meaningful categories,\" and much more\ndetailed matching categories develop. (Roth, 1963, p.19)  Patients begin\nobserving how other patients are treated.  There is an elaborate system of\nprivileges in TB hospitals, based ostensibly on how healthy one is. If one is\nmaking good progress, for example, one is allowed out on brief shopping trips,\nand so forth.  \"He divides the patient group into categories, according to his\npredictions about/the course of their treatment.  He can then attach himself to\none of these categories and thus have a more precise notion of what is likely\nto happen to him than he could from simply following the more general norms.\"\n(Roth, 1963, pp. 16-17) <p>\n\tRoth goes on to describe an equally elaborate system of observations and\ncomparisons made by all the patients with respect to their own bodies, the\nlength of time \"served,\" the predilections of the individual doctors, and the\ntechnical diagnostic material such as x-rays.  Not surprisingly, much of the\ninformation available is partial or misleading: <p>\n<p>\nReference points may be more or less clear-cut and stable.  If they are\nprescribed in detail and rigidly adhered to, as in the career of pupils in a\nschool system, one's movement through the timetable is almost completely\npredictable.  As the reference points become less rigid and less clear-cut,\nthey must be discovered and interpreted through observation and through\ninteraction with others of one's career group.  The more unclear the reference\npoints are, the harder it is for members of a career group to know where they\nstand in relation to others and the more likely it is that they will  attend to\ninappropriate clues and thus make grossly inaccurate predictions concerning\nfuture progress.  The degree of stability is related in part to the changes in\ntimetables through time.  (Roth, 1963, pp. 99-100) <p>\n<p>\nManaging this instability increases the intensity of comparison and a sense,\noften, of bewilderment, unfairness, or even madness.  Hans Castorp says to his\ncousin:  <p>\n<p>\nI cannot comprehend why, with a harmless fever -- assuming for the moment, that\nthere is such a thing -- one must keep one's bed, while with one that is not\nharmless you needn't.  And secondly, I tell you the fever has not made me\nhotter than I was before.  My position is that 99.6deg. is 99.6deg..  If you\ncan run about with it, so can I.\" (Mann, 1929, p.176)<p>\n<p>\n\tGive me a standard, give me something to hold on to, something clear - in the\nface of uncertainty, patients become positivists.  Mann describes the rebellion\nof Hans' cousin again the system of metrication in the hospital, the \"Gaffky\nscore.\"  This is a composite score for each patient's progress based on a\nnumber of measures:  <p>\n<p>\nYes, the good, the patient, the upright Joachim, so affected to discipline and\nthe service, had been attacked by fits of rebellion, he even questioned the\nauthority of the \"Gaffky scale.\"  Whether only a few isolated bacilli, or a\nwhole host of them, were found in the sputum analyzed, determined his \"Gaffky\nnumber,\" upon which everything depended.  It infallibly reflected the chances\nof recovery with which the patient had to reckon; the number of months or years\nhe must still remain could with ease be deduced from it. (Mann, 1929, p.357)<p>\nThis questioning of authority  appears inevitable in a landscape so filled with\nuncertainty.  One character, a business person,  attempts to quantify health\ncare costs and the tradeoffs: <p>\n<p>\nThe expense, he whispered, was fixed at a thousand francs, including the\nanesthesia of the spinal cord; practically the whole thoracic cavity was\ninvolved, six or eight ribs, and the question was whether it would pay . . . he\nwas not at all clear that he would not do better just to die in peace, with his\nribs intact.  (Mann, 1929, p.315)<p>\n<p>\n\tIn the absence of metrics such as this, however, the relationships between\ndoctors and patients come under considerable strain as patients strive to\nassign themselves to the proper categories, and then to see whether the doctors\nagree with them (Berg, 1992).  In <i>The Magic Mountain</i>,  the inmate\nSettembrini, a slightly satanic character, whispers constantly to Hans about\nhow subjective the reading of the objective measures such as x-rays really is:\n<p>\n<p>\nYou know too that those spots and shadows there are very largely of\nphysiological origin.  I have seen a hundred such pictures, looking very like\nthis of yours; the decision as to whether they offered definite proof or not\nwas left more or less to the discretion of the person looking at them. (Mann,\n1929, p.250)<p>\n<p>\n\tBoth physicians and patients struggle to find a standard and to localize it,\nin the face of a constantly shifting interpretive frame.  As Roth notes:  <p>\n<p>\nThe physician finds it difficult to carry out the medical ideal of an\nindividual prescription for each case when at the same time he recognizes the\nfact that his timing of a given treatment event for a given patient is to a\nlarge extent a highly uncertain judgment on his part.  If you are going to\nguess, you might as well make the process more efficient by guessing about the\nsame way each time, especially if you are in a situation where your clients are\nlikely to think that you do not know what you are doing if you change your\nguess from one time to another. (1963, p.24) <p>\n<p>\nThis uncertainty leads to the struggles and negotiations that are at the heart\nof Roth's analysis. Whose timetable will prevail?<p>\n\t<u>3.3 Classification struggles:  Putting in time</u><p>\n\t\"The TB patient conceives of his treatment largely in terms of putting in time\nrather than in terms of the changes that occur in his lungs.\" (Roth, 1963, p.\nxv)  The length of time one has been inside, combined with patients'\nobservations about where they  belong in the general scheme of things, acquires\na moral character over time: <p>\nA classification system contains within it a series of restrictions and\nprivileges.  When no rigid classification system exists, these privileges\nthemselves become part of the timetable . . . How long is it before he is\nallowed two hour a day \"up time\" [out of bed]? . . . <i>these privileges are\ndesired not only in themselves, but for their symbolic value</i>.  They are\nsigns that the treatment is progressing, that the patient is getting closer to\ndischarge. (Roth, 1963, p.4) <p>\n<p>\n\tTimetable norms differ from hospital to hospital and from patient to patient.\nTrust, often in the form of moral condemnation or approval, may play a big part\nin structuring the timetable negotiations between doctor and patient.  For\nexample, alcoholic patients are often refused outside passes, or sometimes a\npatient with a \"recalcitrant attitude\" is refused a pass simply in order to\nconvince them that he or she really <i>is</i> very ill.  These moralizing\nattitudes, well documented within medical sociology, add another texture to the\nlandscape we are examining here, twisting it a little away from a simple\nformal-situated or realist-relativist axis.<p>\n\tDoctors as well as patients may hold the \"deserving\" attitude toward someone\nwho has \"served their time.\"  Roth notes that in treatment conferences, how\nlong the patient has been confined is always taken into account in deciding the\ntimetable, \"this in itself is given considerable weight entirely aside from the\nbacteriological and X-ray data.\" (1963, p.27) Even those who seem to be getting\nbetter much faster according to these tests are kept in longer because, \"TB\njust isn't cured that fast.\" (p.27)<b></b><p>\n<b>\t</b>Patients know almost to the day when which privileges will arrive:\n\"This relative precision of the timetable results from the emphasis placed upon\nthe classification system by the staff, the consistency in the decisions of the\nphysician in charge, and the physician explicitness in telling the patients\nwhat they can expect in the future.\" (Roth, 1963, p. 7) <p>\nThere can be a \"failure to be promoted\" in severe cases, and the reaction to\nthis \"varies greatly among TB patients, just as among engineers some of the\nfailures are emotionally disorganized when they do not make the grade while\nothers accept their inferior position with relative equanimity.  Some patients\nregard a few days' delay as a tragedy.\" (Roth, 1963, p. 15) Bargains are made:\n\"Patients <i>are </i> sometimes given regular and frequent passes to induce\nthem to remain in the hospital.\" (p. 53)<p>\n\tUncertainty plays a big role in negotiations about classification in the\nhospital.  When a patient tries to guess their classification, and the\nphysician disagrees, \"In effect, the physician tries to get Jones to change his\ncriteria for grouping patients so that his categories will be closer to those\nof the physician.\" (Roth, 1963, p. 39)  The doctor will provide the patient\nwith examples of others like him or her, and relates details about other\nsimilar cases.  But the physician too is caught in a double bind: ethically he\nor she is not allowed to give <i>too</i> many details about others' cases.  The\ndoctor is thus reduced to vague generalizations like \"No two cases are alike.\"\n(ibid., p. 39)  for the patient, this contributes to the house-of-mirrors\neffect:<p>\nMost physicians . . . vary their approach from one patient to another according\nto their own judgment of what the patient can take . . . the physicians do not\nknow with any precision how long it will take the patient to reach a given\nlevel of control over his disease.  In order to allow themselves a freer hand\nin deciding what the best time is for the patient to leave the hospital, the\ndoctors try to avoid being pinned down to any precise estimates by the\npatients. (Roth, 1963, p.45 )<p>\n<p>\n\tThis twisting effect of these silences is especially clear where the norms\nabout timetables are also shifting, either due to changes in medical practice,\ntechnology, staff, or organizational change.  One patient in these circumstance\nsaid:    \" You never seem to get anywhere because people here don't pay too\nmuch attention to the classifications.  I've been here now since November and\nI'm still in Group 1.  My husband comes to visit me and looks at this tag and\nthinks I'm never going to get promoted.  He wonders what's going on.  Then when\nyou <i>do </i> get promoted to Group 2, you don't know what it means, anyway.\nYou have no idea what additional privileges you have . . . <i>It's like an\nungraded school room</i>. \" (Roth, 1963, p.10) <p>\n\tThe ungraded schoolroom, combined with uncertainties, shifts in bureaucracy,\nand changes in the person's biography, begin to form the tapestry of a\nmonstrous existence.  <p>\n<u>Part 4. Borderlands and Monsters:  Time's Torquing of Standards and\nExperience</u><p>\n\t<i>Greta Garbo as Camille drifts across the screen in a cloud of white\norganza.</i><a href=\"tb_fn.html#fn3\">[8]</a><i>  She is alternately cruel and\nflirtatious, vulnerable and powerful.  She plays with the affections of her\nlovers, a baron and a struggling young diplomat, from her position as a farm\ngirl who came to Paris.  Early in the movie, we understand that she has been\nill; from time to time she discreetly covers her mouth with a handkerchief, or\nseems to swoon (always artistically). At times she recovers, and in a rhythm\ncomplexly played out against her wardrobe, she moves from white to black in\ndress, from sick to well, from powerful to powerless, from country to city.  As\nthe movie progresses she becomes more and more ill, and more and more \"pure\" --\nthinner, whiter, more in love with the worthy poor man and less with the\nnefarious rich Baron.  During the whole course of the movie, no one speaks the\nname of her illness, any prognosis or diagnosis, nor do we see any blood,\nsputum, feces, or other despoiling of the purified background.  Of course, she\nhas tuberculosis -- and she is the ideal type, the shadow puppet against which\nboth the medical story and the rich cultural criticisms of TB have been played\nout. </i><p>\n<i>There were those who/wanted to make him \"healthy,\" to make him \"go back to\nnature,\" when, the truth was, he had never been \"natural.\"</i> (Mann, 1929,\np.482)<p>\n<p>\n\tOn the magic mountain, or in any of the hospitals analyzed by Roth,  the sense\nof unreality, of being outside of \"normal\" time and of making up an\nidiosyncratic timing is very strong.  Furthermore, the very insides and\noutsides of people become mixed up in an almost monstrous way; Hans carries\naround his love Clavdia's x-ray in his breast pocket so that he may really know\nher.  External time drops away as does one's biography: <p>\n<p>\n(The inhabitants) accorded to the anniversary of arrival no other attention\nthan that of a profound silence . . . They set store by a proper articulation\nof the time, they gave heed to the calendar, observed the turning-points of the\nyear, its recurrent limits.  But to measure one's own private time, that time\nwhich for the individual in these parts was so closely bound up with space --\nthat was held to be an occupation only fit for new arrivals and short-termers.\nThe settled citizens preferred the unmeasured, the eternal, the day that was\nfor ever the same.  (Mann, 1929, p.427)<p>\n<p>\n\tThis sense of time begins to blur important distinctions between life and\ndeath, time and space:  \"But is not this affirmation of the eternal and the\ninfinite the logical -mathematical destruction of every and any limit in time\nor space, and the reduction of them, more or less, to zero?  is it possible, in\neternity, to conceive of a sequences of events, or in the infinite of a\nsuccession of space-occupying bodies? \" (Mann, 1929, p.356)  As we approach the\nzero point in the story, Mann notes in an afterword that time-space relations\nare shifted so that: \"the story practices a hermetical magic, a temporal\ndistortion of perspective reminding one of certain abnormal and transcendental\nexperiences in actual life.\" (p. 561) In the following section we offer a model\nfor how such a monstrous borderland terrain is constructed.<p>\n\t<u>4.1 Trajectories and twists:  The texture of action</u><p>\n<i>No one can ever know for certain just when tuberculosis become active or\nwhen it becomes inactive. For that matter, one can never be certain that the\ndisease is inactive, and a patient could logically be kept in the hospital for\nthe rest of his life on the assumption hat some slight undetectable changes\nmight be occurring in his lungs.</i> (Roth, 1963, p.30) <p>\n<p>\n<i>The same train brought them as had Hans Castorp, when years ago, years that\nhad been neither long nor short, but timeless, very eventful yet \"the sum of\nnothing,\" he had first come to this place.</i> (Mann, 1929, p.520)<p>\n<p>\n<i>\t</i>The model developed below has three parts (note that these are<i>\nnot</i> stages).  The original work of Corbin and Strauss was elaborated by\nTimmermans, and in this paper, we add to both of them.  They are thus parts of\nan ongoing conversation between all these authors. (For simplicity of\nrepresentation, time,  in the diagrams below appears to be a linear unfolding\nalong the x-axis.  Clearly, we are arguing against this simple \"unfolding\"\ntemporal structure; our own limits on drawing prevent a more complex\nrepresentation, which would probably resemble a weaving-in-motion in at least 4\ndimensions!)<p>\n\t<u>4.1.1 Body-Biography Trajectory:  Corbin and Strauss</u>\t<p>\n\tA model developed by Juliet Corbin and Anselm Strauss describes what happens\nin the course of a chronic illness (1988, 1991).  They posit that bodies and\nbiographies unfold along two intertwined trajectories (the \"body-biography\nchain\"), nestled in a matrix of other structural and interactional conditions\n(Strauss, 1993).  For example,  a heart attack may temporarily interrupt work,\nhome life, creativity, dragging \"down\" the trajectory of biography -- of\ncourse, this in turn is contingent on a number of other circumstances such as\nhaving access to health care, living in a war zone, having another illness\nwhich makes recovery longer.  The chain can be viewed geometrically,  as a\ntopography emerging from the interplays of these factors.  Many illnesses do\nnot have such an acute nature; during a long chronic illness there is a\nback-and-forth \"tugging\" across the trajectory of the disease/body and of the\nperson's biography, within the conditional matrix.  The title of Kathy Charmaz'\n<i>Good Days, Bad Days:  Time and Self in Chronic Illness </i>throws this\nrelation into relief (1991).  A long, slow downswing may only very gradually\naffect biography; a brief acute phase, experienced over and over, may be\ncompensated for by the person's and family's resources, so that the overall\ntrajectory of the biography remains fairly smooth.  Many possible shapes are\nenvisioned:  a looping shape in the case of a \"comeback\" after a serious,\ndebilitating illness; a very, very gradual progress of the disease which slowly\nerodes the biographical trajectory.     <p>\n\tThis model does not seek a Cartesian \"mind-body\" dualism, but rather to find a\nlanguage for the ways in which two (or more) different processes become\ninextricably intertwined into one thick chain or braid.  It makes more complex\nthe sick-well, able-disabled dichotomies, and brings in people's active\nconversations with and work with their ill bodies as a central concern. <p>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<p>\nInsert Figure 1 Here<p>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<p>\n\tThe body's trajectory and the self's are bound together, but not completely\ntightly coupled.  Careers, plans, work, and relationships may continue in spite\nof, around, and through illness; or, a sudden illness may interrupt plans and\nbiography and reshape the topography.   The background \"landscape\" is a nested\nset of contingent possibilities and structural features which in turn act upon\nthe shape of the trajectory.  Here, the solid line represents the trajectory of\nthe body, as it follows up and down the course of a disease and recovery.  The\ndotted line represents the person's biography, which is \"pulled\" and \"pushed\"\nmetaphorically by the body, but is not necessarily wholly determined by it\n(Corbin &amp; Strauss, 1988; 1991)<p>\n\t<u>4.1.2 Multiple identities along a body-biography trajectory in sudden\nillness or </u>\t\t\t<u>death</u><p>\n<u></u>\tTimmermans (in press; 1995), in a dialogue with the Corbin/Strauss BBC\nmodel,  suggests emphasizing multiple identities rather than a single\nbiographical identity.  He studied more than 100 cases of attempted\nresuscitations (CPR) with victims of cardiac arrest, in the emergency rooms of\nhospitals.  He attempted to use the trajectory model to explain the sequence\nand flow of events as people were brought in by the ambulance crews, \"worked\non\" by staff, and either declared dead or saved.  (The vast majority of people\ndie.)  In this extreme case of the interaction between body and biography, he\nobserved an interested elaboration of the relationship by focusing on the\nmultiple biographies all people do have.   <p>\n\tMany have noted that no individual is unitary; we are all multiple selves\n(Star, 1991).  Timmermans notes, along these lines, that each patient who\nundergoes CPR has multiple intertwining identities outside that of \"heart\nattach victim,\" each with its own trajectory. A single patient is at once\nfather, farmer, church member, student, and president of the Rotary Club.  Each\nof those selves has its own trajectory, which while intertwined, are also\nhistorically independent.   During the moments of resuscitation attempt,  these\nmultiple selves collapse into a single identity: that of the body/machine\n(Timmermans, in press).  That is, the nurses and doctors and technicians focus\ndown, relating only to the body aspect of the person, and collapsing all of the\npotential selves and identities of the person into one.  <p>\n\tAfter resuscitation (whether or not this is successful) the multiple\nidentities restart.  The body is again accompanied by the other selves, and the\nfather, farmer, etc. returns.  On return, each identity will have been\ndifferentially altered by the experience -- perhaps the farmer can no longer\nfarm -- yet the person is the same person.  In Timmermans' terms, there has\nbeen an isomorphic transformation.<p>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<p>\nInsert Figure 2 Here<p>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<p>\n\tTimmermans' modifications to the trajectory model in acute, severe illness\n(cardiac failure) are pictured above.  Here the biographical trajectories,\nselves, move from complex, multiple activity to a single focus:  life-saving.\nAt death, the identities are restored.  If the patient survives, they are the\nsame -- but different:  an <i>isomorphic transformation </i> (Timmermans, in\npress). <b></b><p>\n<b>\t</b><u>4.1.3 The twisted landscape:  Adding texture to multiplicity and\nstandardization</u><p>\n<u></u>\tIn this paper, we have added a third trajectory  dimension to play off\nagainst the interacting trajectories of bodies and multiple identities: the\ntrajectory of classification systems (as part of infrastructure).  In looking\nat an extreme case temporally - where the \"time\" of the body and of the\nmultiple identities cannot be aligned with the \"time\" of the classification\nsystem, we have suggested that the latter gets twisted by the former.  In the\ncase of TB,  a variety of monstrous classification schemes bubble through the\nrift in space/time.  There are mismatches between lived experience and the\nrigidities of institutionalized classifications; there are struggles and\nnegotiations between doctor and patient which are situated and which may seem\nerratic. For the patients, they have a chronic illness which necessitates\nwithdrawal for a prolonged period from \"normal life,\" sequestering with others\nwith the disease, in an uncertain time frame that is partly dependent on the\nways classification schemes are perceived, negotiated, and used by health\npersonnel.  As with the models of Corbin, Strauss and Timmermans, our model\ndraws on a matrix of possibilities for the basis for these negotiations.  These\nare culturally and historically specific, and include such factors as how\nmedical knowledge is represented by public health agencies, how classifications\nare modified during the hospital stay, and images from literature, film and\npopular science about \"what people with tuberculosis are like.\"   The rich\ntopography of body and biography intercalates with a\nbureaucratic/infrastructural typology (classification scheme). <p>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<p>\nInsert Figure 3 here<p>\n--------------------------------------------------------------<p>\n\tThe twisted landscape of multiple identities and classifications is pictured\nabove.  In the torqued model, the thick solid line represents the\ninstitutionalized classification schemes; these get modified and \"broken\" more\nslowly than the timeline of the patients' bodies or biographies.  There is\nstill a body trajectory, indicated by the thinner solid line, which classically\nmoves up and down over time, during the long course of the disease.  Finally,\nafter Timmermans, we have multiple biographical trajectories -- patients are\nstruck with the disease as they are progressing in studies, family raising,\nlove affairs, careers, and so on.  Unlike the Timmermans model, the long years\npassed \"out of time\" may fracture these identities and transform them beyond\nfamiliarity -- another echo of a \"monstrous\" or distorted sense of the\ndisease.<p>\n\tThe topology created by the body-biography trajectory is pulled against the\nidealized, standardized typology of the global classification of tuberculosis\n-- itself a broken and moving target.<a href=\"tb_fn.html#fn4\">[9]</a>  When\nstandard classifications are added to the scheme, patients try to fit their\nexperiences along both body and biographical trajectories to a standard picture\nor metric.  changing definitions, local arrangements, and complex relations of\nall three trajectories contribute to \"torquing\"; this may be amplified by\nunsuccessful negotiations.<u>Conclusion. Twists and Textures:  Classification\nand Lived Experience</u><p>\n<b></b><p>\n<b></b><i>\"Time morality is not cut and dried.\"</i> (Condon &amp;\nSchweingruber, 1994, p. 63 of MS)<p>\n<p>\n\tThe information infrastructure that deals with tuberculosis, as with other\ndiseases, operationalizes a classification system that does not cope well with\nthe subtleties of biographical time, experience, or negotiations about reality.\nIt often uses spatial coordinates:   the disease as localized in this body or\nnot; in this region of the body and no other; it is present among this\npopulation but not that one; the cure can be found in this place but not that\nand so forth.  The closest that one gets to the flow of time is the description\nactive or passive, latent or virulent; occasionally, in links with rough life\nstages such as geriatric or pediatric.  But this describes an information\ninfrastructure dealing with medical knowledge - a knowledge that defines itself\nas being true \"for all time\" about its subject and so able to abstract\ncontingent historical and biographical flow to uncover the underlying\nreality.<p>\n\tHowever, there is not just one kind of classification in the world:\nclassification work is always multiple.  As we get further from medical\nknowledge and closer to the suffering patient, time seeps into the\nclassification systems that get used: how long does Group 1 stay here ? (Roth)\n; How may I get reclassified so that I can pass more (or less) time on the\nmagic mountain? (Mann).   Camille's morality tale unfolds in time in binary\noppositions of good/bad, fit/ill, black/white; promotion or demotion from class\nto class in a continually downwards career trajectory.  Tuberculosis is the\narchetypal disease of time: chronic, recurrent, progressive.<p>\n\tSo what happens when the disease of time meets the classification of space?\nAs we have shown, the formal, spatial classification twists.  \"Other\"\ncategories run rampant, each seeking a way of expressing the elusive, forbidden\nflow of time (words like \"quiescent\" and \"non-active\" abound).  A macabre\nlandscape is born.   And the historiography of the classification system twists\nback on itself: in stunning contrast to most medical scientific texts,\ntuberculosis classifiers speak of a cyclical flow to their own historical time\n(not linear progress).  From the other point of view, that of the patient,\northogonal classifications are developed that do not even interact with medical\ncategories (\"I have put in my time here, and I am a good person, so I deserve\nto be better and to leave.\")   The individual's disease is given a temporal\ntexture at the price of becoming purely local - abstracted <i>away from</i> the\nstandardized language it becomes once again temporally textured and\nimmediate.<p>\n\tThis way of framing the problem introduces the idea of <i>texture</i> as an\nimportant one in the representations-work-body-biography literature emerging\nfrom both social studies of science and cultural/historical psychology. Lynch's\nwork on topical contextures implies a similar direction, we think:  the look\nand feel of being in a place and using a genre of representations (1995).  Kari\nThoresen (personal communication), a former geologist,  is developing a model\nand vocabulary for different aspects of texture in organizations and\ntechnological networks, examining layers and strata, crystallization processes\n(a term also used by Strauss and Timmermans), and other metaphors to examine\nhow wires, people and bits are put together by a large organization. \t<p>\n\tWhy should social scientists be interested in such twists?  We have suggested\nthat as we can move on from exploring the seamless web of science and society,\nof nature and knowledge to an analysis of the information infrastructure that\nacts as matrix for the web.  The web itself is textured in interesting ways by\nthe available modes of information storage and transfer.  Medical\nclassification work, typified by the ICD, deals in primarily spatial\ncompartments; and these compartments cannot hold when biography and duration is\na necessary part of the story.  In general, the information infrastructure\nholds certain kinds of knowledge and supports certain varieties of network; and\nwe believe that it is a task of some urgency for our field to analyze which\nkinds of knowledge and network. We have also heard echoes throughout this\nresearch of the ways it is for those living with and researching AIDS (Epstein,\n1995), and hope to add to the rich analysis of AIDS, experience, activism and\nresearch currently taking shape in our field. As well, the notion of activity\ntheoretic spaces with development proceeding dialectically between individual,\ncommunity, and the mediations of material artifacts may be augmented by these\nnotions of texture (cf. Engestr&ouml;m, 1987). The zone of proximal\ndevelopment, and the contradictions posed by mismatches between individual\nexperience and institutional mores, may have some of the textural qualities we\ndiscuss here.  Under some conditions (of silence, of denial of experiential\nvalidity, of delayed answers or justice), the sense of torquing could be quite\nan important quality.  We need ways to understand experience which seems\nmonstrous, or out of place, or \"queer\" (in the negative sense). We are reminded\nhere of Michel Serres' (1980) invocation of the passage between the natural and\nhumanistic sciences as indeterminate, twisted, and full of ice floes; of the\nimages of cyborg and monster pervading feminist theory about technology\n(Haraway, 1992; Casper, 1994a, 1994b, 1995). <p>\n\tMuch of our previous work (Bowker &amp; Star, 1991; 1994; Star, 1991) has\nconcerned itself with the relationship (which we first conceptualized as a kind\nof gap) between formal systems of knowledge representation and informal,\nexperiential, empirical, and situated experience.  Berg (in press) has shown\nconvincingly that it is never the case of \"the map OR the territory,\" but\nalways, using the example of medical protocols, \"the map IN the territory.\"\nThis is a modest attempt to look at one kind of map in a territory marked by\nsevere biographical interruptions, solitude and aspects of total institutions,\nand in dialogue with a compelling infrastructure (both informatic and\nmanagerial).  We see the map-actant in this case as a warping factor, not in\nthe sense of deviating from any putative norm,  but in the sense of reshaping\nand constraining other kinds of experience.<b> </b><u>Note</u><b></b><p>\n<b></b>Correspondence regarding this article should be sent to Leigh Star or\nGeoffrey C.
