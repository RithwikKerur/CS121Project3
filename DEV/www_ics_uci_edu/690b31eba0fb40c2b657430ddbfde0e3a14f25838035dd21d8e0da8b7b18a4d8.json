Atallah, Michael T. Goodrich, and Roberto Tamassia,\nin submission.\n<p>\nThe authors introduce data structure forensics -- techniques for\ndistributing data structures, so that alterations from an original\nversion can be detected and specifically identified. They provide a\nnew reduced randomness construction for nonadaptive combinatorial\ngroup testing, such that for a reasonable\nd=o(n<sup>1/3</sup><r>log</r><sup>2/3</sup>n),\nonly o(n) bits of storage is needed to detect up to d\nalterations.\nThen they show that the o(n) bits can be encoded into the\narchitecture for a class of data structures including binary search\ntrees, skip lists, arrays, linked lists and hash tables. This solution\nuses no storage (except a master key) at the auditor, and adds (not\nasymptotically but exactly) no storage to the data structure. The\nadversary doesn't even know if the data structure is under auditing.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
