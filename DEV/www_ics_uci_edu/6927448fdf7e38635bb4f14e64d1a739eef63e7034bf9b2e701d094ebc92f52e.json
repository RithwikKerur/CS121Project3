We consider\nthe problem of computing, for each edge e on P , the length\nof a shortest path in G from s to t that avoids e. This is\nknown as the replacement paths problem. We give a linear-\nspace algorithm with O(n log n) running time for n-vertex\nplanar directed graphs. The previous best time bound was\nO(n log<sup>2</sup> n).\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
