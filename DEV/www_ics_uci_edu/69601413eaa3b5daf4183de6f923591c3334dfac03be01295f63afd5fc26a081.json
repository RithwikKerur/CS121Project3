Even if utterly new recording procedures do not\nappear, these present ones are certainly in the process of\nmodification and extension.\n\n<p>\n\nCertainly progress in photography is not going to stop.  Faster\nmaterial and lenses, more automatic cameras, finer-grained sensitive\ncompounds to allow an extension of the minicamera idea, are all\nimminent.  Let us project this trend ahead to a logical, if not\ninevitable, outcome.  The camera hound of the future wears on his\nforehead a lump a little larger than a walnut.  It takes pictures 3\nmillimeters square, later to be projected or enlarged, which after all\ninvolves only a factor of 10 beyond present practice.  The lens is of\nuniversal focus, down to any distance accommodated by the unaided eye,\nsimply because it is of short focal length.  There is a built-in\nphotocell on the walnut such as we now have on at least one camera,\nwhich automatically adjusts exposure for a wide range of illumination.\nThere is film in the walnut for a hundred exposure, and the spring for\noperating its shutter and shifting its film is wound once for all when\nthe film clip is inserted.  It produces its result in full color.  It\nmay well be stereoscopic, and record with spaced glass eyes, for\nstriking improvements in stereoscopic technique are just around the\ncorner.\n\n<p>\n\nThe cord which trips its shutter may reach down a man's sleeve within\neasy reach of his fingers.  A quick squeeze, and the picture is taken.\nOn a pair of ordinary glasses is a square of fine lines near the top\nof one lens, where it is out of the way of ordinary vision.  When an\nobject appears in that square, it is lined up for its picture.  As the\nscientist of the future moves about the laboratory or the field, every\ntime he looks at something worthy of the record, he trips the shutter\nand in it goes, without even an audible click.  Is this all fantastic?\nThe only fantastic thing about it is the idea of making as many\npictures as would result from its use.\n\n<p>\n\nWill there be dry photography?  It is already here in two forms.  When\nBrady made his Civil War pictures, the plate had to be wet at the time\nof exposure.  Now it has to be wet during development instead.  In the\nfuture perhaps it need not be wetted at all.  There have long been\nfilms impregnated with <a\nhref=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?diazo\">diazo</a> dyes\nwhich form a picture without development, so that it is already there\nas soon as the camera has been operated.  An exposure to ammonia gas\ndestroys the unexposed dye, and the picture can then be taken out into\nthe light and examined.  The process is now slow, but someone may\nspeed it up, and it has no grain difficulties such as now keep\nphotographic researchers busy.  Often it would be advantageous to be\nable to snap the camera and to look at the picture immediately.\n\n<p>\n\nAnother process now is use is also slow, and more or less clumsy.  For\nfifty years impregnated papers have been used which turn dark at every\npoint where an electrical contact touches them, by reason of the\nchemical change thus produced in an iodine compound included in the\npaper.  They have been used to make records, for a pointer moving\nacross them can leave a trail behind.  If the electrical potential on\nthe pointer is varied as it moves, the line becomes light or dark in\naccordance with the potential.\n\n<p>\n\nThis scheme is now used in facsimile transmission.  The pointer draws\na set of closely spaced lines across the paper one after another.  As\nit moves, its potential is varied in accordance with a varying current\nreceived over wires from a distant station, where these variations are\nproduced by a photocell which is similarly scanning a picture.  At\nevery instant the darkness of the line being drawn is made equal to\nthe darkness of the point on the picture being observed by the\nphotocell.  Thus, when the whole picture has been covered, a replica\nappears at the receiving end.\n\n<p>\n\nA scene itself can be just as well looked over line by line by the\nphotocell in this way as can a photograph of the scene.  This whole\napparatus constitutes a camera, with the added feature, which can be\ndispensed with if desired, of making its picture at a distance.  It is\nslow, and the picture is poor in detail.  Still, it does give another\nprocess of dry photography, in which the picture is finished as soon\nas it is taken.\n\n<p>\n\nIt would be a brave man who could predict that such a process will\nalways remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail.  Television\nequipment today transmits sixteen reasonably good images a second, and\nit involves only two essential differences from the process described\nabove.  For one, the record is made by a moving beam of electrons\nrather than a moving pointer, for the reason that an electron beam can\nsweep across the picture very rapidly indeed.  The other difference\ninvolves merely the use of a screen which glows momentarily when the\nelectrons hit, rather than a chemically treated paper or film which is\npermanently altered.  This speed is necessary in television, for\nmotion pictures rather than stills are the object.\n\n<p>\n\nUse chemically treated film in place of the glowing screen, allow the\napparatus to transmit one picture rather than a succession, and a\nrapid camera for dry photography results.  The treated film needs to\nbe far faster in action than present examples, but it probably could\nbe.  More serious is the objection that this scheme would involve\nputting the film inside a vacuum chamber, for electron beams behave\nnormally only in such a rarefied environment.  This difficulty could\nbe avoided by allowing the electron beam to play on one side of a\npartition, and by pressing the film against the other side, if this\npartition were such as to allow the electrons to go through\nperpendicular to its surface, and to prevent them from spreading out\nsideways.  Such partitions, in crude form, could certainly be\nconstructed, and they will hardly hold up the general development.\n\n<p>\n\nLike dry photography, microphotography still has a long way to go.\nThe basic scheme of reducing the size of the record, and examining it\nby projection rather than directly, has possibilities too great to be\nignored.  The combination of optical projection and photographic\nreduction is already producing some results in microfilm for scholarly\npurposes, and the potentialities are highly suggestive.  Today, with\nmicrofilm, reductions by a linear factor of 20 can be employed and\nstill produce full clarity when the material is re-enlarged for\nexamination.  The limits are set by the graininess of the film, the\nexcellence of the optical system, and the efficiency of the light\nsources employed.  All of these are rapidly improving.\n\n<p>\n\nAssume a linear ratio of 100 for future use.  Consider film of the\nsame thickness as paper, although thinner film will certainly be\nusable.  Even under these conditions there would be a total factor of\n10,000 between the bulk of the ordinary record on books, and its\nmicrofilm replica.  The <a href=\"http://www.eb.com/\"><i>Encyclopoedia\nBritannica</i></a> could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox.  A\nlibrary of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a\ndesk.  If the human race has produced since the invention of movable\ntype a total record, in the form of magazines, newspapers, books,\ntracts, advertising blurbs, correspondence, having a volume\ncorresponding to a billion books, the whole affair, assembled and\ncompressed, could be lugged off in a moving van.  Mere compression, of\ncourse, is not enough; one needs not only to make and store a record\nbut also to be able to consult it, and this aspect of the matter comes\nlater.  Even the modern great library is not generally consulted; it is\nnibbled by a few.\n\n<p>\n\nCompression is important, however, when it comes to costs.  The\nmaterial for the microfilm <i>Britannica</i> would cost a nickel, and\nit could be mailed anywhere for a cent.  What would it cost to print a\nmillion copies?  To print a sheet of newspaper, in a large edition,\ncosts a small fraction of a cent.  The entire material of the\n<i>Britannica</i> in reduced microfilm form would go on a sheet eight\nand one-half by eleven inches.  Once it is available, with the\nphotographic reproduction methods of the future, duplicates in large\nquantities could probably be turned out for a cent apiece beyond the\ncost of materials.  The preparation of the original copy?  That\nintroduces the next aspect of the subject.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Next:</b> <a href=\"section3.html\">Section 3</a>,\n<b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"section1.html\">Section 1</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
