In particular, we are interested in how computer\nsystems can be made to work more effectively in a range of\nsettings, and how they can be designed to support the needs of\nindividuals and groups. Topics of research include user interface\ndesign, collaborative work,\nthe sociology of information, medical informatics, mobile work,\ncomputer-mediated communication,\nsocial informatics,\ninfrastructures for interaction and collaboration, and\norganisational information systems design.\n\n<p>\nWe carry out this work by conducting long-term ethnographic\ninvestigations of working settings and technology use, and by\ndesigning and developing\nprototype technologies and subjecting them to both experimental and\nlong-term in situ evaluation.\n\n<p>\nUnder its former name, CORPS, ICT\nwas founded in 1973, by\n<a target=_top href=http://www.slis.indiana.edu/kling>Rob Kling</a>.\nWe have strong links to other groups on campus, including the\n<a target=_top href=http://www.isr.uci.edu>Institute for Software Research</a>,\nthe\n<a target=_top href=http://www.crito.uci.edu>\nCenter for Research on Information Technology and Organizations</a>,\nand the\n<a target=_top href=http://www.gsm.uci.edu>Graduate School of Management</a>.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
