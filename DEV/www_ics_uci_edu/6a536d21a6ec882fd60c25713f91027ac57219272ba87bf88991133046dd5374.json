Taylor, Nenad Medvidovic, Kenneth M. Anderson,\nE. James Whitehead Jr., Jason E. Robbins, Kari A. Nies, Peyman Oreizy,\nand Deborah L. Dubrow, <i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i>,\nvol. 22, no. 6, pages 390-406, June 1996.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nWhile a large fraction of application code is devoted to graphical user \ninterface (GUI) functions, support for reuse in this domain has largely \nbeen confined to the creation of GUI toolkits <i>widgets</i>. We present \na novel architectural style directed at supporting larger grain reuse \nand flexible system composition. Moreover, the style supports design of \ndistributed, concurrent applications. Asynchronous notification messages and \nasynchronous request messages are the sole basis for inter-component \ncommunication. A key aspect of the style is that components are not built \nwith any dependencies on what typically would be considered lower-level \ncomponents, such as user interface toolkits. Indeed, all components are \noblivious to the existence of any components to which notification messages \nare sent. While our focus has been on applications involving graphical \nuser interfaces, the style has the potential for broader applicability. \nSeveral trial applications using the style are described\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Tue May 23 13:40:23 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
