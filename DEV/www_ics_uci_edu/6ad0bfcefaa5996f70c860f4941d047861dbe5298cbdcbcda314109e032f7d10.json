And if\nwe're going to do this, I'd prefer to see something like:\n\n   <a href=\"http://host/dir/projectX/Macintosh;version=1.5/French/file.c\">http://host/dir/projectX/Macintosh;version=1.5/French/file.c</a>\n\nThis still handles the \"surfing\" requirement that seems to be so compelling.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;| 2)  Competing name space semantics: What gives us the right to partition\n&gt;| the name space for HTTP servers which employ versioning?  How can we\n&gt;\n&gt;We're not seizing rights here, we're establishing a convention.\n&gt;Admittedly, even /version=_version_/ takes away from the namespace\n&gt;freedom of the HTTP servers, albeit less than simply /_version_/.\n\nThis dodges my main point: how can we guarantee there won't be collisions\nbetween our convention, and other existing conventions.  Given the scope of\nthe proposed convention, I find the likelihood of collisions to be high,\nand gave an example of an entire class of existing namespaces which may\ncause problems.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;| 4) The main benefit of placing version identifiers into the name space,\n&gt;| \"surfing\" into the past via relative URLs, does not work.  One scenario\n&gt;| outlines this:\n&gt;|\n&gt;| <a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/1.5/A.html\">http://foo.bar.com/1.5/A.html</a>  (where 1.5 is the version id) contains a\n&gt;| relative URL of GIF \"../background.gif.\"  In this case, version 1.5 of\n&gt;| background.gif would also be retrieved.  However, experience to date with\n&gt;| versioning systems shows that all objects are not versioned at the same\n&gt;| rate.\n&gt;\n&gt;First, if the _version_ identifier is something other than a revision\n&gt;number, this works a whole lot better:\n&gt;\n&gt;        <a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/brochure/version=_symbolic-label_/A.html\">http://foo.bar.com/brochure/version=_symbolic-label_/A.html</a>\n&gt;\n&gt;allows A.html to include a relative gif of \"background.gif\" and get the\n&gt;desired version, whatever its revision number may be.\n&gt;\n&gt;Second, if you allow /version=_version_/ to appear anywhere in the path,\n&gt;then the aware server can have it where it most makes sense.  For example,\n&gt;\n&gt;        <a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/brochure/A.html/version=1.15\">http://foo.bar.com/brochure/A.html/version=1.15</a>\n&gt;\n\nI don't think you can just allow /version=_version_/ to appear either\nbefore or after the resource without affecting the semantics of it.  The\nway I read your comments, having the /version=_version_/ before the\nresource is giving the version id of a *collection* of resources, while\nhaving /version=_version_/ after the resource is simply specifying the\nversion id of the resource itself.  These are not the same.\n\nPlus, I still don't think this works.  Here's another example:\n\nresource A.html has 3 versions: A.html,1.0; A.html,2.0; A.html;2.1\nresource B.html has 2 versions: B.html,1.0; B.html,2.0\nresource logo.gif has 2 versions: logo.gif,1.0; logo.gif,2.0\n\nThe latest version of resource A.html is version 2.1, and includes version\n2.0 of logo.gif using a relative URL.  The latest version of resource\nB.hmtl is version 2.0, which also includes version 2.0 of logo.gif using a\nrelative URL.\n\nTo make the name space work, you'd have:\n\n<a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/A.html\">http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/A.html</a>\n<a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.0/B.html\">http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.0/B.html</a>\n\nBut wait ... the relative URL in A.html will try to get the 2.1 version of\nlogo.gif, which doesn't exist!  Assuming you mean that the version=2.1\nreally refers to a collection of resources, I'll assume you can add a\nsymbolic link to version 2.0 of logo.gif into the version=2.1 collection.\nAt this point, let me introduce resource C.html, which, like A.html, has\nthree versions, 1.0, 2.0 and 2.1.  As you might imagine, C.html also\nincludes logo.gif, but C.html is an older page which has not been updated\nrecently, and hence includes logo.gif version 1.0. So the URL for C.html\nis:\n\n<a href=\"http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/C.html\">http://foo.bar.com/top/version=2.1/C.html</a>\n\nUtilizing the solution of adding a symbolic link to logo.gif, version 1.0\ninto collection \"version=2.1\", we suddenly realize that a symbolic link to\nlogo.gif already exists (left over from adding the link to version 2.0 of\nlogo.gif for A.html version 2.1).  This is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if the versions (i.e.,\n..../version=_version_/resource.html) do not actually refer to collections,\nbut instead refer just to the object one heirarchy down, then there are\nstill problems.  A new version 2.1 of logo.gif, a copy of version 2.0,\ncould be made so that A.html would retrieve the right version, but C.html,\nversion 2.1 just simply would be unable to get version 1.0 of logo.gif,\nbecause the version 2.1 name for logo.gif has already been taken by a copy\nof version 2.0 of logo.gif.\n\n&gt;The whole point is to allow version-naive clients to surf.  If this is not\n&gt;as important as I think it is, then maybe we don't need to go to such lengths\n&gt;to solve the problem.\n\nI think it is an important problem.  But I also think we shouldn't\npartition the namespace in a way which causes other problems due to\nnamespace collisions, and restrictions on the versions of entities which\nmay be accessed.\n\nI strongly feel the text/config MIME type approach is the best one for\nhandling browsing of collections of versioned objects.\n\n- Jim\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0088.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0086.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe in reply to:</b> <a href=\"0083.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next in thread:</b> <a href=\"0088.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Re: Name space munging ... blech!\"</a>\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
