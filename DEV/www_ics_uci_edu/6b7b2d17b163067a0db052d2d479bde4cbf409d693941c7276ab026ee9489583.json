They show that even with full knowledge of the\nset of bidders' private valuations for the items, if the bidders are\nex-ante identical, no ascending auction can extract more than a\nconstant times the revenue of the best fixed price scheme.\n<P>\nThis problem is equivalent to the problem of coming up with an optimal\nstrategy for blowing up indistinguishable balloons with known\ncapacities in order to maximize the amount of contained air. They show\nthat the algorithm which simply inflates all balloons to a fixed\nvolume is close to optimal in this setting.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
