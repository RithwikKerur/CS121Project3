Many\napplications of interval graphs also generalize to multiple-interval graphs,\noften allowing for more robustness in the modeling of the specific\napplication. With this motivation in mind, a recent systematic study of\noptimization problems in multiple-interval graphs was initiated. In this\nsequel, we study multiple-interval graph problems from the perspective of\nparameterized complexity. The problems under consideration are k-Independent\nSet, k-Dominating Set, and kClique, which are all known to be W[1]-hard for\ngeneral graphs, and NP-complete for multiple-interval graphs. We prove that\nk-Clique is in FPT, while k-Independent Set and k-Dominating Set are both\nW[1]-hard. We also prove that k-Independent Dominating Set, a hybrid of the\ntwo above problems, is also W[1]-hard. Our hardness results hold even when\neach vertex is associated with at most two intervals, and all intervals have\nunit length. Furthermore, as an interesting byproduct of our hardness\nresults, we develop a useful technique for showing W[1]-hardness via a\nreduction from the k-Multicolored Clique problem, a variant of k-Clique. We\nbelieve this technique has interest in its own right, as it should help in\nsimplifying W[1]-hardness results which are notoriously hard to construct and\ntechnically tedious.\n\n<p>\n(Based on a paper by Michael Fellows, Danny Hermelinb, Frances Rosamonda,\nSt\u00c3\u00a9phane Vialette) \n<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2008.09.065\">\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2008.09.065</a>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "ISO-8859-1"}
