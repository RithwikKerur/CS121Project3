Examples of this\ninclude\n<a href=\"http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/topology/primes.top\">the\nexistence of infinitely many prime numbers</a>,\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060925091238/http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~rjc/etc/zeta2.dvi\">the evaluation of\nzeta(2)</a>,\nthe fundamental theorem of algebra (polynomials have roots), quadratic\nreciprocity (a formula for testing whether an arithmetic progression\ncontains a square) and the Pythagorean theorem (which according to\n<a href=\"refs.html#Wells\">Wells</a> has at least 367 proofs).\nThis also sometimes happens for unimportant theorems,\nsuch as the fact that in any rectangle dissected into smaller rectangles,\nif each smaller rectangle has integer width or height, so does the\nlarge one.</p>\n\n<p>This page lists proofs of the Euler formula:\nfor any convex polyhedron, the number of vertices and faces together\nis exactly two more than the number of edges.\nSymbolically V&minus;E+F=2.\nFor instance, a tetrahedron has four vertices, four faces, and six edges;\n4-6+4=2.</p>\n\n<p>A version of the formula dates over 100 years earlier than Euler, to Descartes in 1630. Descartes gives a discrete form of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, stating that the sum of the face angles of a polyhedron is 2&pi;(V&minus;2), from which he infers that the number of plane angles is 2F+2V-4. The number of plane angles is always twice the number of edges, so this is equivalent to Euler's formula, but later authors such as <A\nHREF=\"refs.html#Lak\">Lakatos</a>, <a href=\"refs.html#Mal\">Malkevitch</a>, and Polya disagree, feeling that the distinction between face angles and edges is too large for this to be viewed as the same formula. The formula V&minus;E+F=2 was (re)discovered by Euler; he wrote about it twice in 1750, and in 1752 <a href=\"refs.html#Eu\">published the result</a>, with a faulty proof by induction for triangulated polyhedra based on removing a vertex and retriangulating the hole formed by its removal. The retriangulation step does not necessarily preserve the convexity or planarity of the resulting shape, so the induction does not go through.\nAnother early attempt at a proof, by Meister in 1784, is essentially the <a href=\"triangle.html\">triangle removal proof</a> given here, but without justifying the existence of a triangle to remove.\nIn 1794, <a href=\"refs.html#Leg\">Legendre</a> provided a complete proof, using <a href=\"sphere.html\">spherical angles</a>.\nCauchy got into the act in 1811, citing Legendre and adding incomplete proofs based on triangle removal, <a href=\"ear.html\">ear decomposition</a>, and tetrahedron removal from a tetrahedralization of a partition of the polyhedron into smaller polyhedra.\n<a href=\"refs.html#HilPed\">Hilton and Pederson</a> provide more references\nas well as entertaining speculation on Euler's discovery of the formula. Confusingly, other equations such as <I>e</I><sup><I>i</I>&nbsp;pi</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1\nand <I>a</I><sup>phi(<I>n</I>)</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;<I>n</I>)\nalso go by the name of \"Euler's formula\"; Euler was a busy man.</p>\n\n<p>The polyhedron formula, of course, can be generalized in many important ways,\nsome using methods described below.\nOne important generalization is to planar graphs.\nTo form a planar graph from a polyhedron,\nplace a light source near one face of the polyhedron, and a plane on the other side.</p>\n\n<p align=center><img src=\"shadow.png\" width=350 height=301\nalt=\"shadow of a polyhedron\"></p>\n\n<p>The shadows of the polyhedron edges form a planar graph, embedded in\nsuch a way that the edges are straight line segments.\nThe faces of the polyhedron correspond to convex\npolygons that are faces of the embedding.  The face nearest the light\nsource corresponds to the outside face of the embedding, which is also\nconvex.  Conversely, any planar graph with certain connectivity\nproperties comes from a polyhedron in this way.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the proofs below use only the topology of the planar graph,\nsome use the geometry of its embedding, and some use the\nthree-dimensional geometry of the original polyhedron.\nGraphs in these proofs will not necessarily be <I>simple</I>:\nedges may connect a vertex to itself, and two vertices may be connected\nby multiple edges.  Several of the proofs rely on the Jordan curve\ntheorem, which itself has multiple proofs; however these are not\ngenerally based on Euler's formula so one can use Jordan curves without\nfear of circular reasoning.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"interdig.html\">\nProof 1: Interdigitating Trees\n</a><LI><a href=\"iface.html\">\nProof 2: Induction on Faces\n</a><LI><a href=\"ivertex.html\">\nProof 3: Induction on Vertices\n</a><LI><a href=\"iedge.html\">\nProof 4: Induction on Edges\n</a><LI><a href=\"d-n-c.html\">\nProof 5: Divide and Conquer\n</a><LI><a href=\"charges.html\">\nProof 6: Electrical Charge\n</a><LI><a href=\"dualcharge.html\">\nProof 7: Dual Electrical Charge\n</a><LI><a href=\"angle.html\">\nProof 8: Sum of Angles\n</a><LI><a href=\"sphere.html\">\nProof 9: Spherical Angles\n</a><LI><a href=\"pick.html\">\nProof 10: Pick's Theorem\n</a><LI><a href=\"ear.html\">\nProof 11: Ear Decomposition\n</a><LI><a href=\"shell.html\">\nProof 12: Shelling\n</a><LI><a href=\"triangle.html\">\nProof 13: Triangle Removal\n</a><LI><a href=\"noah.html\">\nProof 14: Noah's Ark\n</a><LI><a href=\"binary.html\">\nProof 15: Binary Homology\n</a><LI><a href=\"bsp.html\">\nProof 16: Binary Space Partition\n</a><LI><a href=\"val.html\">\nProof 17: Valuations\n</a><LI><a href=\"harr.html\">\nProof 18: Hyperplane Arrangements\n</a><LI><a href=\"ipe.html\">\nProof 19: Integer-Point Enumeration\n</a><LI><a href=\"euler.html\">\nProof 20: Euler tours\n</a>\n<LI><a href=\"all.html\">\nAll Proofs\n</a><LI><a href=\"refs.html\">\nReferences\n</a></UL>\n\nPlease <a href=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">send email</a>\nif you know of a proof not listed here.\nI would especially appreciate proofs involving cohomology theory,\ntoric varieties, or other higher mathematics.\n(Helena Verrill has shown that\n<a href=\"http://hverrill.net/pages~helena/toricpoly/toriceuler.html\">Euler's\nformula is equivalent to the fact that every toric variety over GF[p]\nhas a number of points equal to 1 (mod p)</a>\nbut is still missing a nice non-combinatorial proof of the latter fact.)\n\n<P>I imagine it would be possible to construct inductions\nbased on the representation of convex polyhedra as intersections\nof halfspaces or convex hulls of points, but the need to\nhandle inputs in non-general position would make the resulting\nproofs quite messy.\n<P>\nThere also seems to be a potential connection\nto binomials: if one defines a polynomial\np(t) = 1+Vt+Et<sup>2</sup>+Ft<sup>3</sup>+t<sup>4</sup>, the Euler\nformula can be interpreted\nas saying that p(t) is divisible by 1+t.\nBut for simplices of any dimension,\np(t)=(1+t)<sup>d+1</sup> by the binomial formula.\nPerhaps there is a proof of Euler's formula that uses\nthese polynomials directly rather than merely translating\none of the inductions into polynomial form.\n<a href=\"propp.html\">Jim Propp\nasks similar questions for infinite-dimensional polytopes</a>,\ninterpreting p(t) as a power series\n(see also <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0203289\">his recent\nexpansion of these ideas</a>).\n<P><HR><P>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
