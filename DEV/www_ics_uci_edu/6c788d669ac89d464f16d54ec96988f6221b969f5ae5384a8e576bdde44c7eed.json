You may audio tape lecture, provided only you, yourself, use it and only to study for this course.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><i>Go to the Help Center</i>; it&#146;s a great place to work with your partner, and where you can ask TAs and lab tutors about the assignments while you are working on them.</p></li>\n \n<li><p><i>Keep up with the reading;</i> you&#146;ll need the information it provides to do your assignments and exams, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed pages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#146;re not careful. But don&#146;t try to memorize everything the first time you read it through. A good strategy is to read for the broad ideas before lecture, listen to lecture carefully, and then refer back to the text for reference as needed.</li>\n\n<li><p><i>Start  working with your partner on the lab assignments early on; computer work always takes longer to complete than you think it will,</i> even if you have previous experience. You want to know each lab assignment&#146;s material <i>cold</i> before you take the lab exam that corresponds to it. All lab assignments are in the Lab Manual; to keep from getting behind, start each no later than the date given for it in the Course Schedule.</li>\n\n<li><p><i>Take each lab exam on the the day it is scheduled.</i> Not taking a exam when scheduled (wthout prior approval) is at minimum a hassle for you (and us!) and, at worst, will result in the equivalent of a permanent Not Pass score for the missed exam.</p></li>\n\n<li><p><i>Be very sure to label your lab exam submissions properly, and to have your name, ID number and UCInetID in the exam where indicated. When submitting evaluations, be sure to send them to the indicated email address.</i> We often cannot find exams that are placed into the wrong folder or improperly lableled;  we don&#146;t receive email sent to wrong addresses. We cannot score what we do not have; we cannot record a score for work when we cannot determine whose work it is. </li>\n\n<li><p><i>Let us know if one of your scores is wrong or missing.</i> If you do not see your score for an exam or evaluation you turned in when we post its scores, contact the TA (about lab exams) or the instructor (about the midterm and final). We&#146;ll work with you to determine what has happened. Often, a missing score means you did not turn in your work properly (see the previous bullet). If we can find the item, we&#146;ll score it; if we cannot, you&#146;ll need to contact the instructor to determine what can be done.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<h3>Announcements</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>During the quarter, important  announcements will be made in lecture; those of particular importance will also be posted to the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics21/Announcements.html\">Announcements Board</a>; check it often! </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<a name=\"#Java\"></a>\n<h3>Setting Up Java at Home</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Some students like to do their Java programming outside of the Help Center.
