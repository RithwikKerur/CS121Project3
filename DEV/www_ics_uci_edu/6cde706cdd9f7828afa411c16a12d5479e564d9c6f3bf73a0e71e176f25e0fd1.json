There is much mystery&nbsp; surrounding \nhis heritage. Family lore has it that he was a direct descendant&nbsp; of Issachar, son of our \npatriarch, Jacob. Pesach Langsam's wife was a niece (through her mother) of the Rebbe, \nR. Elimelech of Lezajsk. His lineage is well known and traces back through RASHI's \ndaughter, to King David. A book regarding his ancestry and offspring has been compiled \nby </b></font><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"4\"><b><a href=\"mailto:srwynne@erols.com\">Suzan Wynne</a></b></font><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"4\"><b>. Her work, entitled The Langsam-Spira Family, is still available. Pesach \nLangsam died on November 2, 1820, at the age of 72. Regarding Pesach's earlier years, \nthere is still much supposition. Even his wife's name is disputed. It was either Ita or \nRochel Mina. One thing is for certain. At some point they lived in a small town in Galicia \ncalled Yawornik Polski. It is near Blazowa & Dynow. Pesach had 6 known children; five \nboys and one girl Our branch of the family is connected to Pesach Langsam . Hersh and \nRuchel Langsam&nbsp; my grandparents lived in Blazova at the end of the 19th century.</b></font> </p>\n<ul><ul><ul><ul><p>&nbsp;</p>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p align=\"center\">&nbsp; <font size=\"6\"><b>The family tree</b></font></p>\n<ul><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"oscar/tree.jpg\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"oscar/map-pol.jpg\" border=\"0\"></p>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<p><font size=\"4\">My parents Esther Leinhardt and Aharon Langsam came to Danzig (today, Gdansk) in the year \n1929 from their home town in Poland - Blazova. They were married December 1929. and I their \nfirst son Oscar Jehoshua was born January 1931. Life was good in those years, but became \nunbearable in 1934 when the Nazi Party in Danzig gained strength and Jews were being \npersecuted. Their second son Herman was born in 1937.</font> </p>\n<blockquote><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"oscar/langsam31.jpg\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"oscar/webpicoscachen.jpg\" align=\"middle\" border=\"0\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"oscar/webfam.jpg\" align=\"middle\" border=\"0\"></p></blockquote>\n<p><font face=\"Times New Roman\" size=\"4\"><b>On the first of September 1939 the Wehrmacht (German army) attacked the Polish \ngarrison on Westerplatte which controlled the entrance to the Danzig harbour and the \ncity became part of the third Reich.

On the boat were about 1300 Jewish men and \nwomen most of them from Austria fleeing from Nazi persecution. No one of them made it, \nthe boat was detained in Yugoslavia and all the refugees were arrested by the Nazis after \nGermany occupied Yugoslavia.

Three months later after a very \ndangerous and frustrating voyage we arrived in Haifa Palestine escorted by a British \nwarship which had intercepted the freighter&nbsp; because it was trying to bring Jewish \nrefugees to the shores of Palestine without the permission of the British Government. \nEsther Langsam with her two boys were detained in Atlith, Palestine.
