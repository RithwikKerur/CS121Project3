We would appreciate any help that may be available.\n\n    Two-dimensional Wythoff's Game is a combinatorial game played by \ntwo players using two piles of objects.  On each turn, a player may remove\nsome or all of the objects from one pile or the same number of objects from\nboth piles.  The goal of the fame is for a player to remove all of the objects\non his or her turn.\n    The study of Wythoff's Game centers around the study of Wythoff's \npairs, which are positions in the Game where a player is guaranteed the \nwin if he or she has just moved to that position.  A Wythoff pair is an ordered pair (a,b) where a and b represent the number of objects in the respective\npiles.  It turns out that the Wythoff pairs have several interesting\nFibonacci and golden ratio properties.\n        My student has attempted to move the game into three dimensions,\nusing three piles.  He hopes to find similar properties in the new\nvariation.  If you have any help or would like to see the Wythoff triples,\nplease write @schien.cs.uah.edu.\n \n    \nordered pair (a,b) where a and b represent the number of objects in the\nrespective piles.
