BLIP's\npurpose is to provide a language and platform-independent wire protocol\nfor high-speed, large-scale, reliable, topic-based messaging. These\n\"enterprise-level\" features will also be required by many\nconsumer/personal applications in the near future. Providing this within\na simple framework is another BLIP design goal, as future notification\nservices should be able to run on pocket computers and pager-size\ndevices. BLIP seems to scale well in early experiments.\n \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
