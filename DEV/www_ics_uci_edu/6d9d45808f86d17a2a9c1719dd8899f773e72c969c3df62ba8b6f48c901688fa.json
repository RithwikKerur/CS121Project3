You seem to be &quot;a stikel \r\nmischpoche&quot; with my wife, who is supposed to be a descendant of the first \r\nDynover Rebbe (R. Zvi Elimelech Spira, 1783-1841).\r\n     \r\nAccording to Sam Fisch (living in Queens, first cousin of my wife's \r\ngrandparents, who happened to be first cousins themselves) the Dynover Rebbe \r\nhad a daughter (he is not sure about her first name: Malka? Jitte Lea?), who \r\nwas married to Rabbi Jakov Uri of Turka. Their daughter, Chawa Uri, was \r\nmarried to Samuel (haLevi) Fisch, the grandfather of the mentioned source, \r\nSam Fisch.\r\n     \r\nLooking at your family tree on Internet I come to the conclusion that you \r\nseem to have the book &quot;The Langsam-Spira family&quot; (published in 1986, which \r\nI received from Suzan Wynne). As in that book, you also mention that a \r\ndaughter of the Dynover Rebbe, called Rivka, was married to R. Jakov Uri. \r\nBut so far, apart from Sam Fisch, nobody seems to know anything about any \r\nother children than the son Avraham Joschua Heshel.\r\n     \r\nRecently I received a letter from a Alan Miller (New York) who wrote that \r\nhe knows of an other connection than the one I got from Sam Fisch. Alan \r\nMiller writes that a daughter of Zvi Elimelech Spira, called Sara, was \r\nmarried to a man called Moshe; their daughter Lea was married to R. Jakov \r\nUri and their daughter again, called Frieda was married to Schmuel Zanvil \r\nKalech (born 1840 in Galicia), brother of the great-grandfather of Alan \r\nMiller.\r\n     \r\nIndeed, Zvi Elimelech Spira seems  to have had a daughter called Sara, \r\nmarried to a Moshe (Schonfeld), but there is no Frieda among their \r\nchildren. It's all very confusing!\r\n     \r\nAlthough Sam Fisch seems to be very sure about the relationship, I'd like \r\nto find an other source for his presentation. Do you know anything more or \r\ndo you know who could help me any further?\r\n     \r\nSincerely\r\n     \r\nDaniel Teichman\r\nKurfirstenstrasse 8\r\nCH-8002  Zuerich\r\nE-mail: 106607,620@compuserve.com or Daniel.Teichman@vsao.ch\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nAuthor:  Daniel Teichman &lt;106607.620@compuserve.com&gt; at INTERNET\r\nDate:    11/26/97  6:28 PM\r\nPriority: Normal\r\nCC: Moishe Miller at CCSP27B1\r\nTO: Suzan Wynne &lt;srwynne@erols.com&gt; at INTERNET\r\nCC: Andr&eacute; L&eacute;vy &lt;levy@eye.ch&gt; at INTERNET\r\nCC: Neil Rosenstein &lt;Neil185@aol.com&gt; at INTERNET\r\nCC: Louis Schonfeld &lt;lmagyar@en.com&gt; at INTERNET\r\nCC: David Sheby &lt;hosp@voicenet.com&gt; at INTERNET\r\nSubject: Chawa FISCH\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\nDear distant relatives and friends!\r\n     \r\nThank you all for your help with my research in my wife's ancestry. You all \r\nknow that for the past ten years I tried to find out the exact connection \r\nbetween my wife and Rav Zvi Elimelech of Dynow (the &quot;Bnej Jisasschar&quot;).\r\n     \r\nI had the information that my wife's great-great-grandmother, Chawa \r\n(married to Schmuel Fisch) was the daughter of R. Jakov Uri of Turka, who \r\nwas married to a daughter of R. Zvi Elimelech of Dynow. My informant, Sam \r\nFisch (grandson of Schmuel and Chawa Fisch) didn't remember the name of \r\nthis daughter of the Dynower Rebbe exactly (Jitte Lea or Malka?).\r\n     \r\nWell, today I received the copy of the death certificate of Chawa Fisch-Uri \r\n(thank you Suzan for the address and the information about what I can find \r\nin Sanok!). She died in Zagorz in 1932 at the age of 82. The document gives \r\nher father's name as &quot;Jakub Uri&quot; and her mother's name as &quot;Itta Leja&quot; (no \r\nsurname mentioned).\r\n     \r\nThe informations imply that Chawa Fisch-Uri was born in 1850. Rav Jakob Uri \r\ndied in Turka in 1855, so this fits well. His first wife, Rivka (daughter \r\nof the Dynover Rebber) is said to have died before her father, e.g. before \r\n1841. So by 1850 he may well have been married to &quot;Itta Leja&quot;. \r\n     \r\nSome of you gave me the information that Jakov Uri was first married to a \r\ndaughter of the Dynover Rebbe (Rivka) and then to a granddaughter of the \r\nDynover Rebbe. This second wife was the daughter of Moshe Schonfeld, who \r\nwas married to Sara Spira, daughter of Rav Zvi Elimelech of Dynow. \r\n     \r\nLast year I received a letter from Alan Miller, who wrote to me that &quot;a \r\ndaughter of Zvi Elimelech Spira, called Sara, was married to a man called \r\nMoshe; their daughter Lea (sic!) was married to R. Jakov Uri and their \r\ndaughter again, called Frieda was married to Schmuel Zanvil Kalech&quot; (born \r\n1840 in Galicia, brother of the great-grandfather of Alan Miller).\r\n     \r\nThe name Lea is also mentioned in a letter from Suzan (August 20, 1997): \r\n&quot;Turning now to Alan and Lou's contention that Yaakov Uri married Sara's \r\ndaughter, Lea Schonfeld, after his wife Rivka's death&quot;\r\n     \r\nFinally this all fits well with the informations I received from Sam Fisch, \r\nwho actually did remember his grandmother mother's name (Jitte Lea), only \r\nthat Jitte Leja was not a daughter, but a granddaughter of the Dynover \r\nRebbe.\r\n     \r\nSo I come to the conclusion that my wife's grandparents (who were first \r\ncousins, both grandchildren of Chawa Fisch-Uri) were \r\ngreat-great-great-grandchildren of the Dynower Rebbe and for my own \r\nchildren I have to add three other &quot;greats&quot;.\r\n     \r\nIt seems that finally all the misteries are solved and I thank you all \r\nagain for your help and the informations you provided me with.\r\n     \r\nBest regards\r\n     \r\nDaniel Teichman (Zurich, Switzerland) \r\ne-mail: Daniel.Teichman@vsao.ch\r\n     \r\n     \r\nP.S.    \r\n     \r\n1.

I'd\r\nlike to find out more about this branch as well! Any suggestions?\r\nAs to the (only?) child of the first marriage of Jakov Uri (with Rivka):\r\nSarah Honig in Israel has - as to my knowledge - worked the most on his\r\ndescendants.

I hope this finds you all well. Its been a long time since we were all \r\non the same communication.\r\nLouie Schonfeld just sent me a copy of \"L'Bais Ahvosum\" (To Their Father's \r\nHouse), by Yehuda Friedman, 1994, Ashdod, Israel.\r\nIn it, on page 40, he lists all the known children (to him) of Yakov Uri, \r\nfrom both marriages; to R' Zvi Elimelech's daughter Rivka, and to his \r\ngranddaughter, the niece of his first wife.\r\nTo summarize:\r\nYakov Uri (d. 1855) married Rivka Spira, daughter of R' Zvi Elimelech. One \r\nof Rivka's sisters was Sara. This will be important soon.\r\nYakov, who Friedman lists as Yakov (Eliezer) Uri, had three children from \r\nthis marriage, a boy and two girls. Friedman lists these as:\r\n~ Avrohm Yehoshua Heschel Uri\r\n~ Henya, married to Eliyahu Meshulam Fisch\r\n~ Gittel Hinda, married to Moshe Rotenberg\r\nYakov Uri's first wife, Rivka Spira, died in her father's lifetime, so she \r\npassed on before 1841. Yakov Uri then married a Schonfeld, daughter of \r\nMoshe and Sara. Sara was another daughter of R' Zvi Elimelech, as was \r\nmentioned before. \r\nThis means that Yakov Uri married his niece, or his brother-in-law's \r\ndaughter. Therefore, some of his children were grandchildren of the Bnei \r\nYissochur and some were great-grandchildren.\r\nFriedman lists four children for the second marriage, a boy and three \r\ngirls. He does not list the name of Yakov Uri's second wife, only that she \r\nwas the daughter of Moshe Schonfeld.\r\nThe children listed were:\r\n~ Elyakim Uri\r\n~ Raizel, g-g-g-grandmother of Friedman, married to Yitzchok Isaac \r\nPerlmutter.\r\n~ Rochel Leah, married to Naftali Zeidenfeld\r\n~ Chana Mindel, married to Tzvi Neiman (Nyman).\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to Daniel Teichman's emails to us, from 2/24/97, 11/26/97, \r\nand 11/30/97. For those that do not have these, they can be viewed at my \r\nwebsite, under Uri, at\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira\\spira.htm\r\n(clicking on the \"The Uri Family\" link will take you to the letters, \r\nclicking on the tree image will take you to the homepage)\r\nThere, Daniel states that he comes from what would be a fifth child from \r\nYakov Uri's second marriage, Chana, married to Shmuel \"ha'Levi\" Fisch. He \r\nhas her death record, from Zagorz, in 1932. It lists her as being 82, \r\nwhich means born 1850. This is after the death of Yakov Uri's first wife \r\n(pre-1841). It lists her parents as Yakov and Itta Leja Uri.\r\nDaniel also speaks of a sixth child from the second marriage. Alan Miller \r\ng-grandfather had a brother named Schmuel Zanvil KALECH (born 1840). Alan \r\ntold Daniel that this uncle was married to Freida, daughter of Lea, which \r\npresumably was Itta Leja. It could not be the first wife because Schmuel \r\nZanvil was born after her death.\r\n\r\nThis means that Yakov Uri had NINE children. Some problems or issues with \r\nthis:\r\nThe surname Fisch is listed for marriages of daughters from each marriage \r\n(Henya and Chava). While not a problem (many families remarried into the \r\nsame families over and over), it still should be noted.\r\nFriedman lists the third child of Yakov Uri's second marriage as Rochel \r\nLEAH. Both Daniel and Alan say the wife was LEAH. Her daughter would not \r\nhave even the same partial name as her. This is obviously a problem. Since \r\nDaniel has records to support his claim, the Zeidenfeld connection is \r\nsuspect. \r\nDoes anybody know descendants of this family? Maybe she was from the first \r\nwife?\r\n\r\nDaniel, in your 11/26/97 letter you quote three additional sources from \r\nDr. Rosenstein. The second one is listed as\r\n2 Wunder, Me'orei Galicia - vol I, p.281\r\nThis should read p. 287, where a VERY brief entry for Yakov Uri is listed, \r\nor p. 280, or the Uri entries start.\r\n\r\nTo finally come to the point, can anybody shed more light on this? Louie, \r\ncan you contact Friedman and ask him about this? 1994 was five years ago, \r\npresumably he has received feedback on his book. \r\nDoes anybody else have more info to substantiate any of these families? \r\nDaniel, do you have more of this in Family Tree Maker or GEDCOM format? I \r\nwould like to obtain an updated copy. If not, would you be willing to try \r\nand flesh out all of Yakov Uri's offspring from both marriages?\r\nDr. Rosenstein, have you received any additional unpublished \"Broken \r\nChain\" material for R' Z. E. Spira?\r\n\r\nAny and all suggestions would be welcome. With your permission I will post \r\nthis to my website.\r\n\r\nRegards!\r\n-Moishe\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\n\r\n________________________________________________\r\nFrom:  106607.620@compuserve.com\r\nSubject:  Uri Family Tree\r\nPostedDate:  01/31/99 05:23:30 PM\r\nSendTo:  langsam@sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu,neurolevy@datacomm.ch,CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential,Neil185@aol.com,lmagyar@en.com,hosp@voicenet.com,srwynne@erols.com\r\nDeliveredDate:  01/31/99 05:24:55 PM\r\n\r\nDear friends and relatives,\r\n\r\nThank you, Moishe, for the initial mail and you, Louis, for the first\r\nresponses. During the 12 years I tried to understand the connection between\r\nmy wife (she is the descendant of all these famous Rabbis, not me) and the\r\nDynower Rebbe, I noticed a lot of contradictions in several sources.

Congratulations and thank\r\nyou very much for this fantastic work!\r\n\r\nIn a message from January 31th 1999, you asked a few questions. One was\r\nthat either Jakov Uri's second wife could not have had the name \"Lea\"\r\nbecause Friedmann in his book lists a daughter of this second marriage with\r\nthe name \"Rochel Leah\", or Rochel Lea must have been a daughter of the\r\nfirst marriage. On the website I noticed that you now listed Rochel Lea as\r\ndaughter of the first marriage. So I guess you were able to solve this\r\nproblem? May I ask what source you could find for this? Was Leo Hirsch\r\n(mentioned by Louis and you in following e-mails) of any help?\r\n\r\nAs addition to an other daughter of Jakov Uri and Rivka Spira, namely\r\nGittel Hinda (married to R Moshe Rottenberg, ABD Kozava): I have a\r\npostcard, written in Jiddish on December 16th 1940, from Mordechaj Fisch,\r\nson of Chava Fisch, sent from \"Fisch at Beile Rottenberg, Kozowa\". At the\r\nend Mordechaj writes: Frau Rottenberg is das ejn Mishpaha (Mrs Rottenberg\r\nis a relative).\r\n\r\nAs to your question regarding the Fish connections on both sides:\r\n1. Henya, daughter of Jakov Uri and Rivka Spira, married to Eliyahu\r\nMeshullam Fish\r\n2. Chava, daughter of Jakov Uri and Lea Schonfeld, married to Samuel Fisch\r\n\r\nYou wrote: While not a problem (many families remarried into the same\r\nfamilies over and over), it still should be noted.\r\nEven more puzzling is the fact, a grandson of Chava and Samuel Fisch\r\n(namely my wife's grandfather) was called Avraham MESHULLAM Fishl Fisch !\r\n\r\nMay I suggest to correct one obvious error on the website: Lea, married to\r\nR Jakov (who died 1855) can not be born in 1850, otherwise she would have\r\nbeen at the age of between 1 to 5 at her wedding! The dates are correct for\r\nher daughter though, Chava Fisch, who was born about 1850 and died in 1932.\r\nLea was probably born around 1830. And are you sure that the first\r\nmentioned son of Sara and Moshe Schonfeld, R Pesach Avrohm, was born in\r\n1821? This would make his father be 11 years old at the birth of his first\r\nchild!?\r\n\r\nOne further question: What happened to Louis' plea, not to neglect Sender\r\nUri's descendants (Rabbis Pinchas Arye and Akiva Gottlieb)? And to his\r\nsuggestion to find a liaison in Israel (Rabbi Meir Wunder or Yehuda\r\nFriedman)?\r\n\r\nBest regards to all of you!\r\n\r\nDaniel Teichman\r\nZurich, Switzerland\r\ne-mail: Daniel.Teichman@vsao.ch\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\nAuthorList:  CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential\r\nPostedDate:  04/15/99 08:45:19 PM\r\nSendTo:  106607.620 @compuserve.com @ Eagle2\r\nCopyTo:  langsam @sci.brooklyn.cuny.edu @ Eagle2,neurolevy @datacomm.ch @ Eagle2,mehadrin @aol.com @ Eagle2,Neil185 @aol.com @ Eagle2,lmagyar @en.com @ Eagle2,hosp @voicenet.com @ Eagle2,srwynne @erols.com @ Eagle2\r\nSubject:  Re: Uri - Fisch family\r\n\r\nDear Daniel,\r\n\r\nThank you for your kind words about the website.

He showed me a handwritten tree from Yosef Boruch \r\nSchechter with his sources noted on it. Attached were copies of those \r\nsources. I read it\r\nmyself (in the xeroxed Hebrew copy) and Yosef Boruch Schechter's \r\ncomments on it. He was the source.

Thanks for clarifying that there were indeed two Fisch sons-in-law for \r\nJakov Uri.\r\nAs an aside, the Fish family seems to play a role in Suzan's portion of \r\nthe tree.\r\n\r\n4). Thanks for the correction of the obvious error on the website: \r\nLea, married to R Jakov (who died 1855) can not be born in 1850, otherwise \r\nshe would\r\nhave been at the age of between 1 to 5 at her wedding!\"\r\nThis is my fault and illustrates how easy it is to create errors if you do \r\nnot\r\nuse family tree software (the website is generated by hand). Louie \r\nSchonfeld\r\nhad supplied me with extracts of census dates several researchers had \r\nfound for him, \r\nas well as a large tree he had. I was thrilled and just plugged them in.\r\nThat is the source for the 1821 date for R Pesach Avrohm as well. I did \r\nnot see\r\nactual copies, only a typed extract and computer generated tree. \r\n\r\nLouie, \r\nAny chance of taking a look at your originals for these two birth years?\r\n\r\n5). You asked if I was sure that the first mentioned son of Sara and Moshe \r\nSchonfeld, \r\nR Pesach Avrohm, was born in 1821? This would make his father be 11 years \r\nold at the \r\nbirth of his first child!? See #4 above. My guess is that it was a typo on \r\nthe extract and \r\nshould read 1831, but that is only a guess.\r\n\r\nLouie, \r\nOnce again, can you verify?\r\n\r\n6). Regarding Louis' plea, not to neglect Sender Uri's descendants (Rabbis \r\nPinchas \r\nArye and Akiva Gottlieb)? I wrote a couple of letters, but since the \r\ninitial response two \r\nyears ago, have not received any replies.\r\nCan anyone facilitate?\r\n\r\n7). Regarding a suggestion to find a liaison in Israel, based on some \r\nrecent \r\nexperiences, I personally would only be happy with a blood connection in \r\nthis \r\nposition. It is kind of a more vested interest. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThank you Daniel for all the effort you put into your letter. I will add \r\nit to the end of your \r\nemail page on the net, linked off your g-grandmother.\r\n\r\nG'Shabbos to you all!\r\n\r\n-Moishe\r\n\r\nPS: Who is hosp@voicenet.com ?\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Carole & Raphy Fisch\" <rfisch@tiscali.it> \r\nSubject: Re: Spira and Bukowsko \r\nDate: Thu, 26 Feb 2004 18:30:53 +0100 \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nHi Moishe,\r\n\r\nI am sorry that I didn't answer you before, but at the moment we have all\r\nour family, son, daughter and son-in-law, here from Israel.\r\n\r\nMy husband, Rephael Fisch's great grandmother was Chava Uri.\r\n\r\nI saw your site on Internet and noticed that Daniel Teichman had given you a\r\nfamily tree.
