These communities share resources to\nachieve shared or individual goals. Unlike the rigidly organized\nparallel systems of the past, these networks have relatively looser\ninterconnection regimes and allow, in fact expect, nodes and edges to\ncome and go as they please. We study the ability of networks to deal\nwith this highly dynamic situation by looking at the basic problem of\nrouting. We use the edge expansion of the network (roughly the number\nof edges per node going out of a given set of nodes) as our measure\nof\nthe ability to route packets efficiently. We study the effect if\nnodes\nleaving the system on the expansion of the network.  We also propose\na\nsystem of routing flows through disjoint paths to provide robustness\nagainst edges going down and analyze it in terms of the expansion.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
