The game adds stations with various shapes to a map and the player places a limited number of routes and vehicles to take passengers to their destination stations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis talk presents a work in progress analysis of the complexity class of the game. I will present an analysis of game mechanics, and potential approaches to achieve a reduction. \n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
