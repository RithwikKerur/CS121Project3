No known input causes our algorithm to use area Omega(n^{1+eps}) for any eps  > 0; finding such an input would represent significant progress on the famous k-set problem from discrete geometry. Drawing line arrangement graphs is the main task in the Planarity puzzle. \n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
