What is small is relative, but in my research, I consider\r\nanything less than 25MB as small.  This is in comparison to 'large' files such as movies and\r\nOS-distros that are hundreds of MBs of GBs in size.\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Why is Flash Dissemination (FD) useful and where can it be applied?</b>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen you think about it (and you can verify this), close to 90% of files (even excluding system files)\r\nsitting on your computer are small files (in terms of numbers). Thus, most information that people generate\r\nand store is in small files. Even cell phone generated video clips (which are becoming increasingly prevelant) are\r\nsmall files (less than 10 MB); so are YouTube clips. And when a piece of information becomes\r\nsuddenly popular, you have to handle its distribution scalably. The premise of my thesis is that the optimizations\r\nand the systems you need for scalably disseminating small files require a different approach and different set of\r\noptimizations as compared to large file content distribution (aka BitTorrent, Joost, etc.).\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn my PhD research, I've demonstarted two uses for FD. In one appplication,\r\n<a href=\"crew_ics_tr_2005.pdf\"> RapID (PDF file warning) </a> distributes\r\n<a href=\"http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/shakemap/\"> Earthquake ShakeMaps </a>\r\nto emergency response organizations extremely fast. In experiments run on a\r\n<a href=\"model-net-details.html\"> Internet Emulator </a>, we show that RapID\r\ncan disseminate shakemaps (of 200KBs) almost twice as fast as any other system currently\r\navailable.\r\n<br>\r\nIn another application, <a href=\"http://flashback.calit2.uci.edu\"> Flashback </a> (\r\n<a href=\"papers/flashback-dcs07.pdf\"> research paper </a>), we show another reason why distributing\r\nsmall content fast is a unique and interesting problem. Again, Flashback performs much better than simply\r\nadapting a large content distribution protocol (e.g. BitTorrent) for the purpose.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<b> How do I believe your numbers (aka, show me the money)? </b>\r\n<br>\r\nTo make our numbers as convincing as possible we built an <a href=\"model-net-details.html\"> Internet Testbed </a>\r\nwhich we call COIE (for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_on_Infinite_Earths\"> Crisis on Infinite Earths </a>\r\nor Cluster Of Ibm E-servers) using <a href=\"http://modelnet.ucsd.edu/\"> Modelnet </a>. The testbed was built on a\r\ncluster of 15 IBM e-server nodes running Debian and\r\n<a href=\"http://wiki.systemimager.org/index.php/Main_Page\"> SystemImager </a>. This testbed\r\nis capable of real-time emulation of upto 200 virtual internet hosts and one can even individually\r\nset each virtual node's bandwidth and also inter-node latency.\r\n<br>\r\nWe build real systems and compare them to other real deployed systems on this testbed.  As far as numbers go,\r\nwe feel this is as close as you can get without actually deploying your system on the wide-area internet.  Of course,\r\nthe final proof of the pudding will be in real-world deployment.  We are currently readying Flashback for such a deployment.\r\nYou can help us in visiting the <a href=\"http://flashback.calit2.uci.edu\"> Flashback web-page </a> and giving it a try\r\nand letting us know how it worked for you.\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Dynamicity in P2P Networks</h2>\r\n<p>\r\nFrom a science perspective, I'm also extremely curious about the fundamental\r\nproperties and characteristics of P2P networks and their relation to other types\r\nof networks such as ecological, social and technological (WWW, router-network). The\r\nphysics modeling of these networks is another topic that I try to follow to the\r\nbest of my understanding :)\r\n<br>\r\nIn a small study, I investigated how different networks evolve over time.\r\nusing well-known models of network formation such as random graphs and\r\npower-law graphs. My primary focus was on P2P overlay networks but the results\r\nthat emerged showed that resulting networks are also sometimes observed in nature.\r\n<br>\r\nWith regards to P2P overlays, the main conclusion that emerged is that, it is better\r\nto design network protocols that do not implicitly\r\nor explicitly encourage power-law (or rich get richer) behavior.\r\nThe link to this paper can be found <a href=\"papers/p2p.pdf\"> here </a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h1>Middleware Design and Implementation</h1>\r\n<h2></h2>\r\n<p>\r\nPreviously, I've been involved in enhancing scalability of CORBA middleware part of the\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/\"> DOC Group </a> led by\r\nProf. Douglas Schmidt.\r\n<br>\r\nI co-designed and implemented the first server-side Asynchronous Method Handling (AMH)\r\nmechanism for CORBA middleware in\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html\"> TAO </a>\r\nAMH solves the problem of stack-blowup on server-side due to large number of long-standing\r\nrequests on middle-tier servers. The solution involved explicitly encapsulating each server\r\nrequest into a heap-stored object that freed up stack-space of the server-thread while\r\nalso allowing it to do other work. AMH improves throughput of middle-servers by over\r\n10% as compared to other traditional synchronous threading designs.\r\n<br>\r\nImplementation involved designing a new specification for CORBA server-side, changes to the IDL-compiler,\r\nand the ORB-core of TAO, an industry-strength CORBA middleware that is over 100K lines of C++ code.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"rightcontent\">\r\n<h2> Current Work</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://flashback.calit2.uci.edu\"> Flashback </a>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Past Work </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html\">AMH</a>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.zen.uci.edu/\">ZEN</a>\r\n<br>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h2> Interesting Stuff </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n<a href=\"killer_app.html\">Building and Testing the Next Killer P2P App</a>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<a href=\"google_servers.html\">How Many Servers Does Google Have?</a>\r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js\" type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n</script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n_uacct = \"UA-556186-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- START INCLUDED FOOTER -->\r\n<center>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<span class=\"G9G\"><a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer\" title=\"W3C HTML Validation\" target=\"_blank\">HTML</a> &#8226; <a href=\"http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer/\" title=\"W3C CSS Validation\" target=\"_blank\">CSS</a> &#8226; <a href=\"http://bobby.watchfire.com/\" title=\"U.S. Section 508 Accessibility\" target=\"_blank\">508</a></span>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- END INCLUDED FOOTER -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n</center>", "encoding": "ascii"}
