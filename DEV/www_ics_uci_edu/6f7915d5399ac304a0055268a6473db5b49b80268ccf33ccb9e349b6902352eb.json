Spatiotemporally anchored stories consist of a network of story nodes in which each node depicts a small element of the overall plot, and is anchored to a specific location in space and time. </p>\n<p>To advance the story users explore a rich geographical representation of the relevant spatiotemporal locale, discovering story nodes and the interconnections between them. Because nodes can be anchored at variable levels of spatiotemporal resolution and interlinked in non-linear ways, exploring these narratives will help children to develop more nuanced abilities for reasoning about distributed causation and variable scale. These abilities, in turn, will translate into more effective engagement with environmental issues.</p>\n<p>The EAGER program is intended to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches, therefore the grant will go toward funding the creation of a testbed interactive narrative, to be deployed online and as a temporary science museum exhibit. This narrative will use spatiotemporal anchoring along with video and traditional cinematographic techniques to dramatize the interactions that take place within a representative California ecosystem, for example, a marine environment in which sea otters, kelp forests, and sea urchins all interact. </p>\n<p>Tomlinson's research deals with the social impacts of information technologies, in particular regarding environmental issues and interactive education systems.

But there has been a complex pattern of\n                   success and failure in such efforts.  Olson and his colleagues have spent nearly a decade studying these projects, trying to figure out what\n                   accounts for the pattern of success and failure in them. In his talk he reviewed lessons learned, and where he hopes to go with further research\n                   in the area. </p>\n<p>The current understanding from this investigation was recently summarized in a book entitled \"Scientific Collaboration on the Internet\" (MIT\n                   Press, 2008). </p>\n<p>This week in Baltimore, Olson will give a keynote entited \"The Next Generation of Science Collaboratories\". Olson will also talk about how the\n                   changing technical scene opens new opportunities for the next generation of collaboratories, as well as the sociotechnical factors that\n                   distinguish successful from unsuccessful collaboratories. </p>\n<p>Collaboratories to support scientific research have been around for at least two decades, and have emerged as an important form of\n                   cyberinfrastructure to enable ever more ambitious geographically distributed research projects.  A broadened view of what a collaboratory is\n                   suggests there are a variety of kinds of functions they could support. </p>\n<p>Early collaboratories were often rather narrow in focus, but some have broadened to mimic fully-functional laboratories.  Furthermore, will\n                   almost all early collaboratories were in the physical and biological sciences, by now they have emerged as serious research infrastructure in\n                   most domains, including the social sciences and humanities. </p>\n<p>Olson&#8217;s latest research focuses on how to support small groups of people working on difficult intellectual tasks, particularly when the members\n                   of the group are geographically distributed.  This research has involved both field studies of groups attempting to do such work and lab studies\n                   that evaluate specific technologies.

CHI 2009 ran from April 4-9, in Boston, MA offering two days of pre-conference workshops and four days of dynamic sessions that explored the future of computer-human interaction with researchers, practitioners, educators and students.</p>\n<p>More than 2000 professionals from over 40 countries attended this year's conference, which marked 27 years of research, innovation and development of the Computer-Human Interaction community.</p>\n<p>Olson has published about 110 peer-reviewed research articles and is best known for her work on distance collaborations and has achieved international acclaim for her studies that compared office workers in geographically distributed organizations to those working in the same location.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><strong><a name=\"tsudik_ipsec2009\"></a>Tsudik to give keynote on secure device pairing at IPSEC 2009</strong></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"> <img alt=\"photo: gene tsudik\" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/gtsudik.jpg\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><strong>Gene<br/>\n                  Tsudik</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>Professor of Computer Science <strong>Gene Tsudik</strong> will be giving an invited keynote talk entitled \"Secure and Usable Device Pairing\" at the 5th <a href=\"http://www.ispec2009.net/\">Information Security Practice and Experience Conference (ISPEC 2009)</a> to be held April 13-15, 2009, in Xi&#8217;an, China.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Secure Device Pairing&#8221; is the process of bootstrapping a secure channel between two or more previously unassociated personal devices over a (usually wireless) human-imperceptible communication channel. Lack of prior security context and absence of common trust infrastructure open the door for so-called \"Man-in-the-Middle\" (or \"Evil Twin\") attacks. Mitigation of these attacks requires user involvement in the device pairing process.</p>\n<p>Tsudik&#8217;s talk will summarize notable secure device pairing techniques, comparing and contrasting their advantages, shortcomings and limitations, followed by the first comprehensive and comparative evaluation of these methods.</p>\n<p>ISPEC is an annual conference that brings together researchers and practitioners to provide a confluence of new information security technologies, their applications and their integration with IT systems in various vertical sectors.  More information about ISPEC can be found at the Conference Web site:  http://www.ispec2009.net/.</p>\n<p>Tsudik's research interests are mainly in computer/network security, privacy and applied cryptography. His recent work focuses on privacy in Internet services, RFID systems and mobile ad hoc networks, as well as security in sensor networks and storage systems.</p>\n<p>His research also covers secure group communication, in particular, group key agreement, group signatures and group access control.
