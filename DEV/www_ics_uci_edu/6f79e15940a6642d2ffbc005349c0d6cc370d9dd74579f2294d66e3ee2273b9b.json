ACM vol. 31, issue 1, pp. 114-127, 1984.</h2>\n<h2> Presented by Kevin Wortman </h2>\n\nAbstract. It is demonstrated that the linear programming problem in d\nvariables and n constraints can be solved in O(n) time when d is\nfixed. This bound follows from a multidimensional search technique\nwhich is applicable for quadratic programming as well. There is also\ndeveloped an algorithm that is polynomial in both n and d provided d\nis bounded by a certain slowly growing function of n.\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
