The context is CAD/CAE, which has various\nrepresentations for solid objects. At issue is the efficient\nevaluation of geometric objects known as tensor product surfaces\nand hypersurfaces. A hypersurface is shown to be a tensor product\nof polynomials, which can be written in various forms, depending on\nchoice of basis vectors in the linear space of polynomial\ncoefficients. This leads to the question of efficiency of\nevaluating the tensor product form. We mention the industrial\ncontext, followed by a review of lower bounds on polynomial\nevaluation and show how these stack-up with traditional tensor\nproduct evaluation methods. This is followed by some extensions.\nThe talk ends with a working session structured around four\ndifferent potential approaches.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
