More specifically, a K_{l}-expansion consists of l\nvertex-disjoint trees, every two of which are joined by an edge. We\ncall such an expansion odd if its vertices can be two-coloured, so\nthat the edges of the trees are bichromatic, but the edges between\ntrees are monochromatic. In this paper, the authors show that, for\nevery l, if a graph contains no odd K_{l}-expansion then its\nchromatic number is O(l\\sqrt{logl}). In doing so, they obtain a\ncharacterization of graphs which contain no odd K_{l}-expansion.\nThey, also, prove that, given a graph and a subset S of its vertex\nset, either there are k vertex-disjoint odd paths with endpoints in\nS, or there is a set X of at most 2k-2 vertices such that every odd\npath with both ends in S contains a vertex in X. Some algorithmic\nimplications of this result are also discussed.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
