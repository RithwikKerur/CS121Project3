In a binary search tree formed by inserting n > 2 different values in\na random permutation without rebalancing, what is the probability that\nthe node for the median value has exactly one child node? (Hint: this\nevent depends only on the relative order of insertion of the median\nvalue and its two closest neighbors in the sorted sequence of inputs.)\n\n\n2. Give pseudocode for an algorithm range(T,l,r) that answers queries\nwhere the inputs to the query are the root node T of a binary search\ntree and two numbers l and r, and the output is a collection of all the\nkeys x_i in T with l < x_i < r. Your algorithm should take time O(h+k)\nwhere h is the height of the tree and k is the length of its output.\n\n\n3. Suppose that T is a splay tree, on three items with keys 1, 2, and 3,\nand that all three of the keys have already been searched for since the\nmost recent time the set of keys in T changed. Based on this\ninformation, how many different shapes might T possibly have? Draw them\nall.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
