Group work on\nhomeworks is permitted and encouraged. Knowledge of a previous course in\nthe design and analysis of algorithms (such as the CS 161 or CS 260\ncourses taught at UCI) is expected, but otherwise all CS graduate\nstudents are welcome.</p>\n\n<p>The textbook for this course will\nbe <a href=\"http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Vijay.Vazirani/book.pdf\"><i>Approximation\nAlgorithms</i></a>, by Vijay Vazirani.\nThe tentative schedule of topics is to go through the chapters of this book at a rate of approximately one chapter per lecture.</p>\n\n<p>Tentative schedule:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Week 1: Chapters 1-2 (combinatorial algorithms). Homework, due in class Friday, Jan 16: Exercises 1.1, 1.3, 2.8, 2.14.</li>\n<li>Week 2: Chapters 3-5 (combinatorial algorithms).
