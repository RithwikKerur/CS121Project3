Olson has worked in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field since 1983, when he and colleagues Judy Olson (a fellow informatics professor), Paul Green and Marilyn Mantei taught the first graduate course on the subject at the <a href=\"http://informatics.umich.edu/\">University of Michigan</a>.</p>\n<p>Olson&#8217;s contribution to HCI has largely revolved around the concept of distance. From the mid-1980s he and Judy Olson began researching the role technology plays in collaboration. The pair published their highly cited paper, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/&#126;corps/phaseii/OlsonOlson-DistanceMatters-HCIJ.pdf\">Distance Matters</a>,&#8221; on the subject in 2000 and later authored &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Working-Together-Apart-Collaboration-Human-Centered/dp/1608450503\">Working Together Apart</a>.&#8221; Olson has long played an active role in SIGCHI, co-chairing and chairing numerous conferences, as well as award and steering committees. SIGCHI previously elected Olson to the CHI academy and, along with Judy Olson, awarded him a Lifetime Achievement Award in 2006.</p>\n<p>In addition to Olson, two ICS alumni were also honored in this year&#8217;s round of awards. <strong><a href=\"http://cmci.colorado.edu/&#126;palen/\">Leysia Palen</a></strong>, professor and founding chair of the newly established Department of Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, was elected to the CHI academy. She earned her Ph.D. in information and computer science in 1998. <strong><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/dmrussell/Home\">Daniel Russell</a></strong>, a senior research scientist at Google, was also elected to the CHI academy.

This follows his trend of more than $1 million per year on average in research expenditures.</p>\n<p>Franz currently runs two projects funded by DARPA&#8217;s Cyber Fault-Tolerant Attack Recovery (CFAR) Program, for which he received nearly $2 million and roughly $700,000 in May, respectively. The CFAR Program aims to &#8220;produce revolutionary breakthroughs in defensive cyber techniques that can be deployed to protect existing and planned software systems in both military and civilian contexts without requiring changes to the concept of operations of these systems,&#8221; according to a <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/program/cyber-fault-tolerant-attack-recovery\">statement</a> by program manager John Everett.</p>\n<p>Franz also runs a project funded by DARPA&#8217;s Vetting Commodity IT Software and Firmware Program (VET), which addresses &#8220;the threat of hidden malicious functionality in COTS (Commercial Off-the-Shelf) IT devices ... including mobile phones, printers, computer workstations and many other everyday items,&#8221; according to a <a href=\"http://www.darpa.mil/program/vetting-commodity-it-software-and-firmware\">statement</a> by program manager Timothy Fraser. He received nearly $65,000 for this project.</p>\n<p>Finally, in July, Franz received nearly $620,000 from the NSF for a <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1513837\">collaborative project</a> titled &#8220;ENCORE&#8212;ENhanced program protection through COmpiler-REwriter cooperation.&#8221; According to the abstract, the project will produce &#8220;a prototype implementation consisting of a producer-side metadata derivation engine, and a consumer-side binary rewriting engine using this metadata to safely perform binary code manipulation.&#8221; In the past year, Franz has also received unrestricted gifts from Qualcomm, Oracle and Mozilla totaling $263,000.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --></p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Noteworthy achievements archive:</strong></p>\n<div style=\"padding: 0 1em;\">\n<div><a href=\"notes_2014.php\">Fall 2014 - Summer 2015</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"notes_2013.php\">Fall 2013 - Summer 2014</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"notes_2012.php\">Fall 2012 - Summer 2013</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"notes_2011.php\">Fall 2011 - Summer 2012</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"notes_2010.php\">Fall 2010 - Summer 2011</a></div>\n<div><a href=\"notes_2009.php\">Fall 2009 - Summer 2010</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sidebar\"><div>\n<div id=\"sidebar_title\">More news and events</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"../index.php\">News Stories</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../press/index.php\">Press releases</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/UCIBrenICS\">Video highlights</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"../../../about/annualreport/index.php\">Annual reports</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://calendar.ics.uci.edu/calendar.php\">Calendar of events</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin: 2em 1em; font-size: 80%;\">Media interested in interviewing ICS faculty, students or alumni should contact Matt Miller at <nobr>(949) 824-1562</nobr> or via email at <a href=\"mailto:matt.miller@uci.edu\">matt.miller@uci.edu</a>.</p></div>\n<div id=\"links_bottom\"><div style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; notmargin-left: 1em; border: 0px dotted grey;\"><form name=\"quicklinksform\"><span style=\"color: #0064a4; font-weight: bold; font-size: 13px;\">Quick Links </span><select name=\"linkselect\" onchange=\"location.href=quicklinksform.linkselect.options[selectedIndex].value\">\n<option value=\"#\">- select a page -</option>\n<option value=\"/computing/index.php\">Computing support</option>\n<option value=\"http://www.cs.uci.edu/research/seminarseries/\">CS Seminar Series</option>\n<option value=\"/employment/\">Employment</option>\n<option value=\"/about/facilities/index.php\">Facilities</option>\n<option value=\"/about/search/index.php\">Find faculty and staff</option>\n<option value=\"/supportICS\">Giving to the Bren School</option>\n<option value=\"/grad/degrees/index.php\">Graduate degrees</option>\n<option value=\"/about/kfflab/index.php\">Kay Family Foundation Lab</option>\n<option value=\"/community/friends/proj125/index.php\">Project ICS</option>\n<option value=\"/prospective\">Prospective undergraduates</option>\n<option value=\"/about/about_safety.php\">Safety procedures</option>\n<option value=\"/ugrad/degrees/index.php\">Undergraduate degrees</option>\n</select></form></div>\n<div id=\"socmed_icons\" style=\"float: right;\"><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/uc-irvine-information-and-computer-sciences\"><img alt=\"LinkedIn\" border=\"0\" class=\"icon32\" src=\"../../../bin/img/logos/socialmedia/linkedin.png\"/></a> <a href=\"http://youtube.com/UCIBrenICS\"><img alt=\"YouTube\" border=\"0\" class=\"icon32\" src=\"../../../bin/img/logos/socialmedia/youtube.png\"/></a> <a href=\"http://twitter.com/UCIbrenICS\"> <img alt=\"Twitter\" border=\"0\" class=\"icon32\" src=\"../../../bin/img/logos/socialmedia/twitter.png\"/></a> <a href=\"http://instagram.com/ucibrenics/\"> <img alt=\"Instagram\" border=\"0\" class=\"icon32\" src=\"../../../bin/img/logos/socialmedia/instagram.png\"/></a> <a href=\"http://facebook.com/UCIBrenICS\"> <img alt=\"Facebook\" border=\"0\" class=\"icon32\" src=\"../../../bin/img/logos/socialmedia/facebook.png\"/></a></div>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div>\n<div id=\"footer\"><a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/copyright.php\">Copyright Inquiries</a> | <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/cgi-bin/phonebook\">UCI Directory</a> | <a href=\"http://intranet.ics.uci.edu/\">Intranet</a></div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\");\ndocument.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src='\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics.com/ga.js' type='text/javascript'%3E%3C/script%3E\"));\n</script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\nvar pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-605898-1\");\npageTracker._trackPageview();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
