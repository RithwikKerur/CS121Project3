The occurrence of an\nevent in a component (called source) is asynchronously notified to any\nother component (called recipient) that has declared some interest in\nit. This paradigm holds the promise of supporting a flexible and\neffective interaction among highly reconfigurable distributed software\ncomponents.  We have developed an object-oriented infrastructure,\ncalled JEDI (Java Event-based Distributed Infrastructure), to support\nthe development and operation of event-based systems. During the past\nyear, JEDI has been used to implement the OPSS workflow management\nsystem. A WorkFlow Management System (WFMS) is an environment for\ndeveloping and executing process-based applications. A process-based\napplication is a software system that guides the execution of a\ncoordinated set of activities involving both humans and computerized\ntools. Typical examples, are business services such as customer care\nor interoffice procedures.  \nThe presentation illustrates JEDI main features and how we have used\nit to implement the OPSS workflow management system. Moreover, it\nprovides an initial evaluation of our experiences in using an\nevent-based architectural style.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
