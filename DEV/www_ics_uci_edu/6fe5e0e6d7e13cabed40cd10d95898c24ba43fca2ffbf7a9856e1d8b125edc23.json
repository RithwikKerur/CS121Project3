The main goal is to continue our\ndevelopment of an add-on for the Thunderbird email client software. The\nadd-on will enable Thunderbird to do fuzzy keyword search on emails. We\ncurrently have a prototype of the add-on and we are looking for a student\nto finalize it and make it stable so that we can release it to the public\ndomain.  The student should be familiar with JavaScript and C++. Tutoring\nand help would be provided.\n\nWe already released a couple of web services that include fuzzy-search\ntechniques developed by our team. One recent release is a people-search\nservice for the UCI campus called PSearch: http://psearch.ics.uci.edu/, a\njoint effort with NACS. To get more information about our research, please\nvisit Prof. Chen Li's home page: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~chenli/ The\nstudent can do the project as an indepdent study to earn credits.\nInterested students can contact Prof. Chen Li (chenli AT ics dot uci.edu) directly.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
