I will\nsuggest projects focusing on scheduling and timetabling problems that\nshould be solved by heuristic search and constraint processing\nalgorithms.  Students can propose their own projects subject to\napproval.\n<p>\nNecessary reading and some initial instructions will be given in the\nfirst week,  however students will be responsible to close the knowledge\ngap in heuristic search and constraint processing algorithms.\n<p>\nGroups of 2, 3, or 4 students will be formed for each project.  Final\nproject:  submit a report + code + demo.\n\n\n\n<p>\n<B> Outline: </B>\n\n\n<p><ul>\n<li>\nWeek 2:  Beginning of second week give one paragraph for a project\nproposal.\n<br>\n<li>\nWeek 4:  Progress report\n<br>\n<li>\nWeek 6:  Progress report and partial demo\n<br>\n<li>\nWeek 8:  End of eight week final report (draft)\n<br>\n<li>\nWeek 10:  Final report + code + demo-presentation </ul>\n<br>\n<p>\nThe following assignment tasks will be considered:\n<ol>\n<li>Assigning reviewers to papers (will be used for demonstration)\n<li>Assigning Instructors to classes\n<li>Assigning TA's to classes\n<li>Timetabling (high-school):  assigning classes and teachers to time\nslots.  Real data will be provided whenever possible.</ol>\n\n<p>\n1. <b> Assign papers to reviewers:i</b>\nGiven a set of preferences on papers (degrees 1-4) assign a fixed number\nK of papers to each of $n$ reviewers such that to maximize degree of\nstatisfaction.  (Example, scheduling reviewers to cp2000)\n<p>\n2. <b> Assignment of instructors to classes:</b>\nGiven instructors preferences for teaching 4 classes, two graduate and\ntwo undergraduate, and given class requirements, assign instructor to\nclasses and to quarters to maximally degree of satisfaction.  (Real\ndata: scheduling in ICS for year 2000-2001)\n<p>\n3. <b> TA assignments:</b>\nGiven class schedules for quarter, the number of TA needed for each\nclass TA's preferences and qualification, and instructors' choice of\npreferred TA, schedule the TA's in a way that maximize some measure of\nstaisfaction.  (Real data:  scheduling TA's for Spring 2000)\n<p>\n4.  <b>Class scheduling:</b>\nThe project is to experiment with the application and approach described\nin \"A Constraint-Based Approach to High-School Timetabling Problems:  A\nCase Study\" (paper will be given).  The problem is to find a schedule\nfor classes, classrooms, and teachers for a high-school.\n</ol>  <p>\n<p>\nMeasure of satisfaction can be to minimize the number of weighted\nconstraints violated.  Or, to minimize the maximum number of constraints\nviolated for each element (TA, professor).\n<p>\nSome algorithms written by graduate students are available for binary\nCSPs.  Students can try to adapt those to the problem or code the\nalgorithms from scratch.  Students can also use the constraint\nprogramming language Eclipse.\n<br><br></td></tr>\n</table>\n</center>\n<p>\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\n     <div id=\"footer\"><centeR>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu\">School of Information and Computer Science</A>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu\">University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3435</a>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter\">Dr. Rina Dechter</A>\n\r\n<A HREF=\"mailto:dechter_at_ics.uci.edu\">dechter at ics.uci.edu</A>\r\n\n</center></div>\n<!--- End Footer -->\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
