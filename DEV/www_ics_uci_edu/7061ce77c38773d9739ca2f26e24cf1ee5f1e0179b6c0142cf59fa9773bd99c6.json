IRUS was established in recognition of the software \nindustry's critical importance to California and the nation. IRUS strives \nto enhance abilities to design, produce, assess, and maintain diverse types \nof software through cooperative problem-solving and\nsharing of information and experience. \n<p>\nResearch and technical emphases of IRUS include:\n<ul>\n<li> Software Processes, Workflow, and Process Improvement\n<li> Computer-Supported Cooperative Work \n<li> Human Computer Interaction \n<li> Software Architectures and Design\n<li> Analysis and Testing \n<li> Extensible Systems\n<li> Hyperware and World Wide Web Protocols, Tools, and Standards\n<li> Distributed Object Technologies\n<li> Software Understanding\n</ul>\n\nIRUS was chartered by the Chancellor of the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A>\n in 1990 to help the software industry meet its never-ending \ntechnical challenges. IRUS serves as a focal point for interactions within \nthe Southern California software industry. It fosters a sense of community and\npromotes synergy between university faculty and software industry nationwide.\nIRUS activities provide a natural vehicle for communication and \nexperience sharing, leading to joint community initiatives as well as\nfocused research and development partnerships. IRUS provides organizational \ninfrastructure for the software community to:\n\n<ul>\n<li> Advance the state of software development practices, enabling companies\n     to succeed in the global marketplace\n<li> Improve regional competitiveness through software workforce skill\n     enhancement\n<li> Expedite technology transition of research products into industrial\n     practice and accelerate the rate of absorption by software practitioners \n     of the best new software technologies\n<li> Guide university research and state-of-the-art technology development\n<li> Share and disseminate the best ideas among regional industry leaders\n     through active networking and interaction on key contemporary software \n     issues\n<li> Quantitatively improve the state of the software engineering practice in\n     terms of productivity and overall software quality and dependability\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\nThe foundation of IRUS is the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/software/index.html\">\nsoftware</A> \nfaculty from the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science department</A>\nat the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine.</A>\nThe software faculty and research\nprogram are ranked as one of the best in \nthe world. The software faculty is complemented by several faculty\nmembers from the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/CORPS\">\ncomputing, organizations, policy, and society (CORPS)</A> group. This core \nfaculty has an established track record for working together \nand for obtaining and administering large-scale joint funding. The\nfaculty has also established software-related \nresearch projects in cooperation with local industry. It maintains\nconnections to software research groups else\nwhere in the University of California system, across the country, and\naround the world.\n\n<P>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">Back to the IRUS home page</A>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
