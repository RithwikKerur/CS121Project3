At first he lived in Lubacov (Lubaczow). He then moved to Mudyerotska (Mudjovitz) where he built a beautiful glass and marble house. He even built a glass factory just to make the glass for the house. He came to the US to learn glass making (see Bertha Miller). He also lived in Kvakovitz. Before World War I he moved to Vranov nad Toplou. He had a tremendous estate there, which took several days to traverse on horseback. After World War I it was confiscated. He sent some of his gentile watchman back to the estate but they were murdered. Avrohm had 10 children from his second marriage and at least several were born there.
