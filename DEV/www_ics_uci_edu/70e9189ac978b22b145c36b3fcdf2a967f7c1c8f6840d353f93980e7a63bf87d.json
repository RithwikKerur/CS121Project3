Eventually we reach\na graph formed by a single triangle at which point\nV-E+F=3-3+2=2.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nThe case analysis occurring in higher dimensional\nversions of this proof is closely related to Radon's theorem\nthat any <I>d</I>+2 points can be partitioned into two\nsubsets with intersecting convex hulls,\nand to \"flipping\" based algorithms for constructing\nDelaunay triangulations and convex hulls.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
