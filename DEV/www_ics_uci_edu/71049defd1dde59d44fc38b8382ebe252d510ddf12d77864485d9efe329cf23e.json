Assuming that\nthe homology is defined with integer coefficients, we show the\nfollowing : For a finite simplicial complex $K$ of dimension greater\nthan $p$, the boundary matrix $[\\partial_{p+1}]$ is totally\nunimodular if and only if $H_p(L, L_0)$ is torsion-free, for all pure\nsubcomplexes $L_0, L$ in $K$ of dimensions $p$ and $p+1$\nrespectively, where $L_0$ is a subset of $L$. Because of the total\nunimodularity of the boundary matrix, we can solve the optimization\nproblem, which is inherently an integer programming problem, as a\nlinear program and obtain integer solution. Thus the problem of\nfinding optimal cycles in a given homology class can be solved in\npolynomial time. This result is surprising in the backdrop of a\nrecent result which says that the problem is NP-hard under\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients which, being a field, is in general\neasier to deal with. One consequence of our result, among others, is\nthat one can compute in polynomial time an optimal 2-cycle in a given\nhomology class for any finite simplicial complex embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}^3$. Our optimization approach can also be used for\nvarious related problems, such as finding an optimal chain homologous\nto a given one when these are not cycles.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
