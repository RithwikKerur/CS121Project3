My maternal\r\ngrandfather, Moses (Moishe) Schonfeld, was the 8th of 10 children from\r\nthe second wife, Bayla, of Zvi Elimelech Schonfeld. Zvi had two children\r\nfrom his first wife, she died and he left them with his in-laws in\r\nHungary. Bayla was the sister of the first wife.Since my grandfather was\r\nthe 10th of his 12 children and was born in1867, the older ones would\r\nhave been born in the 1840's and Zvi maybe in the 1820's.Any\r\nconnections?\r\nMarge Schechner\r\nmomcactus@email.com\r\n_____________________________________________________\r\nDate: Fri, 28 Jan 2000 10:22:36 -0500 (EST) \r\nFrom: Marge Schechner &lt;momcactus@email.com> \r\nTo: &quot;moishe@langsam.com&quot; &lt;moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: Schonfeld \r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n I found your page fascinating especially since my mother has\r\n  her grandfather's name as Zvi Elimelech and one of her sister's \r\n  said his name was Hersh Shula and my grandparents had a first \r\n  baby boy who died shortly after birth whose name was Hersh \r\n  Melech. I don't know hi wives maiden names nor his first \r\n  wife's name, just my great grandmother Bayla. Some of your \r\n  dates dont fit if I am estimating my grandfather's birth in \r\n  1867. since he was the 10th if Zvi's children his father had \r\n  to have been born at least 35 when he was born so Zvi would \r\n  have had to be born no later than 1830. Wish I could help \r\n  more. I don't know any of my grandfathers siblings names but \r\n  have several of his niece's and nephew's names and will try \r\n  that route.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarge Schechner\r\n\r\n\r\nI would say most definitely. To tell you where you fit, can you provide \r\neither some of the siblings names or verify that Bayla's maiden name was \r\nKallush? Did he have a sister Sara?

Found out that his name was Hersh \r\nMelech and Hebrew name was Zvi Elimelech which now makes sense \r\nsince the baby who would have been my mother's oldest sibling \r\nwas named Hersh Melech (he died after &quot;a bad bris&quot;)for their \r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nMarge Schechner\r\n\r\nYou wrote:\r\nHi,\r\nSorry for the delay. I will answer the rest of your email shortly. Just one \r\nthing to point out.\r\nHersh Shula is not a name. It must have been Hersh. The phonetic &quot;ula&quot; \r\n&quot;ela&quot;, or &quot;ala&quot; is added at the end of almost any name as a term of \r\nendearment, like Moshela (for Moshe), Chanala (for Chana), etc.\r\n-Moishe\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nDate: Thu, 3 Feb 2000 13:34:33 -0500 (EST) \r\nFrom: Marge Schechner &lt;momcactus@email.com> \r\nTo: &quot;moishe@langsam.com&quot; &lt;moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: Schonfeld \r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n I wish I could help with this one but the only one that I know of is my \r\n grandfather, Moses (Moshe). For some reason,no one in the family knows \r\n the names of any of his siblings, just that Zvi was from Hungary and \r\n born somewhere in the 1820-30 range.Zvi had died by 1896 since the first \r\n child to my grandparents was a boy named Hersh Melech who died shortly \r\n after birth and was born in 1896. I know the names of a few of his \r\n siblings children who were my grandfather's age. One of his siblings \r\n sons(obviously a brother) was Abe Schonfeld who accompanied my grandmother \r\n here in 1912, June or so to New York  and two sisters, Esther Weisman and  \r\n Fannie Goldberg, who were about my grandmother's age so born about 1875 to \r\n another of his siblings but dont know if they were Schoenfelds by maiden \r\n name or not.\r\n\r\nMarge\r\n\r\n\r\nYou wrote:\r\nHi,\r\nCan we start in the beginning? Can you list (in age order?) the children \r\nfrom each of R' Zvi Elimelech's marriages?

Possible, but not likely,unless a lot of them died \r\nin infancy and another was produced in less than a year. I wish I knew.\r\n\r\nMarge\r\n\r\nYou wrote:\r\nHi,\r\nThanks for your response.

It is dated 10/7/21 and has his age as 54, so again birth year \r\n 1867. Been thinking about the famiy story of his being the 8th of 10 children. \r\n We have no proof since he never mentioned names of any of his siblings. There \r\n were at least two since it was his nephew Abe Schoenfeld who accompanied my \r\n grandmother here in 1912 and it was his niece Esther Weisman who he stayed \r\n with in NY while my grandmother was in Europe.\r\nMarge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your response.

Hoping that one of our subscribers has the\r\ncurrent e-mail address for Nathan Rosenshein ....and will forward this\r\nmessage to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Nathan,\r\n\r\n\r\nI finally have definitive knowledge as to how the Schonfeld and Kallush\r\nfamilies are related:\r\n\r\n\r\nRabbi Meshullam Dov Kallush, Dayan (religious court judge) of Munkacs was\r\nthe father-in-law of Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Schonfeld (son of Moshe Schonfeld\r\nand Sara Spira, the daughter of the Bnei Yissaschar). In fact, after Rabbi\r\nZ.E. Schonfeld's zivug rishon (first wife) was niftar (died)her sibling\r\nbecame his sivug sheni (second wife). I have known this for several years.\r\nWhat is new is that Rabbi Meshullam Dov Kallush also had a son Elimelech\r\nKallush who had a son Shalom Kallush (d.1920) who married a daughter of\r\nRabbi Z.E. Schonfeld. Shalom and his wife, nee' Schonfeld had a son BenZion\r\nand a daughter Chaya Breine who married Rabbi Shlomo Eliezer Weisel (he was\r\nRabbi in a town in Maramoresh). Other Kallush offspring are not named here\r\nsince I don't have that information. Hopefully, this will be helpful to you,\r\nand others as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest wishes,\r\n\r\n\r\nLouis Schonfeld\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 2/16/02</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
