Strip packing can be used to model\nscheduling problems in which  tasks require a contiguous\nsubset of identical resources that are arranged in a linear topology.\nThe particular variants  studied here are motivated by \nscheduling tasks for dynamically reconfigurable \nField-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). For the case in which\ntasks have precedence constraints, we give an <I>O</I>(log <I>n</I>)\napproximation, where <I>n</I> is the number of tasks.\nWe also give a 3-approximation for the special case in which\nall the rectangles to be placed have uniform height.\nFor release times, we provide an asymptotic polynomial time \n(1+&epsilon;)-approximation scheme. We make the standard assumption \nthat the rectangles have height at most 1. In addition, we also \nrequire widths to be in (&epsilon<sub><I>n</I></sub>, 1]. Our algorithm runs in time \npolynomial in <I>n</I>, 1/&epsilon;, and 1/&epsilon<sub><I>n</I></sub>.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
