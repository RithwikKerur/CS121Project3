That is, we are given a set of n points whose location we\nonly know approximately, and\nwe maintain a set of n regions whose size depends on the precision of\nthe corresponding point.\nWe support point location queries among these regions and insertions\nand deletions of regions in O(log n) time. We also support local\nupdates to re-size or move a region in sub-logarithmic time. \n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
