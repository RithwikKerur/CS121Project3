Either prove that such a man always exists, or find an example where all men settle for later preferences.</p></li>\n<li><p>Let $n$ be an even number, and form an undirected graph with $n$ vertices numbered from $0$ to $n-1$ by adding edges connecting each vertex numbered $i$ to the three vertices numbered $i-1$, $i+1$, and $i+n/2$ (mod $n$). For instance, when $n$ is four, this graph can be drawn using the sides and diagonals of a square. For which values of $n$ is this graph bipartite? Explain how to find a $2$-coloring of the graph for the values of $n$ that make this graph bipartite, and how to find an odd-length cycle for the values of $n$ that make this graph non-bipartite.</p></li>\n<li><p>Let $G$ be the bipartite graph shown below. Starting from an empty partial matching, find a sequence of alternating paths that leads to a maximum matching in $G$. Choose your alternating paths in such a way that the first one has one edge, the second one has three edges, the third one has five edges, and the fourth one has seven edges. (Hint: it may be easier to solve the problem by working backwards.)</p>\n<p align=center><img src=\"s15-hw7-grid.png\"></p></li>\n<li><p>Let $T$ be a tree with four leaves and two degree-three vertices. Draw a polygon $P$ with axis-parallel sides, such that the vertices of $T$ correspond one-for-one with axis-parallel slices through pairs of $270^\\circ$-vertices of $P$, and such that two vertices of $T$ are adjacent if and only if the corresponding two slices cross or touch each other. Find a partition of your polygon into a minimum number of rectangles, and describe which of the slices in your partition correspond to the vertices of a maximum independent set in $T$.</p></li>\n</ol></body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
