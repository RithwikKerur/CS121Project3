There is no assumption of \nshared address space among components and each \ncomponent may have its own thread(s) of control\n\n<DT> Flexibility \n<DD> Multiple users may be interacting with the \nsystem. Multiple dialogs may be active and \ndescribed in different formalisms. Multiple tool\nkits and media types may be employed. Architec\ntures may be changed dynamically. A conceptual \narchitecture is distinct from an implementation \narchitecture; multiple implementation architectures \nmay realize the same conceptual architecture.\n</DL>\n\n<IMG SRC=\"c2arch.gif\">\n\n<H3>Chiron-2 composition rules</H3>\nThere are two types \nof building blocks in Chiron-2: components and \nconnectors, i.e., message routing devices. A Chiron-2 \narchitecture can informally be described as a network \nof concurrent components linked together by connectors. \nComponents and connectors both have a defined \ntop and bottom. They may be composed in the follow\ning manner:\n\n<UL>\n<LI> The top of a component may be connected to the \nbottom of a single connector. \n\n<LI> The bottom of a component may be connected to \nthe top of a single connector. \n\n<LI> There is no bound on the number of components \nor connectors that may be attached to a single connector. \n\n<LI> When two connectors are attached to each other, it \nmust be from the bottom of one to the top of the other.\n</UL>\n\n<P>\n<H3>Chiron-2 Communication Rules</H3> \nAll communication \nbetween Chiron-2 components is achieved \nsolely by exchanging messages. Each component has \na top and bottom domain. The top domain specifies \nthe set of notifications to which a component \nresponds, and the set of requests it emits up an \narchitecture. The bottom domain specifies the set of \nnotifications that a component emits down an architecture \nand the set of requests to which it responds. Central to \nthe architectural style is a principle of limited visibility \nor substrate independence: a component within the \nhierarchy can only be aware of components \"above\"\nit, and is completely unaware of the components \n\"beneath\" it. \n\n<P>\n\n<H3>Benefits of Chiron-2</H3>\nIt is a \"natural\" architectural \nstyle for user interface software, where application \narchitecture is unconstrained by the user \ninterface architecture. The style has a simple and \nunderstandable set of rules that support\n\n<UL>\n<LI> scalability,\n<LI> distributed, multi-user applications,\n<LI> flexibility and customizability,\n<LI> component substitutability, and\n<LI> efficiency by separating conceptual architectures from implementation architectures.\n</UL>\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<H2>Chiron-2 Example Architectures</H2>\n<A HREF=\"klax.ps\"> KLAX Example </A>\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<H2>Chiron-2 Papers</H2>\n<A HREF=\"copyright_page.html\">\n\"<b>A Component- and Message-Based Architectural Style for GUI\nSoftware</b>\"</A>,\nby Richard N.
