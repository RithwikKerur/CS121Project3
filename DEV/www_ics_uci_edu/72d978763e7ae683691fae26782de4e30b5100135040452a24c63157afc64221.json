In addition there\nare four discussion sections.\nStudents are expected\nto be enrolled in one of the discussion sections and to attend\ndiscussions regularly. We will not be taking attendance, and it is ok to attend a different discussion than the one you are enrolled in as long as space permits. At the discussion sections, the teaching assistant will go over homework and midterm\nsolutions, give additional examples of topics covered in the lecture,\nand be available to answer questions.</p>\n\n<p>There is an online forum at Piazza (search for CS161). Lecture materials will not be distributed to the class; instead, you are encouraged to attend the lecture yourself and take your own notes. Recording the lectures for your own personal use, and sharing your materials with other students in the class is allowed, but other uses of recorded lectures (including making them available online) is forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>The course text will be \"Algorithm Design and Applications\" by\nGoodrich and Tamassia (Wiley, 2015). Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks (typically due on Fridays and posted on this page before the start of class on Monday of the week it is due)\nas well as two midterms and a comprehensive final exam. The overall\ngrade will be determined 10% from homework, 25% from each midterm, and\n40% from the final. Homeworks will be graded 50% for effort,\n50% for correctness on one of the assigned problems (chosen arbitrarily\nfrom each problem set).</p>\n\n<p>Homeworks should be turned in through GradeScope. Group work on\nhomeworks is permitted; however, each student\nshould turn in his or her own copy of the homeworks. Some of the\nhomework problems will ask you to perform calculations or trace the\nsteps of an algorithm; you are welcome to use computer programs\nto solve these problems rather than doing everything by hand.\nEach week's\nhomework assignment will be given on this web page. Homework is due by\n9:00pm on Fridays and must be turned in through dropbox\non eee. No late\nhomework will be accepted.\nStudents who add the class after the start of quarter will be\nresponsible for turning in all earlier homeworks by the following\nFriday. The lowest homework score of the quarter will be dropped from\nthe course average.</p>\n\n<h2>Tentative Schedule</h2>\n\n<dl>\n<dt>Week 1: Introduction; data structures</dt>\n<dd>Intro/review [Goodrich & Tamassia, chapter 1]; Fibonacci numbers (Chapter 12)</dd>\n<dd>Priority queues and heapsort (Chapter 5)</dd>\n<dd>Hashing with linear probing (Chapter 6)</dd>\n<dd>Homework 1, due Friday, April 12: R-1.3, R-1.7, C-5.8, R-6.5.</dd>\n\n<dt>Week 2: Comparison sorting</dt>\n<dd>Merge sort, divide-and-conquer, and the master theorem\n(Chapters 8 and 11)</dd>\n<dd>Comparison sorting lower bounds (Chapter 8)</dd>\n<dd>Quick sort (Chapter 8)</dd>\n<dd>Homework 2, due Friday, April 19: R-8.5, C-8.9, R-11.1, C-11.3.</dd>\n\n<dt>Week 3: Selection and integer sorting</dt>\n<dd>Quickselect (Chapter 9)</dd>\n<dd>Bucket sort and stability (Chapter 9)</dd>\n<dd>Radix sort (Chapter 9)</dd>\n<dd>Homework 3, due Friday, April 26: R-9.1, R-9.5, C-9.2, C-9.4.
