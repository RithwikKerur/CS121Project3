On the other hand, working in the lab has some genuine benefits, particularly for those of you who are fairly new to programming and/or fairly new to UCI.  In the lab, you'll find that help is more readily available when you get stuck, that your machine setup will generally be stable and designed well for the task of working on your assignments, and that you're free from the distractions of your home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, we're aware that many of you, either out of want or need, will choose to do some percentage of your work on your own machines.  What follows is enough information to turn your Windows-based or Macintosh computer into a Java development environment, including Eclipse, at little or no cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>What's in this document?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you get started, be aware that this document only describes how to set up Java and Eclipse on a computer running Windows or Mac OS X.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Linux or Solaris, JDK 6 Update 24 can be downloaded from <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\">Java SE Downloads</a>, the same way it can for Windows; we do not discuss the details of installation here, though there is ample documentation available on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The document is broken into separate sections detailing how to install Java and Eclipse on Windows and on Mac OS X; these sections follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Setting up Java on Windows</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What you'll need to get started is a Java compiler and Java virtual machine, both of which must support Java 6.  A great option is to download the Java SE 6 JDK (JDK 6) from <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\">Java SE Downloads</a>, the latest version of which, as of this writing, is JDK 6 Update 24.  (Just click on the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Download JDK</font> button and follow the instructions.) The download is free!  Be sure you download the JDK and <i>not</i> the JRE!  The JDK includes a Java compiler (<font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font>), a Java virtual machine (<font class = \"codefacesmall\">java</font>), and all of the standard Java library components &mdash; in other words, everything you need to write Java programs in a wide variety of problem domains, and more than enough firepower for the assignments we'll be giving you.  (The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment, which includes the necessary code to allow you to <i>run</i> Java programs, but not to write and compile them!)</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Installation: the easy part</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The JDK includes an installation program, which places all of the files into the appropriate places and sets up some desktop shortcuts for you.  However, after running the installation program, you still won't be able to execute <b>javac</b> or <b>java</b>, without making a couple of modifications \"under the hood\" of your system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked what folder you should install the JDK into, the default will be:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nC:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.6.0_24\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>I suggest changing it to the following folder instead:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nC:\\jdk1.6.0_24\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason for this suggestion is that the next steps in the installation process will be simpler if the folder you choose has a shorter name that, importantly, <i>has no spaces in it</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The (not all that) hard part: PATH and CLASSPATH</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can execute programs from a command prompt by simply typing their names, such as <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font> or <font class = \"codefacesmall\">java</font>.  But there's a catch: Windows has to know where it can <i>find</i> these programs.  This is the job of the <b>PATH</b> environment variable.  Whenever you try to execute a program, Windows will look for it in the list of folders in the PATH. Each folder in the PATH list is separated from the next by a semicolon; <i>forgetting or misplacing semicolons is a major cause of the PATH not finding javac or java</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, whenever the Java compiler or Java virtual machine need to be able to use a Java class (such as when you import a class from the Java library), the compiler or virtual machine needs to be able to know where to find it.  This is the job of the <b>CLASSPATH</b> environment variable.  CLASSPATH is a list of folders, separated by semicolons, in which the Java compiler or virtual machine will look for a Java class whenever it's trying to find one. <i>Forgetting or misplacing semicolons is a major cause of the CLASSPATH not finding clases your program needs</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to make the JDK work, you have to modify the PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables on your system, so that Windows will be able to find <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font> and <font class = \"codefacesmall\">java</font>, and so that <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font> and <font class = \"codefacesmall\">java</font> will be able to find all of the necessary Java classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How you get to these environment variables is slightly different on different versions of Windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>On Windows 7 and Vista</i>, click the start orb in the lower-left corner of the screen, move your mouse over <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Computer</font>, right-click, and select <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Properties</font> from the pop-up menu.  Click the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Advanced System Settings</font> link, then click the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Environment Variables...</font> button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>On Windows XP and 2000</i>, right-click the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">My Computer</font> icon on your desktop and select <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Properties</font>.  Select the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Advanced</font> tab.  Click the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Environment Variables...</font> button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you've brought up the environment variables, find the PATH variable listed under \"System variables\" and add this to the <i>end</i> of it:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n;C:\\jdk1.6.0_24\\bin\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Then find the CLASSPATH variable.  If it doesn't exist (and it probably won't, if you've never used your system to develop Java code), click the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">New...</font> button, specifying CLASSPATH as its name, and the following value:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n.;C:\\jdk1.6.0_24\\lib\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're using <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font> and <font class = \"codefacesmall\">java</font> from the command line, you will need to bring up a new Command Prompt window, in order for these changes to take effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>That's it!</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, your Java installation is ready to go; you're now ready to proceed to installing Eclipse.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Setting up Eclipse on Windows</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Downloading Eclipse</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several different distirbutions of Eclipse available for download at <a href=\"http://eclipse.org/\">eclipse.org</a>, each geared toward users with different kinds of needs: Java programming, web development, and so on.  So the first thing to know is which distribution to download.  For our work in this course, I'm expecting you to use <b>Eclipse Classic 3.6.2</b>.  Start by downloading this; be sure that you get the Windows version and not a version intended for a different operating system.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Installing Eclipse</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Eclipse is distributed as files in a Zip archive and, unlike most software you install on Windows, has no installation program.  Instead, you'll need to do a few things on your own in order to get it installed.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Find the <b>.zip</b> file that you downloaded using Windows Explorer (or on your desktop, if you saved it there).  Extract it to <b>C:\\eclipse</b>, or somewhere else you feel comfortable putting it.  (On Windows XP and later, you can extract it by right-clicking on it and selecting <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Extract All</font>.)  The extraction process is likely to take a while &mdash; several minutes or more is not uncommon.</li>\r\n\r\n  <li>Once you've extracted Eclipse into a folder, go into that folder using Windows Explorer.  Find the file <font class = \"codefacesmall\">eclipse.exe</font> &mdash; it may show up as <font class = \"codefacesmall\">eclipse</font> if you have Windows Explorer configured to hide file extension, but you can recognize it because its icon will be the circular purple logo you see at <a href=\"http://eclipse.org/\">eclipse.org</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>From here, your next step depends on which version of Windows you're running.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>On Windows 2000, XP, and Vista</i>.  Right-click on the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">eclipse.exe</font> file you found, select <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Create Shortcut</font> to create a shortcut to allow you to run Eclipse.  Drag this shortcut to your desktop or Quick Launch bar.  You can then use this shortcut to open Eclipse any time you'd like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>On Windows 7</i>.  Double-click on <font class = \"codefacesmall\">eclipse.exe</font> to start Eclipse.  When asked for a workspace, use the default for now.  Once the program starts, you'll see the Eclipse icon show up on your taskbar.  Right-click that icon and select <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Pin this program to taskbar</font>, so that you'll be able to run Eclipse any time you'd like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's it!  Eclipse is installed and ready to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Setting up Java on Mac OS X</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Getting started</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I'll assume that you're running at least version 10.5 of Mac OS X on a 64-bit Mac.  (On Mac OS X, you can find your version number by selecting <font class = \"codefacesmall\">About This Mac</font> under the apple menu.)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 can be updated to the most recent version of Java through the regular Software Updates feature of Mac OS X.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Checking if you have the latest version installed and selected as default</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The first thing you should do is to check if you have the latest version of Java installed.  To do so, first open a new Terminal window (by command-N or choosing New Shell on the File menu); then type the following command:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    java -version\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have the latest version of Java installed, you should see something like the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n    java version \"1.6.0_24\"\r\n\tJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_24-b04-307-9M3263)\r\n\tJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.1-b03-307, mixed mode)\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If you see that the version number starts with \"1.6,\" you're in business!  Your machine is ready to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you see a version number that starts with something other than \"1.6\" (like \"1.5\" or \"1.4\"), you'll need to continue following these instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Checking what version of Java is the default on your machine</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mac OS X is perfectly happy to let different versions of Java coexist on your machine; installing a newer version of Java doesn't remove any earlier versions and doesn't even make the newer version the default Java on your machine.  So, the next step is to see if the latest Java is installed but is not the default.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launch <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Applications</font>, then select <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Utilities</font>, then <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Java</font>, then <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Java Preferences</font>.  Click on the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">General</font> tab, if it's not already selected.  In the Java Application Runtime Settings box, see if Java SE 6 (64 bit) is in the list; if so, drag it to the top of the list, making sure that it is the first item.  <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Close</font> the dialog box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Java SE 6 (64 bit) is not in the list at all, you'll need to download the latest version of Java from <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/java/\">this link</a> and install it, then follow these instructions again to make it the default version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you've set Java SE 6 (64 bit) as your default version of Java, run the instructions in the section titled \"Checking if you have the latest version installed and selected as default\" to verify that the appropriate changes have been made and the latest version of Java is installed and selected as your default installation of Java.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What else you'll need to know</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're used to the Mac environment and not used to Unix or other command-line processing systems, you'll want to learn at least a little Unix so you can find your way around.</p>\r\n\r\n<h1>Setting up Eclipse on Mac OS X</h1>\r\n\r\n<h2>Determining which version of Eclipse is right for you</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two separate downloads of Eclipse Classic 3.6.2 for Mac OS X on the main download page.  The first thing you need to decide is which one of them is right for your machine, which requires you to distinguish between \"32-bit\" and \"64-bit\".</p>\r\n\r\n\"Cocoa\" is the current developer programming environment for the Mac.  It's used in Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6, and versions of it go back to the first days of Mac OS X. It is available for both 64-bit (decent) and 32-bit (old) Mac OS X enviroments.\r\n(On another download page, Eclipse also makes available a downolad for \"Carbon,\" an much older environment that is not fully compatible with modren Macs.)</\r\nAssuming you have a relatively modern Mac, you'll want the 64-bit installation of Eclipse Classic 3.6.2</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Installing Eclipse on Mac OS X</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To install the 64-bit Cocoa version of Eclipse Classic 3.6.2:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Go to <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>.</li>\r\n  <li>Under the last entry, Eclipse Classic 3.6.2, click on <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Mac OS X 64-Bit</font>.</li>\r\n  <li>Click on the main or a mirror download site.  Choose <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Save File</font> in the dialog box that appears and click <font class = \"codefacesmall\">OK</font>.</li>\r\n  <li>The file will download &mdash; this may take a few minutes.</li>\r\n\r\n  <li>Double-click on the resulting .gz file to unzip and untar it.  The result will be a folder called \"eclipse\".  This, too, can take a few to several minutes.</li>\r\n  <li>To run Eclipse, open the \"eclipse\" folder and double-click on the Eclipse icon (not the \"eclipse\" &mdash; note lower-case &mdash; shortcut).  On first launch, a dialog box might appear asking if you're sure you want to launch; say yes.  After a minute or two, a dialog will ask you to select a workspace, at which time you'll be ready to use Eclipse!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\r\n    <ul class=\"nomarker\">\r\n        <li>Imported from Eric Hennigan's ICS 22 which was in turn adapted from Alex Thornton's version which he\r\n    developed over many years.</li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n    <div id=\"footer\">\r\n    </div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\u0000", "encoding": "ascii"}
