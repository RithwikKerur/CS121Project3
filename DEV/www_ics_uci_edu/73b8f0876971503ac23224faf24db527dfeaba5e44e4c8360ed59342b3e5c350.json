The mailing list is the final\narbiter of consensus on any issue.  Note also, that the revised\nBindings Protocol specification produced as a result of this\nconference call will also be subject to review by the mailing\nlist. ***\n\nWe will march through the issues in order (from the issues list Judy\nput together).\n\nIssue #1 (Weak bindings): Short answer: no weak bindings.  Some\nrationale: We have discussed, and rejected this opion before.  A\nstrong bindings spec. stands on its own, while weak bindings need\nstrong bindings.  Also, redirect references give you some of the\nfunctionalty of weak bindings.\n\nIssue #2 (Security and DAVbindings property): No matter how we decide\nthis issue, will still need to discuss this issue in the security\nconsiderations section.  Agreement that this sounds like a server\nimplementation policy issue, and hence should not be turned into a\nnormative requirement.  However, language should be added to the\nspec., in the Security Considerations section, stating that this\npolicy can be implemented by servers.\n\nIssue #3 (DAV:resourceid for versioned resources): Language addressing\nthis issue has been added to the Delta-V versioning protocol\nspecification, and hence will not be addressed in the bindings\nprotocol.\n\nIssue #4 (PublishBind): Will not explicitly reference the other\nadvanced collection specs., esp. Ordered Collections, but will mention\nthat Redirect References, which do not have strong integrity, are\ndefined in another specification (without directly referencing that\nspec.)\n\nIssue #5 (We Screwed Up): We will move this text to the appendix, and\ncomb through the text for mentions of internal member URIs.\n\nIssue #6 (4Huh?): Agreement that section 4 will be deleted.\nParagraphs within section 4 that introduce new material will be rolled\ninto either the Introduction, or the terminology section. This means\nthat the first paragraph will be deleted, and the other paragraphs\nwill be moved. Paragraph on \"bindings are not unique to advanced\ncollections\" --> move to introduction. Paragraphs 3 & 4 are moved to a\nnew section on integrity of bindings.\n\nAlso agreed that there should be a new section explicitly addressing\nintegrity of bindings.\n\nIssue #7 (5.3 Huh?): Agreed to take a stab at writing it in set\nnotation.  Geoff bravely volunteered for this task.  Will revisit this\nsection once it has been converted into set notation.\n\nIssue #8 (5.4Huh): If you don't understand 5.3, won't understand this\neither. Revisit once 5.3 is rewritten.\n\nIssue #9 (507): Agreed to use 403 instead of 507 and reword to just be\ngenerically that the binding was refused, and to create a new 4xx code\nfor the loop forbidden condition. (This addresses issue #15)\n\nIssue #10 (2616Insulting): We will delete the last three sentences of\nfirst paragraph of section 6, and accept Roy Fielding's wording\nsuggestion for replacement text.\n\nIssue #11 (AtomicDelete): Discussed, but did not come to any\nconclusions.  Agreed to invite Yaron to a future conference call to\nfurther discuss this issue.\n\nIssue #12 (AtomicMove): Tentatively agreed that move should be atomic.\n\nGeoff Clemm left the conference call at this point.\n\nIssue #13 (NoSlash): No agreement.\n\nIssue #14 (BindSyntax): Agreement that we will revert back to the\nprevious syntax for Bind, used in either the -00 or the -01 version of\nthe spec.\n\nIssue #15 was handled above in Issue #9.\n\nIssue #16 (ApplePie): Agreed to delete this sentence (\"After\nsuccessful ...\").\n\nIssue #17 (ApplePieToo): Agreed that we want feedback from the list on\nthe two suggestions given in Judy's post of Jan 19:\nhttp://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/2000JanMar/0109.html\n\nIssue #18 (ApplePie3): Agreed to accept a close variation of Yaron's\nproposed language. Also agreed not to mention anything about weak\nbindings, since they are an abstraction not defined in this\nspecification.  May also have to change the definition of the\ndav:bindings property (need to check this).\n\nIssue #23: (Don't paginate): We will continue to follow IETF procedure\nand paginate.  We will endeavor to produce an alternative, nicely\nformatted version of the draft for review as well.\n\n*** End of teleconference ***\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
