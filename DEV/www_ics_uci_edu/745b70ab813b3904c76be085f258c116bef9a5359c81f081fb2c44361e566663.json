I have never met my grandfather, he died before I \r\nwas born, but I am told that he was a Jew, and his father was sending (stowing \r\naway) a child or two every year to America as he could afford it. I know that my\r\ngrandfather was one of seven including a pair of identical twins who never made \r\nit to the West. He had a grandmother named Abraham Mueller, I believe. They \r\nsupposedly came from a town whose name when translated means &quot;Jewtown&quot;.\r\nDo I need much more information?\r\nThanks, \r\nJeffrey Miller\r\nnucomm@ix.netcom.com\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<HR WIDTH=\"450\" COLOR=\"MAROON\" ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\r\n<LI>\r\n<A NAME=\"gac\"></A><br>\r\n<A HREF=\"#top\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0 ALT=\"Top\" ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"></A>\r\n<PRE>\r\nAuthor:  etarnove@connectnet.com (Liz Tarnove) at INTERNET\r\nDate:    4/23/97  8:03 PM\r\nPriority: Normal\r\nTO: Moishe Miller at CC_NYP5W1\r\nSubject: Millers????\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\nI'm researching my family tree and found your page.

My mother's maternal grandfather was named \r\nJohann Mu&quot;ller and was born in Deckendorf (Deggendorf), in Lower \r\nBavaria (where the Isar and the Donau meet -- the Isar is the little \r\nriver flowing through Mu&quot;nchen (Munich) that people ride flat log-rafts \r\non in the summer and the Donau is the Danube).   He was born\r\nFeb 12, 1860 and came to Pittsburgh in 1881.  He had a rule that only \r\nGerman was to be spoken in the house and after having been in America \r\nfor 19 years (according to the 1900 census) he was still not a US \r\ncitizen while his wife was.  Perhaps he could not or would not learn \r\nEnglish, which was required for naturalization.  But he later got\r\nhis citizenship and from then on, conscientiously voted in every \r\nelection.  The polling places back then were always in barber shops \r\naccording to my Gramma because women were not yet allowed to vote.\r\n     \r\nHis wife, whose maiden name was Meder, was from extreme eastern Slovakia \r\nand was born near Kaschau (Kosice, Kassa).  Family stories say she had \r\nsisters but I don't know if they came to America or stayed in Slovakia. \r\nTheir names are supposed to have been Nora, Leah, and Anna.  (Her name was \r\nMaria.)     \r\n     \r\nRegards,\r\nCecelia\r\n     \r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------ \r\nCecelia Clancy               regular e-mail     cacst9+@pitt.edu \r\n424 S.

He was a tailor. Within a few \r\nyears after settling in Fall River he moved to Newport \r\nRhode Island where he worked for the Army at Fort Adams.\r\n     \r\nHe was very active in the Jewish Community in Newport. \r\nI have a copy of his emigration permit which was signed \r\nby the King of Prussia. I know he had a strong German \r\nbackground and I suspect the what was then Prussia is\r\nprobably now within the current boarders of modern Germany.\r\n     \r\nMy father told me that upon ariving on a boat in Newport \r\nHarbor he had some difficulty getting though the authorities \r\nin the U. S. and managed to &quot;jump ship&quot; and avoid the \r\nadministrative delays.\r\n     \r\nCan you give me any suggestions how I might proceed to get \r\nmore information. My grandfather died during the early \r\n1950's. He had sister who also settled in New England.

I \r\nbelieve we corresponded by snail mail some time ago.  Since then, I have done \r\nsome more research, but don't know whether or not it will help us make a \r\nconnection.  As for your note regarding translating material about Munkacs, \r\nthat is not part of the Miller family.  The Miller family is my husband's \r\nside and the Munkacs people are on my side.\r\n     \r\nFirst the Miller family:  Chaim (Hyman) Miller lists his birthplace as both \r\nMaciow (ship manifest) and Wolza (naturalization).  He was orphaned as a \r\nchild and grew up in the family of the woman he married Feige (Fanny) Bieber \r\nfrom Kovel.  They lived in Kovel before emigrating to the US, Chaim in1907 \r\nand Feige with child Nate age 5 in 1911.  There was another older male child \r\nwho died in a fire in Kovel prior to their emigration.  Chaim's (b 1878) was \r\nthe son of Natan Nuta.  He had a brother Hirsch (Harry) Miller who was born \r\nin Triesk (Manifest).  Unfortunately, that is all we know regarding the &quot;old \r\ncountry&quot;.  A search from JGFF revealed that you are also researching Miller \r\nfrom Maciejowa and was wondering if that could be the same town as Maciow and \r\na possible connection.\r\n     \r\nSecond, Munkacs: The family names I am researching from this city are GROSS \r\nand EISDORFER.  I have a copy of the Munkacs chapter from Arim ve-Immahot \r\nbe-Yisrael (Jewish Mother Cities) ed. Ha-Cohen Fishman 1946.  If you are not \r\nfamiliar with this work and willing to summarize/translate I can send you a \r\ncopy.  If you have already seen it, I would greatly appreciate your sharing.\r\n It is about 20 pages of small Hebrew text, no vowels.\r\n     \r\nI hope we can help each other out.  Please use this e-mail address \r\nrmiller871@aol.com instead of the one at Dowling.  Thank you.\r\n     \r\nRhoda Miller\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<HR WIDTH=\"450\" COLOR=\"MAROON\" ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\r\n<LI>\r\n<A NAME=\"aaron-david\"></A><br>\r\n<A HREF=\"#top\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0 ALT=\"Top\" ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"></A>\r\n<PRE>\r\nAuthor:  pklein@stratos.net at INTERNET\r\nDate:    8/18/96  10:31 AM\r\nPriority: Normal\r\nTO: Moishe Miller at CC_NYP5W1\r\nSubject: re:miller\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\nJust looked at your Miller page. It always seemed like such a common \r\nname that it was maybe not worth the effort of researching, but...\r\n     \r\nmy great-grandfather, aaron david muller, was born in Ivanovo/Janowa, \r\nnot far from Pinsk. his father was Solomon Muller, who died in December \r\n1926, probably in Pinsk. AD was born in 1883, so Solomon is probably \r\naround the 1850s. we always thought the name was miller until i looked \r\nat the passenger list. there, another surprise was that his US sponsor \r\nwas an uncle, S. Schwartz, in brooklyn. AD's mother was Ida Matizansky, \r\nwho survived Sol, but there's no further info. There also might have \r\nbeen a sis (AD's) named Yentl. this assumption is based on a photo with \r\na yiddish inscription.\r\n     \r\nThat's all i know about the Mullers.\r\n     \r\nI do know the town of Lenartov, though, since my Frankel family was from \r\nthere. I recall seeing the name Lauer in the Slovak vitals for that \r\narea.\r\n     \r\nGood searching!\r\n     \r\npaul klein\r\n</PRE>\r\n<HR WIDTH=\"450\" COLOR=\"MAROON\" ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\r\n<LI>\r\n<A NAME=\"Reuben\"></A><br>\r\n<A HREF=\"#top\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0 ALT=\"Top\" ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"></A>\r\n<PRE>\r\nAuthor:  Michael Jesse Chonoles &lt;chonoles.michael@acc.mds.lmco.com&gt; at INTERNET\r\nDate:    8/28/96  10:49 PM\r\nPriority: Normal\r\nTO: Moishe Miller at CC_NYP5W1\r\nSubject: Re: Miller's\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\n--- On Wed, 28 Aug 1996 17:53:35 -0400  moishe_miller@ccmail.prusec.com \r\nwrote:\r\n     \r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;Hi,\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Off hand no, but perhaps you can list the siblings of Morris (Yidel Moshe)?\r\n     \r\nI wish I could, I only know about his descendants.

You are so lucky to have\r\nthose wonderful photos! I did not see any names that were familiar to me\r\nexcept the children of Shlomo of Galicia. I noticed that there were no\r\nnames specifically from Dobromil or Przemsyl. Do you have any information\r\nabout the Miller's from there yet?\r\n     \r\nMy information is sparse to say the least. Most of what I know about\r\nthe Millers in Dobromil comes from their yizkor book. Hersch Melamed\r\nwas the grandfather of Elie (Alex) Mehler. Alex was born in 1896. His\r\nfather Mordecai died in Dobromil in 1900. His mother Roizaly (Rosa) was\r\nmy gr-grandmother's sister. She was born in 1875. I gave you Alex's\r\nsiblings names in my last post. A brother, Hersch married one of my\r\ngrandmother's sisters, Baila Gross, from Przemsyl. She was his first\r\ncousin. The Gross family was a very large one.\r\n\r\nThe name on their ships passenger list was Mehler, but was always\r\nMiller, in the states. My husband and I were living in Ukraine for\r\n9 months this past year. I was able to visit many of my ancestral\r\nshtetls including Przemsyl and Dobromil. If it isn't too much trouble,\r\ncould you please check to see if you have any information about this\r\nfamily.\r\n     \r\nMany thanks,\r\nSandi Goldsmith\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<HR WIDTH=\"450\" COLOR=\"MAROON\" ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\r\n<LI>\r\n<A NAME=\"Jonah\"></A><br>\r\n<A HREF=\"#top\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0 ALT=\"Top\" ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"></A>\r\n<PRE>\r\nAuthor:  NJReady@aol.com at INTERNET\r\nDate:    10/1/96  7:04 PM\r\nPriority: Normal\r\nTO: Moishe Miller at CC_NYP5W1\r\nSubject: Re: Muller\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\nDear Moishe,\r\n     \r\nThe Muller branch of my family goes back to Jonah Muller who married Rivka \r\nWiesel of Sighet, Romania early in the 20th century.\r\n     \r\nRivka's brother was the father of Eli Wiesel, the well-known author.\r\n     \r\nJonah &amp; Rivka had at least 3 children - Helene, Alter, and Zivya.\r\n     \r\nHelene Muller married Moshe Herskovits of Ganech, Czechoslovakia.

She alwas said she was from Kieva \r\nGubernya.\r\nShe had two brothers that I was aware of.  One, Sam, resided in Philadelphia.\r\n I am now in the process of tracing his daughter's family.  I know of no\r\nother of his.\r\n  There was another brother who I was told lived in Tallahassee,Fla.  Don't\r\nknow his name.\r\n     \r\n   On my father's side, his maternal grandparents were Millers---Joseph and\r\nRivka.  The family was from Austria-Hungary. For the most part my father's \r\nimmediate family was from Galicia.  My father was born in Tarnapol. \r\nOther names:\r\nMaternal--Strakoffsky\r\nPaternal-- Lorber, Heller, Weintraub\r\n\r\nIf there is any connection E-mail     AGloger@aol.com        Thanks\r\n\r\nAuthor:  AGloger@aol.com at INTERNET\r\nDate:    1/22/97  3:49 PM\r\nPriority: Normal\r\nTO: Moishe Miller at CC_NYP5W1\r\nSubject: Re: Miller Family\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\nIn a message dated 97-01-22 11:25:40 EST, you write:\r\n     \r\n&lt;&lt;   I do have a potential connection for your maternal side with another \r\n      family. Let me go through some of the old Email that I have received \r\n      to try and find it.\r\n     \r\n              On my maternal side, I have little info.  All I know is:\r\n                  Nachum Miller married?  3 children that I know of\r\n--Pauline(dob 1876) (Chai Perel), \r\n                  Sam and another son.  Don't know if there were more\r\nchildren.\r\n                  Pauline married Moishe Strakoffsky.  His parents were Ita\r\nRiya      \r\n                  Leiberman and Yosef Strakoffsky. Moishe had brothers, Sam,\r\nJack( who settled in Leeds, Eng and changed his name to Jack Stratton.)  We \r\nrecently found is decendants.\r\n                Sam Miller married,  I am only aware of one of his children,\r\nCelia, who married William Neistadt.  They are still in Philadelphia.\r\n                As stated, they were  from Kieva Gubernya.  They were\r\nTeteiver. Was there a city in the Gubernya called Teteiv?\r\n     \r\n      Can you give more details regarding your paternal Austro-Hungarian \r\n      side? Dates? Specific cities? Any other generations? This sounds like \r\n      a more promising area for us.\r\n      May I add your Email to my &quot;unkown trees&quot; list on my site? &gt;&gt;\r\n     \r\n                 Paternal family--also little known. (I got a little confused\r\nin my e-mail to you.)\r\n                 Rivka (Rebecca)Miller married Josef Lorber.  They had a\r\ndaughter(my grandmother)Sara Golda(dob 1874) who married Anshel(Arnold) \r\nWeintraub (dob1876. There was also a son.  I believe his name  was Anton (?)\r\n He survived WWll . My father found his in Zagreb.\r\n               I only remember my father saying that his grandparents(Rivka &amp;\r\nJosef) were well off and lived in Vienna.  The last time he saw them was when \r\nhe and his family came to Cleveland in 1922.  My father was then 15 yrs.\r\n             My father's passport and naturalization papers state placeof\r\nbirth was Tarnopol, Poland.  I know he was born in Galicia and that after WWl \r\nit became Poland.  I'm not sure if the family was from the city of Tarnopol \r\nor the province.  I remember him saying something about the exact place \r\nshortly before he died in 1992.  \r\n        I only started looking into family hx in Oct. 1996.  I still have a\r\nlot of digging to do, but am watching message boards,etc and making \r\ninquiries.  Would appreciate any leads.

I linked to your wonderful home page via the Jewish Gen Family \r\nFinder.  I have gotten interested in tracing my roots over the last few \r\nmonths, and have started to collect some good information.  \r\n     \r\n    My great grandfather, Morris Miller, had a brother named Simon, and \r\nthey originally lived on the easter shore of Maryland, in Pocomoke City. \r\n They each married a daughter of the KLAFF family, of which there is an \r\nentire published history.  Morris died in  1959, in Baltimore.  He had \r\nleft Pocomoke in the early part of the century, buying a farm in \r\nReisterstown Maryland, the house still standing to this day.  I recently \r\ncorresponded with a John Miller, also living in Maryland, and it turns \r\nout we are related.  John says his grandfather A.J. was helped to this \r\ncountry by Morris, who was his uncle.  He does not know the name of \r\nA.J.'s father, who I guess would be Morris's brother.  A.J. is buried in \r\nCalif. I believe.\r\n     \r\n   If any of this is relevant or familiar to you, I would love to hear \r\nit.  Thank you for your wonderful home page, and I hope we find a \r\nconnection.\r\n     \r\nMichael\r\n_________________________\r\nAuthor:  levy1@erols.com at INTERNET\r\nDate:    9/26/97  12:03 PM\r\nPriority: Normal\r\nTO: Moishe Miller at CCSP27B1\r\nSubject: The Miller Family\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\nGood morning Moishe,\r\n  I believe I wrote to once before, but do not remember the reply.

Anyway, perhaps \r\nyou can post this information for me:\r\n     \r\nMy maternal grandmother's name was Ida Miller.  She was one of thirteen \r\nchildren of Jacob Miller and Zecil Hartman.  They came from Austria-Hungary \r\n(now Ukraine) and I'm pretty sure they came from the town of Tysmenitsa. \r\nTheir children who survived childhood were Huna (called Max, b abt 1887, \r\nmarried Gussie Steinberg in Europe), Jossel (b after 1887, married Anna \r\nGelder in NYC), Raiza (b after 1887), Sarah (b after 1887, never married), \r\nIda (b 1892, married Samuel Reiter in NYC), and Evelyn (b after 1892, \r\nmarried Nathan Stern in NYC).  All the children lived in Brooklyn.  They \r\nemigrated to the US between 1906 and about 1913.

My maternal grandmother's \r\nmaiden name was Ida (I noticed several Ita's in your tree.  Could this be \r\nthe same name?) Miller.  She was born in Galicia in 1892.  I believe she \r\nlived in or near Tysmenitsa, which was part of Austria-Hungary and is now \r\nin the western Ukraine, near Ivano-Frankovsk.  Her parents were Jacob \r\n(Yacov) Miller and Zecil Hartman (Hertzman?).  The names of her siblings \r\nwho survived childhood were Huna (pronounced Choona), also called Max, Joe, \r\nRaiza, Sarah, and Evelyn.  If I understand your tree correctly, Chaim Leib \r\n(1763-1866) was a Miller from Galicia who had a son Yacov whose age could \r\nmatch that of my great-grandfather Yacov.

My grandfather's name was Volfe Sisel Miller \r\n(we knew him as Velvl). He was born in 1889 and died in 1980. His parents \r\nwere Lieb (Labe?) Miller, and Rivka Bakatursky Miller, from a town near \r\nVilna, Lithuania. At some point they moved to Poland, near Warsaw. I am \r\ntrying to find the name of the town, but I don't have it yet. His family were \r\nCohanim.\r\n     \r\n My grandfather came to the U.S. around 1905 at age16. He was sent by his\r\nparents, aboard a ship which went first to England and then to the U.S. He \r\nhad an uncle in New York named Morris Anderman who he found, but later lost \r\ntrack of. My grandfather was one of 12 siblings. The only one whose name I \r\nknow is Gershon, and he may have gone to Israel. I am just beginning my \r\nresearch and would appreciate any information you might have.\r\n     \r\nMy grandfather settled in Detroit, MIchigan around 1910 or so, and lived \r\nthere the rest of his life.\r\n     \r\nThank you for this opportunity.

She was born in 1870, and \r\napparently came with here husband from Narajow in Galicia. I don't have any hard\r\ninformation on this (the microfilm of the passenger list index is too smudged to\r\nread) but they were buried in the Narajow Bros. plot in Mt. Zion cemetery in \r\nQueens. Apparently Tillie Kandel's parents didn't emigrate to the US, since on \r\nher death certificate their names are given in only Hebrew/Yiddish form, and \r\nhave no English equivalents. The informant for her death certificate is Esther\r\nMiller, who was her daughter and perhaps married a cousin on the Miller side.\r\nNarajow (Narayev) is just a couple towns southeast of Lvov, and you have a \r\ngeneology for a disconnected branch that comes from Lvov (Lemberg) in\r\nGalicia, with a Meshullam as the father and a daughter named Esther. These are \r\nnot the same people of course, but could it be that &quot;Meshel&quot; is short for\r\nMeshullam? Maybe they were in a branch of the family that had the name \r\nMeshullam in it. There seem to be quite a number of descendants of Samuel and \r\nTillie Kandel, since they had seven children.\r\n     \r\nHere are their children:\r\n     \r\nIn the N.Y.

Also, the passenger list \r\nshows that only Tajbe Kandel and her son Jene (Joseph Martin) came together in 1901, \r\nwhich corresponds with the later census data showing that Joseph was the only child \r\nnot born in the U.S. Apparently they lived at the same address until their deaths. \r\nSo it seems likely that Meshel and Chaye Miller didn't immigrate after all.\r\nBeing that the Kandel family should be large (I don't know anything about the \r\nextended family) there might be other people who have some better infomation \r\nthan I.\r\nI believe that three was a Benjamin Kandel living on the same block on E 3rd St \r\nuntil at least the late 1970's. One other avenue I can pursue is to look at the \r\nother names in the Narayev Landmanschaft plot for Millers and see it they are \r\nrelated to Meshel Miller.\r\n     \r\nPlease do include this geneology in your other Miller's list. List Samuel and \r\nTillie Kandel and their children and maybe this will jog someone's memory out there. \r\nI'll try to find out more and keep you posted.\r\n     \r\nI believe that there is a Yizkor book for Narayev-Brezany but I haven't seen it.\r\nMaybe this has some more Miller's in it too.\r\n     \r\nBTW, what Hebrew name do you think Meshel is short for?

I could be that the &quot;Yiddish&quot; double for Mesullam \r\nmight be &quot;Misha&quot; in the same way that all Hebrew names were paired with a &quot;Yiddish&quot; \r\n(German,Polish or Russian) second name, like Dov Ber, Lazer Wolf, or Shraga Feivel, \r\nbecause of the legal prohibition against having an &quot;official&quot; Hebrew name.

I was very impressed \r\nwith your Website!  I'm a relative beginner at genealogy, having only been \r\ndoing this for a year.  What I know is that my great-grandmother's name was \r\nGussie Miller (one of her children's birth certificates indicates it was \r\nactually Chaya Gitel Muller--with an umlat).  She was born circa 1881 in \r\nNemirov, Galicia.  Her parents' names were Pesach and Rifka/Rachel (maiden \r\nname unknown).  Gussie immigrated to NYC in the 1890s; she married Jacob \r\nThaler (previously spelled Tahler) on 5 December 1903 in NYC.  They had 8 \r\nchildren:\r\n    Rachel (Rose) -- my grandmother; born 9 September 1904 in NYC; died 3\r\n                                    November 1989 in the Bronx\r\n    Pesach (Paul) -- born 16 March 1906; died 22 July 1976 \r\n    Anne Ethel -- born circa 1908; died 18 August 1972 \r\n    David -- born 1911; died September 1918\r\n    Bessie (Betty) -- born circa 1912; died 4 July 1988 \r\n    Rebecca (Rhea) -- born 11 March 1913; died 7 January 1994 \r\n    Sarah (Sandy) -- born December 1915; still living\r\n    Edith Yetta -- born 1 June 1920; still living\r\n     \r\nGussie died on 28 June 1966 in NYC and is buried with her husband in the \r\nBrzezaner Young Men's Benevolent Association section in Mt. Zion Cemetery in \r\nMaspeth.\r\n     \r\nI took a cursory look at your Miller information and did not see any \r\nconnection.  If you believe that there may be a link, please let me know. \r\nIf you need additional information about the children, I can provide that. \r\nIncidentally, all of the children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of \r\nGussie and Jacob have formed a &quot;Cousins Club&quot; and try to get together a \r\ncouple times a year in the NYC area.\r\n     \r\nHope this was helpful.\r\n     \r\nDeborah Peskin\r\nLongmeadow, MA\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\r\nAuthor:  &quot;David &amp; Deborah Peskin&quot; &lt;dx2etc@email.msn.com&gt; at INTERNET\r\nDate:    12/04/98  3:58 PM\r\nTo:\tMoishe Miller/PSG/Prudential\r\nSubject:\tRe: Pesach Miller\r\n------------------------------- Message Contents -------------------------------\r\n\r\nMoishe,\r\n\r\nAll I know about my g-g-grandfather Pesach Muller is that he lived in\r\nNemirov, Galicia.  He and his wife had three children:  Sholem, Meyer, and\r\nChaje Gitel (Gussie) who was my great grandmother.  According to Gussie's\r\n1903 NYC marriage certificate, her mother's maiden name was Ruchel Millar\r\n(with an &quot;a&quot;).  I don't know if this was a clerical error--it seems like too\r\nmuch of a coincidence.  The children immigrated to NYC while their parents\r\nremained behind in Europe.  I'm assuming Pesach died by 1906 because Gussie\r\nand her husband had a son born in this year who was named after him.\r\n\r\nDoes any of this sound familiar?

I live in Israel.  My brother, Naftuli Hetzky\r\n(Norman) told me that he met with you and Louis Schonfeld this week -\r\njust the day after I returned to Israel from a visit to the family in\r\nNY.  As my brother suggested, I checked your website and was very\r\nimpressed.  I have been working on ours for quite a while and about 90%\r\nof it is already in the computer at Dorot in the Museum of the Diaspora,\r\nTel-Aviv.\r\n\r\nBecause we have a Miller in the family, the connection to Nyirbator,\r\nHungary jumped out at me.  My father's (Z&quot;L) family -Goldner from his\r\nfather and Rezmuves from his mother - came from Nyirbator where my\r\nfather grew up.  Avraham David (from Nyirbator), my father's maternal\r\ngrandfather, married Lea Bash (possibly of some connection to the writer\r\nof &quot;Megaleh Amukot&quot;).  One of their daughters married Alexander Miller\r\nand went to live in Zsibo.  Of their seven children, two survived -Moshe\r\nand Baruch.  Baruch married Lea, had 9 children and lived in Meah\r\nShearim in Jerusalem till they moved to Brooklyn about 35 years ago.\r\nBoth Moshe and Baruch have since passed away.\r\n\r\nI noticed you were looking for a Bluma Zipkin, so being in Israel, I\r\nchacked the phone book for Tel-Aviv.  There is no Zipkin (or Sipkin)\r\nlisted at all.  I also checked with directory information and was told\r\nthe same.  They did find, however, Allen and Dvora Zipkin in Jerusalem\r\nand a Harry Zipkin in the Smadar Hotel in Cesarea.  What I suggest you\r\ndo about Bluma is contact the &quot;Misrad Hapnim&quot; (Ministry of Interior)\r\nhere with the last known details to see if she had changed her name to\r\nsomething Hebrew as many people do (we were Klein) or changed through\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nMy brother's oldest son is Zvi Elimelech, which you said is popular in\r\nyour tree.

I have a\r\npicture of him at 23 years old in his uniform with a &quot;Star Of David&quot; on his\r\ncollar. Faiga and he were born around 1887. The extended family spoke \r\nYiddish\r\nand Hungarian at home and most were observant Chassidim.\r\nMy father was the youngest of three children to be born in Dibrova \r\n(referred\r\nto  as Dubveh in Letter #27 and Dibeve in Letter #42) but the only child to\r\nsurvive long enough to reach America.  His parents had five more children \r\nin\r\nAmerica, two boys (the older born in 1924, and for the benefit of Eric \r\nMiller\r\nauthor #27 is named Yitzchok Isaac also) and three girls, one who died a\r\nchild.                                      The five surviving adult \r\nchildren\r\nof Mordcha and Shandel (who died and is buried in Queens, NY in 1931 gave\r\nthem 14 grandchildren (of which I am one).  Those 14 produced 25\r\ngreatchildren so far, and those 25 have so far have given life to 6\r\ngreat-great grandchildren.  The youngest born 5 days ago in New Jersey.\r\n            I'm just getting started in my research and will be \r\ninterviewing\r\nmy deceased fathers siblings and cousins for further information.  No doubt\r\ntheir information will be  invaluable.  Until then if you can be of any \r\nhelp\r\nit will certainly be appreciated and treasured.\r\n                                    Thank you for your web page and please\r\npost this letter in your &quot;Other Trees&quot; section.

Most of the relatives are gone and how often I \r\nchide myself for never showing any interest as a young person when \r\nmy father would relate stories which would be invaluable to my \r\ngenealogical endeavers. At any rate this is what I know: My \r\ngrandfather Abraham MILLER emigrated from Russia about 1890 \r\nprobably with his wife, Ida. My father Harry was born in NYC in \r\n1897 and his sister, Rose was born a year later. Abraham died in \r\nPhiladelphia in 1910. My father and his sister moved to and \r\nremained in Philadelphia. My father married Rose LANE and his \r\nsister married Manfred LAPAYOWKER.\r\n \r\nI doubt that I will \"connect\" with anyone but anyway it's worth a \r\ntry.\r\n \r\n    abe miller\r\n    langley, wa\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<HR WIDTH=\"450\" COLOR=\"MAROON\" ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\r\n<LI>\r\n<A NAME=\"Mordecai-2\"></A><br>\r\n<A HREF=\"#top\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0 ALT=\"Top\" ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"></A>\r\n<PRE>Date: Mon, 05 Jun 2000 21:57:41 -0700 \r\nFrom: Brahna Derr <bonnid@usa.net> \r\nSubject: Miller Family \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\nX-Mailer: Mozilla 4.7 [en] (Win98; U) \r\nX-Accept-Language: en \r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nDo you have any information as to the Miller tree that would include\r\nArthur Miller the playright?

Miller and my father was Arthur Clayton Miller \r\nand he claimed roots from Cambria County Pennsylvania. We have not been \r\nable to find any of his relatives. We think he was born sometime between \r\n1865 and 1890. My mother traveled to Johnstown,Pa. in the early 60's and \r\nwe think she found some people that knew him. He was married before and \r\nhis wife and baby were supposed to have died in childbirth. My oldest \r\nbrother was named Earl Franklin Miller, the next son was Arthur Glenn \r\nMiller. We have reason to believe that he was of Jewish descent as the \r\nmilitary placed the star of David on his tombstone, military records are \r\ndestroyed. He spoke French and served in WW I. If you think any of these \r\npieces might fit into your research, I would really like to hear from you. \r\nMy dad passed away in 1956 and we have been trying to fine some link for \r\nmany years. \r\n \r\nThank you,\r\n \r\nMitchell R. Miller\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<HR WIDTH=\"450\" COLOR=\"MAROON\" ALIGN=\"LEFT\">\r\n<LI>\r\n<A NAME=\"Janeva\"></A><br>\r\n<A HREF=\"#top\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" WIDTH=19 HEIGHT=31 BORDER=0

struck me in an instant,for it is the name of my mother's great \r\ngrandfather,so maybe there is a connection. i have not been able to get \r\nthrough to the records of vilkamir in lithuania to find out more of our \r\nroots.\r\n \r\nmy mother was a born miller born in oudtshoorn south africa in l9l0.her \r\nfather came out to cape town alone and left his wife CHANA born sheigam \r\nfrom janeva lithuania and  four sons sons ,.it took him five years to save \r\nenough money to send for them to join him in cape town.after a few years \r\ntwo more sons were born to them twins this time alex and jos.\r\n \r\nthen in quick succession three daughters were born after the family had \r\nmoved to oudtshoorn becky,rachel(my mother) and sarah the only surviving \r\nsibling stil living in johannesburg 89 years old now.\r\n \r\nthe oldest son simon had a departmental store in the town for many years \r\nhe had five children louis,harold,the only daughter) reggie,meyer and natie,\r\nharold still living in cape town and the youngest son natie living in england.\r\n \r\nthe second son cecil had four sons sam,harry,arthur and bokkie,bokkie is the \r\nonly survivung one and living in johannesburg\r\n \r\nthe third son morris had three sons hymie who came to israel in l948 and has \r\nremained here ever since,davy who lived in bloemfontein who passed away recently \r\nand bennie who still lives in cape town.\r\n \r\nthe fourth son raphael had three sons and a daughter, jack who lives in port \r\nelizabeth s.a. abe who lived in toronto canada, deceased,aarie who lives in \r\njerusalem and haddassah also of jerusalem,\r\n \r\nalex had two children one still in cape town and a son now of haifa israe l .mary \r\nand sydney.\r\n \r\njos who came on aliyah with his

len\r\nsarah who son lives in london and daughter living in bloemfontein.goldie and mannie.\r\n \r\nthere  were 28 grandchildren born to chana and mordechai peretz miller and i do not know \r\nhow many great grandchildren.\r\n \r\nwhile mordechai peretz came to s.a. to make his fortune,his father benjamin and his two \r\nbrothers simon and tuvia came to palestine,they owned a pardessand part of it was donated \r\nto the state and became the campus of the weitzman institute for this effort the eldest \r\nson was invited to be the first president of the new little state and being a very modest \r\nman and not wishing to be in the limelight he refused this honour.\r\n \r\nmany years a go a cousin came to israel on a visit and as all the offspring do,went to the \r\ncemetary at rehovot israel to visit the graves of our grandoparents. she also saw the graves \r\nof the three brothers,simon,tuvia and mordechai perez and their father,benjamin and of course \r\non HIS tombstone was the name of his father,MOISHE MILLER. they all came from lithuania from \r\na little town called then vilkamir near vilnius the capital,\r\n \r\ni don't know if we are connected to you but the name was the same and it took my fancy,maybe \r\nthere are other Millers floating around who may be interested and have other stories to tell,\r\ni really wanted to go back a few more generations if anyone had information more than is at \r\npresent in my  possession.\r\n \r\nhope to hear from you or read more about ourselves in your website.lehitraot \r\n \r\nminnie blume
