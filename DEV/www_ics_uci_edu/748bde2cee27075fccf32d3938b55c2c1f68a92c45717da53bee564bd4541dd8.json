Perhaps more than any other writing,\npersuasive writing requires appreciation of the reader&#39;s interests and\ngoals.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>This assignment:</B>  For this assignment,\nyou will write a letter to one of the policy makers listed below.  In approximately\nthree pages, you should take a position, recommend some action, and back\nit up with the best reasoning you can; don&#39;t just raise the issue or\nstate a concern.  Plan actually to <I>send</I> this letter; don&#39;t treat\nit as simply a classroom exercise.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Choose a public policy issue involving technology,\nan issue you care about strongly, and one about which you have some information\nor knowledge.  It&#39;s much easier to write with conviction if you really\nhave that conviction; it requires real talent to fake it. On the other hand,\nyou must approach your topic with enough objectivity to understand the opposing\npoint of view and deal with those arguments in a reasoned way.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Your topic should be one that you as a computer\nscientist have some particular reason to address.  Some current policy issues\nthat relate to computing are objectionable material on the Web, Email &quot;spam,&quot;\nand various privacy issues.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>You should choose a specific recipient, a\npolicy maker who is an appropriate audience for your opinion, such as President\nObama, Senator Boxer or Feinstein, or the editors of the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>\nor the <I>New York Times</I>.  If you have a specialized issue, we can suggest\nother appropriate policy makers. </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>As a first step, write a five- to ten-line\noutline of your argument, listing the supporting points and the conclusion\nlike a syllogism; turn this in with each revision of your letter. You may\nfind useful the entries in one of the writing guides on argument, logic,\nand thesis; you might also think back on what you know about symbolic logic.\n </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Your conclusion should recommend some action\non someone&#39;s part; don&#39;t simply raise the issue and complain about\nthe status quo.  Moreover, be sure that the recipient of your letter is\nsomeone who has the power to take the action you recommend. Broadly, here\nare some guidelines: If you want a new law introduced (or if you want to\nsupport or oppose currently proposed legislation), write a legislator (Senators\nFeinstein or Boxer, your local member of Congress, or the chair of the relevant\nHouse or Senate committee).  If you want some action by the Executive Branch\n(e.g., for the Justice Department to renew an antitrust case against Microsoft),\nwrite to the person in charge of that branch (the Attorney General in the\ncase of the Justice Department).  The most effective thing the President\ncan do is move public opinion; you should write to the President if you\nwant him to take a public stand on some issue (or if you want him to sign\nor veto a particular piece of legislation that has passed out of Congress);\nthe President doesn't officially originate or introduce legislation, and\nhe won&#39;t even have his staff propose legislation for a legislator to\nintroduce except on the biggest public policy issues (like health care or\ntax reform).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>If you took Writing 39C at UCI and wrote a\nresearch paper on a technical policy issue, you may write about the same\nissue here.  Note, however, that a letter to a policy maker is different\nfrom a research paper:  This letter is shorter, it won&#39;t cite research\nsources as completely and meticulously, and it will recommend to the recipient\na particular course of action and address explicitly the reasons why the\nrecipient should take that action.  In particular, you need to say what\nyou want, right up front, and then give the reasons.  It&#39;s an unfortunate\nand brutal fact that high-profile officials receive hundreds or thousands\nof letters a day; they have staff who screen them, perhaps just reading\nthe first paragraph and tallying the letter as &quot;pro&quot; or &quot;con&quot;\non an particular issue.  It&#39;s the rare letter that&#39;s so well written\nthat the staff person will read the whole thing, and even rarer still that\nthey&#39;ll pass it along to the official him- or herself.  Of course it&#39;s\nthat kind of gemlike letter that we&#39;re aiming for, but for it to pass\nthe first threshold, it has to state up front what it wants the official\nto do.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Finally, make sure you address your letter\nproperly; you don&#39;t say &quot;Dear Mr. Obama&quot; when addressing the\nPresident.  (Search for &quot;forms of address&quot; in Google if you need\nto.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4><B>Due dates:</B>  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>&bull; April 16&mdash;Your outline, together with a good\ndraft of your letter.
