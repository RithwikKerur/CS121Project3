Demaine, John Iacono, and Stefan Langerman, SODA 2004.   \n<p>\n\nThe authors introduce a new data structuring paradigm called\n<i>retroactive data structures</i>.&nbsp; In these data structures,\nthe historical sequence of operations performed on the data structure\nis not fixed.&nbsp; They allow the insertion and deletion of\n<i>operations</i> at arbitrary past times, subject only to\nconsistency.&nbsp; The authors initiate the study of retroactive data\nstructures by formally defining the model and its variants.&nbsp; They\nshow that retroactivity differs from persistence in that efficient\nretroactivity is not always achievable, and therefore go on to present\nseveral specific retroactive data structures as well as techniques for\ntransforming certain classes of data structures into their retroactive\nequivalents.&nbsp; I will present the retroactive model and touch on a\nselection of their results.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
