A Stropkov contact claiming descent \r\nfrom R' Ezriel Green and the Bnei Yissochur. His name is Hersh Klar and I met \r\nwith him this afternoon. He gave permission to give out his phone number. He \r\nlives in Williamsburg at 718 384 5038. His cell is 646 739 4255. He said \r\nMordche Friedman, his maternal grandfather, was born in around 1890's, lived \r\nin Stropkov and perished in the Holocaust. I do not see the family on the The \r\nJews of Stropkov, 1942-1945: Their Names, Their Fate webpage at\r\nhttp://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/stropkov1/str001.html\r\nHis grandfather:Ezriel Friedman, son of Mordche and Shaindel. Mordche's mother \r\nwas Hinde Golda. \r\n\r\nI do know that R' Pesach Avrohm Schonfeld, son-in-law of R' Ezriel Green, was ABD \r\nKurima. He had a son-in-law named Moshe Baum from Stropkov. Perhaps that is his \r\nconnection. Any ideas or thoughts?\r\n\r\nBy the way, let me introduce you to each other. Ezra Holczer is researching R' \r\nEzriel Green. Melody Amsel is researching Stropkov. Hersh Klar is my cousin through \r\nPesach Langsam. He is even more closely related through my maternal (Yurowitz) line.\r\n\r\nAny ideas as to his ancestry to R' Hersh Mylech Spira, the Bnei Yissochur?\r\n\r\nL'shana Tova!\r\nMoishe Miller\r\nBrooklyn NY\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\n\r\nPS: Hersh, can you tell us the family name of R' Mordche's wife, Shaindel?\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 5/7/02</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
