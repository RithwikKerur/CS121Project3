I have two\npapers on this subject: \"<a href=\n\"/~eppstein/pubs/p-parammst.html\">Using Sparsification for\nParametric Minimum Spanning Tree Problems</a>\" (with D.\nFern&aacute;ndez-Baca and G. Slutzki) shows how to compute this\nsequence in time O(<i>mn</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>), and \"<a href= \n\"/~eppstein/pubs/p-geomlb.html\">Geometric Lower Bounds for\nParametric Matroid Optimization</a>\" derives a lower bound of\nOmega(<i>m</i>&nbsp;alpha(<i>n</i>)) on the number of trees in this\nsequence. However this lower bound is still quite far from the\nknown upper bound of O(<i>m</i>&nbsp;sqrt&nbsp;<i>n</i>). \n\n<p>In this talk I describe ongoing work on my attempts to improve\nthis lower bound. Instead of considering the minimum spanning tree\nitself, I consider the quantity</p>\n\n<center><i>q</i>(<i>x</i>) = min<sub>path <i>p</i></sub>\nmax<sub>edge <i>e</i> of <i>p</i></sub> <i>\nf</i><sub><i>e</i></sub>(<i>x</i>)</center>\n\nwhere the minimum is over all paths in the graph that connect two\nspecified terminals <i>s</i> and <i>t</i>. Equivalently, this\nquantity is the weight of the heaviest edge of the path from <i>\ns</i> to <i>t</i> in the MST. \n\n<p>Geometrically, the shape formed by plotting <i>q</i>(<i>x</i>)\nagainst <i>x</i> is a lower envelope (min) of an upper envelope\n(max) of certain sets of lines (plots of each individual edge\nweight). The upper envelope of lines is a concave chain, so <i>\nq</i>(<i>x</i>) is the lower envelope of certain concave chains. It\nforms a monotone path in the line arrangement (monotone simply\nmeans that it is the plot of a function, having only one\nintersection with any vertical line). The convex vertices in this\npath correspond to minimum spanning tree changes, although the\nconcave vertices may not.</p>\n\n<p>My first attempt to prove a better lower bound on the number of\nminimum spanning trees starts from a construction of Matousek, who\nshowed that monotone paths in arrangements may have complexity\nOmega(<i>m</i><sup>5/3</sup>) (no nontrivial upper bound is known).\nSince Matousek's lower bound on monotone paths is larger than our\nknown upper bound on minimum spanning trees, there are some\nmonotone paths that do not correspond to minimum spanning tree\nsequences. I tried a simplified example in which <i>m</i> lines are\npartitioned into sqrt&nbsp;<i>m</i> \"cables\" of sqrt&nbsp;<i>m</i>\nlines each, with an additional <i>m</i> lines connecting up the\nintersections of pairs of cables in such a way that each\nintersection contributes sqrt&nbsp;<i>m</i> vertices (both convex\nand concave) to the monotone path. It is possible to represent this\nmonotone path as a lower envelope of a simple family of concave\nchains, however when I tried to translate this family back into\ngraph-theoretic terms I ended up with \"coat-hangers\" (triangles\nwith a dangling edge) instead of paths.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, I tried restricting the problem further, to paths in\nseries-parallel graphs. Series composition corresponds to forming\n<i>q</i>(<i>x</i>) as the upper envelope of two paths coming from\nthe two subgraphs being composed, and parallel composition\ncorresponds to a lower envelope. Therefore, one can re-interpret\nthe problem as a form of \"constructive solid geometry\" for monotone\npaths: one is given a set of monotone paths, initially just <i>\nm</i> lines, and can repeatedly perform operations that combine two\npaths, replacing the two by a single upper or lower envelope. How\ncomplex a path can result from this process? The bounds I currently\nknow are exactly those for the original parametric MST problem,\nOmega(<i>m</i>&nbsp;alpha(<i>n</i>)) and\nO(<i>m</i>&nbsp;sqrt&nbsp;<i>n</i>).</p>\n\n<p>In summary, I still haven't made progress in narrowing the gap\nbetween lower and upper bounds for parametric MSTs, but at least\nI've found some interesting ways of translating the problem into\nsome geometric formulations that don't look like they should have\nanything to do with MSTs.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
