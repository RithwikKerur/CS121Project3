The main objective of this meeting was to provide\na forum where people interested in fostering interoperability\nbetween distributed web authoring applications could meet, exchange\ninformation about the current state of the art and practice, identify\nkey interoperability issues, and formulate an agenda for achieving\ninteroperability.\n</P>\n\n<P>\nWhile there are many tools on the market (e.g., SoftQuad HotMetal\nPro 2.0, Quarterdeck WebAuthor 2.0, Adobe PageMill 1.0, InContext\nSpider 1.1) which provide a graphical user interface for the authoring\nof HyperText Markup Language (HTML) format files and layout of\nassociated graphic content, these tools require the user to have\ndirect access to the physical storage of the name space served\nby a HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server.  This effectively\nlimits the use of these tools to computers connected to a local\narea network (LAN) containing the physical storage.  In contrast,\nan emerging class of tools (e.g., Microsoft FrontPage 1.1, AOLpress/AOLserver\n1.1) allow users to save their work directly to an HTTP server,\naffording a style of work where authors are located remotely to\nthe HTTP server hosting their content.  This second class of tools,\nknown as distributed web content authoring applications, were\nthe focus of this working group.\n</P>\n\n<P>\nMeeting participants included members from the IETF HTTP Working\nGroup, the World Wide Web Consortium, the document management\ncommunity, software configuration management companies, distributed\nweb authoring tool vendors and researchers, and the academic hypertext\nversioning community.  This wide range of expertise resulted in\nvery detailed and considered discussion of issues concerning distributed\nweb content authoring.\n</P>\n\n<P>\nThis web site &lt;<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/sanmateo/\" ><B>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/sanmateo/</B></A>&gt;\ncontains:\n</P>\n\n<UL>\n<LI>A list of participants at the meeting\n\n<LI>Final agenda for the meeting\n\n<LI>Minutes of the meeting\n\n<LI>Transparencies shown at the meeting\n</UL>\n\n<P>\nI (the organizer) would like to thank Dave Long of America Online\nfor arranging the conference room at AOL Productions, and for\nhis in-meeting support.
