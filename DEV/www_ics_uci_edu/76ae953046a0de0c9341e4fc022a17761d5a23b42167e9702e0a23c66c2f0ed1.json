Over the last two decades, event\nnotification services have evolved within hosts (as kernel, graphical\nuser interface, operating system, and object-oriented runtime events),\nwithin local area networks (as tool integration, remote procedure call,\nnetworked windowing system, and distributed file system lease events),\nand within wide area networks (as telepresence, interactive simulation,\nnetwork management, and workflow events).  Emerging generations of these\ncollaborative applications now need to span organizational boundaries -\nand require event notification mechanisms that scale to the Internet.\nThis implies more than adapting to wide area networks' space and time\nscales: successful Internet-scale services will have to be evolvable,\ndecentralized, secure, and reliable within an imperfect network.\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
