Given an\nundirected graph embedded on an orientable surface of genus g, with\ntwo specified vertices s and t, our algorithm computes a minimum\n(s,t)-cut in g^{O(g)} n log n time; if there is time, we will also\ndescribe a different algorithm which computes a maximum $(s,t)$-flow\nin in $O(g7 n \\log^2n \\log^2C)$ time for integer capacities that sum\nto $C$, or in $(g \\log n)^O(g) n$ time for real capacities. Except\nfor\nthe special case of planar graphs, the best previous time bounds for\nfinding min cuts or max flows in embedded graphs follow from\nalgorithms for general sparse graphs.\n\n<p>\nThis is joint work with Jeff Erickson and Amir Nayyeri, which\nappeared\nin SOCG and STOC last year.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
