\r\nvariables.\r\nA graphical model contains many functions over these variables which have an \r\nunderlying graph structure and represents an overall joint function composed \r\nof these functions.\r\nExamples include Bayesian networks, Markov networks, and weighted constraint \r\nsatisfaction problems.\r\nIn these, a common query is the optimization query, which is to find a joint \r\nconfiguration of variables that optimizes the objective function defined by \r\nthe joint function.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the best frameworks for these queries is the AND/OR search framework, \r\nwhich casts this optimization problem as a heuristic search problem.\r\nAND/OR Branch-and-Bound (AOBB) and AND/OR Best-First (AOBF) search are both \r\nalgorithms that search the AND/OR search space, which exploits conditional \r\nindependencies in a problem.\r\nThe performance of these algorithms are highly dependent on the strength of \r\nits heuristics, which is the main focus of this thesis.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe first investigate the well-known technique of look-ahead, commonly used in \r\nsearch applications such as games, adapting it to the optimization task in \r\ngraphical models.\r\nIn particular, we analyze the typically used MBE heuristic within the AND/OR \r\nsearch framework, establishing a connection between the ``bucket error'' of \r\nMBE \r\nand the residual.\r\nThis connection enables a cost-effective scheme that allows look-ahead to be \r\nselectively performed only where it is likely to have a positive impact on \r\nthe heuristic.\r\nAn extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that we are able to improve \r\nthe power of AND/OR Branch-and-Bound.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSecond, in seeking an anytime scheme for providing lower bounds on the \r\noptimal solution, we explore the impact of subproblem ordering on AOBF.\r\nOur analysis demonstrates that this can significantly impact the performance \r\nof AOBF for both exact and anytime solutions.\r\nWe propose heuristics based on the bucket error of MBE and demonstrate their \r\npotential.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThird, to tackle problems where MBE is known to perform poorly on, we explore \r\ndynamic heuristics that are computed during search rather than static \r\nheuristics which are pre-computed such as with MBE.\r\nWe adapt the FGLP algorithm, a coordinate-descent method for a linear \r\nprogramming relaxation-based bound on the objective, for use a a heuristic \r\ngenerator for AOBB.\r\nThrough a re-derived update method and a defined update schedule, we \r\ndemonstrate the advantage of FGLP heuristics on problems known to be \r\ndifficult when using MBE.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAdditionally, we extend AND/OR Multi-valued Decision Diagrams, a framework \r\nfor the compact representation of functions in graphical models.\r\nWe provide a previously missing empirical evaluation of previously introduced \r\nmethods.\r\nWe also extend the framework to allow for exact bucket elimination to be \r\nimplemented using AOMDDs, thus pushing the feasibility of bucket elimination \r\non problems that normally require an infeasible amount of memory.\r\n</div>\r\n      <br>\r\n
