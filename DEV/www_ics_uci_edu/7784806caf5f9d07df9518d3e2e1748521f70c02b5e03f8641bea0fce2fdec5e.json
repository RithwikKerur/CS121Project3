We consider algorithms\nfor integrated prefetching and caching in a model with a fixed-size\ncache and any number of backing storage devices(which we will call\ndisks). The integration of caching and prefetching with a single\ndisk was previously considered by Cao et al. We show that the\nnatural extension of their aggressive algorithm to the parallel\ndisk case is suboptimal by a factor of (nearly) the number of disks\nin the worst case. Our main result is a new algorithm, reverse\nagressive, with near optimal performance for integrated prefetching\nand caching in the presence of multiple disks.</p>\n\n<p>(From a <a href=\"http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/events/FOCS96/\">FOCS\n'96</a> paper by Tracy Kimbrel and Anna R.
