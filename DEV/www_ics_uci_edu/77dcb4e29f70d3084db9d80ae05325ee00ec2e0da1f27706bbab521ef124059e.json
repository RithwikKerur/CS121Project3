EXACTLY one literal in each clause is true. The\nExact 3-Satisfiability problem (X3SAT) is the restriction of XSAT to\nformulas with at most three literals per clause.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe are interested in algorithms for these two problems with good\nworst-case complexity, i.e. better than the trivial O(2^n) which comes\nfrom trying all possible truth assignments. For XSAT we improve the\nrunning time from O(2^(0.2441*n)) to O(2^(0.2325*n)) and for X3SAT we\nimprove the running time from O(2^(0.1626*n)) to O(2^(1379*n)).\n</p>\n<p>\nOur algorithms work by analysing the formula and branching depending\non a number of different cases. As the number of cases is rather\nlarge, I will give an overview of the ideas and only cover some of the\ncases in detail.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is joint work with Bolette Ammitzb\u00f8ll Madsen and Bjarke\nSkjernaa. It has not been published yet, but if you are interested,\nlease send me an email at jespermn@ics.uci.edu.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ISO-8859-1"}
