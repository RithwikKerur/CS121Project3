If you have to miss lecture for any\r\nreason, please ask one of your classmates to fill you\r\nin on what you missed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are four lab sections for this class. Each section meets one hour per\r\nweek on Friday. This is an important time to get questions answered about homework\r\nproblems and labs.\r\nSome lab time will be spent walking you through features\r\nof Matlab that you will need for your lab assignments.Lab time is the best time\r\nfor troubleshooting\r\nissues that come up with Matlab or lab assignments.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Obtaining Assistance</h3>\r\nThe best way to get your questions answered is by coming\r\nto lecture, office hours or lab and asking them there.\r\nIn general,\r\nif I'm not busy with something else, I am happy to answer\r\nshort questions while I am in my office, so feel free to\r\nstop by during other times in the week.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nAll email with questions about course material should be sent to the\r\nfollowing email address:\r\n<A href=\"mailto:ics6n-questions@ics.uci.edu\">ics6n-questions@ics.uci.edu</A>.\r\nThis is an alias for the instructor and the TAs.  It ensures\r\nthat we both see your message and the response.  It also gives you better\r\nturnaround time.\r\n<LI>Please also include the following information:\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> The string \"ICS 6N:\" at the beginning of the subject line\r\n<LI> Your name\r\n<LI> Your student number\r\n</UL>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor questions about grading, please email the person who graded the assignment.\r\nBetter yet, attend that person's office hours.\r\nAll homework will be graded by Yen. All quizes will be graded by me.\r\nLabs will be graded by one of the two TAs.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<H3>Course Announcements</H3>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>Course announcements will be sent via email to all students enrolled\r\nin the class, at their official UCI email address.\r\n<LI>\r\n<A  href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/f13/36530/\">Click here</A> for the\r\narchive of these messages.\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Assignments</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThere are weekly written homework questions every week from the text.\r\nThese are due the Wednesday after they are covered in lecture.\r\nSee the assigned problems and due dates in the course schedule.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are four lab assignments due over the course of the quarter.\r\nThese are also due on Wednesdays.\r\nAll of the labs will require some programming in Matlab.\r\nThe lab assignments and material presented in lab section should\r\nprovide all the information you need to know in order to complete\r\nthe lab assignments. In addition, there are many online tutorials\r\navailable to you if you decide you need some additional help.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nLab assignements will consist of performing some Matlab instructions\r\nas well as written work. The results of all the questions should be\r\ncopied into a Word file. You will hand in a written copy of the word file.\r\nYou can use a different editor than Word if you prefer, but it will need\r\nto enable copying pictures and graphs.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou do not have to purchase a copy of Matlab for your own machine.\r\nIf  you attend lab regularly, you will likely be able to complete\r\nmuch of your lab work in class.\r\nIn addition to scheduled lab time for this class, you can drop in on\r\nany of the following labs to have access to a computer with Matlab.\r\nIf the room is being used by an instructor as part of their schedule\r\nlab time, you can ask them if you can use one of the computers during\r\ntheir class.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>ICS 365.</b> Lab hours are posted\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/lab_schedule/index.php\">\r\nhere.</a>\r\nMatlab is installed on only some of the machines. Ask the\r\nlab attendant if you need help finding one.\r\nThis lab only has courses scheduled MTF 8-10, so there is plently\r\nof opportunity to use these machines.</li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/roomfinder/room.php?building_abbr=MSTB\">MSTB 210</a>\r\nLab hourse are posted <a href=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/computing/labs/instructional.html\">here.</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/roomfinder/room.php?building_abbr=MSTB\">SBSG 240</a>\r\nLab hourse are posted <a href=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/computing/labs/instructional.html\">here.</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<b> Weekly quizes: </b>\r\nI will give a very short weekly quiz at the beginning of class every\r\nFriday, starting in week 3. Since Nov 29 is a holiday, we will have a quiz the following\r\nMonday, Dec 2, instead. There will be a total of 8 quizes.\r\nThe quizes will last approximately 10 minutes and will be given out\r\nat the beginning of lecture. They will cover material from two weeks prior.\r\nThat way you have a chance to practice topics in homework exercises and get\r\nfeedback before the quiz.\r\nIn determining your course score, I will drop the lowest two quiz scores.\r\nHowever, these dropped scores are intended to cover any missed quizes\r\nfor whatever reason you need to miss a quiz. This includes any medical\r\nproblems, personal issues or school-related events.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrades for the assignements will be posted through EEE.\r\nI will grade the quizes, Yen will grade homework and the TAs will grade the lab assignments.\r\nIf you have questions regarding grading, please see the person who\r\ngraded that particular item.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Text</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe have one required text for this course.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<em> Linear Algebra and its Applications, 4th. edition.</em>, by\r\nDavid Lay.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Course Structure</h3>\r\n\r\nThe grading criteria for the course is:\r\n<ul>\r\nHomework 9%<br/>\r\nLab assignments 20%<br>\r\nQuizes 35%<br>\r\nFinal 35%<br>\r\nCompleting the Course Evaluation 1%<br>\r\n</ul>\r\nNote that there is a tiny bit of credit given for completing the course evaluation towards the\r\nend of the quarter. It is\r\navailable through <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/\"> EEE </a> and is\r\nusually released a couple  weeks from the end of the quarter.\r\nIf enough students complete the evaluation then I have access to the list of students\r\nwho completed the evaluation. However, I do not see any evaluation results until the\r\nquarter is over and grades have been turned in. Even after the quarter when I do\r\nsee the evaluation results, they are completely anonymous. Thus, there is no risk\r\nto you in being completely honest in your evaluation. I take these evaluations very\r\nseriously and use them to improve my teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n<H3>Missed Final Exam Policy</H3>\r\nThe final exam will be on Friday, December 13, 8:00AM-10:00AM. (Friday the 13th!)\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> If you miss the final exam and do not have a valid reason, you will receive\r\na score of 0 on the exam.\r\n<LI> The following policy applies if you miss the final exam for a valid reason.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>\r\nThere are only two classes of valid reasons for missing the final exam:\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>  An unforeseeable emergency, such as a medical emergency.\r\nIn such cases I will ask for documentation.\r\n<LI> An absence from an exam due to a foreseeable circumstance\r\nthat I have approved in advance.\r\n</OL>\r\n<LI>\r\nA work conflict is NOT a valid reason for missing the final exam.\r\nThe examination times\r\nare announced at the beginning of the quarter, so there is plenty of\r\ntime to plan your work schedule.\r\n<LI> If you wait until after the exam to get a foreseeable excuse approved,\r\nand it is not approved,\r\nyou will receive a grade of zero (0) on the exam.\r\n<LI> If I accept your reason for missing the final exam, at my option I may\r\neither (1) give you a makeup exam or (2) assign your grade on the basis\r\nof the remaining course work that you did not miss.\r\n<LI> If I give a makeup exam, I may give it less weight\r\nthan announced on the course web page.\r\n</UL>\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>\r\n    <p>The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established an academic honesty policy. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">Read it.</a></p>\r\n    <p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n    <h4>Guidelines to avoid plagarism:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>Do not look at another person's homework.</b>\r\n      Instead you should prefer to discuss the problem in plain English.\r\n      This helps you to communicate clearly, practice technical jargon as it applies to your problem, and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior different from what you expect.\r\n      <li><b>Do not write down the solution in your notes.</b>\r\n      It is perfectly fine (and encouraged) to collborate on work.\r\n      Working in a group is a rewarding experience, and definitely a necessary skill in any professional career.\r\n      The collaboration can include drawing diagrams and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard.\r\n      However, you should avoid writing the solution in your notes.\r\n      It is very useful to rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you solve it again on your own.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>We expect that:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among yourselves.</b> Making sure that others follow these guidelines will help to ensure that they don't pass off your work as their own.</p>\r\n      <li><b>Your work honestly represents your efforts.</b> The entire purpose of obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of skills and experience that will help you later on. If you do not perform the work yourself, then you have cheated yourself out of the education. Employers in our field can (and do) screen applicants for skills and knowledge. You will perform poorly (and discredit UCI) if you do not practice now by doing your own work.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\u0000", "encoding": "ascii"}
