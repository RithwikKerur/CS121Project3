What you may not know is\r\nthat Chava Rosner was Yosef Shlomo's 2nd wife.  He was briefly married to\r\nanother woman, possibly by the name of Lya? and they were divorced.  They\r\ndid have a son, my grandfather, (Zvi Aliemelech ben Josef Shlomo known as\r\nHerman) who lived in Cluj Romania (was Hungary before WWI and called\r\nKolozsvar or Klausenberg.)  Herman married Emma Levy, came to the U.S. and\r\nsettled in Pittsburgh.  Emma came with their 7 children in 1926 and followed\r\nhim to Pgh.  My father, Alex Eckstein is one of those children.\r\n\r\nI can provide you with alot of information about this part of the family and\r\nquite a bit about the Rosner side as well.  I also have a second cousin in\r\nthe NYC area (Brooklyn, I believe) who has been working extensively on the\r\nEckstein/Rosner genealogy.  I just heard from him recently, which sparked my\r\ninterest in doing some research on the internet, which wasn't a factor when\r\nwe last corresponded in the 1980's!  With his permission, I will put you in\r\ntouch with him.\r\n\r\nI am really impressed by your work! I have found alot of Eckstein\r\ngenealogies on the Internet, but none of them are Jewish.  Of course I am\r\njust a \"newbie\" in all this.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you would like me to give you more information.  I live in\r\nupstate NY in the Village of Alfred.  My husband is a sociology professor at\r\nAlfred University, and I am a librarian at the SUNY College of Technology at\r\nAlfred.  My brother lives in New City, and my Aunt Irene (Eckstein) Kohn\r\nlives on the Lower East Side, so I do get down to the city fairly often.\r\nMaybe we can all get together sometime?\r\n\r\nRegards, and hope to hear from you soon.\r\n\r\nBarbara Jean Eckstein Greil\r\ngreilbj@alfredstate.edu\r\n\r\n61 Pine Hill Drive\r\nAlfred, New York 14802 \r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Mon, 20 Aug 2001 23:28:06 -0400\r\nTo: \"Greil, Barbara\" &lt;GreilBJ@alfredstate.edu>\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Eckstein family\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your inquiry.

I do have some questions, though:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Re Moishe's question: Do you have any of your family in GEDCOM (or Family\r\nTree Maker) format?\r\n\r\n\r\nNo--I don't know what this is since I am a relative \"newbie\" at this.  I\r\nthink I have seen Family Tree Maker at Walmart.  Which product is better in\r\nyour view?\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  I talked to my Dad about this recently, and he thinks there might be a\r\nmistake with respect to Yosef Shlomo's wive(s).  You both have his wife\r\nas\"Chava Rosner.\"  According to my Dad, his grandfather's first wife was Lya\r\n(sp??) Sternberger and they had one child, who was my grandfather Herman\r\nEckstein.  His hebrew name was not Hersh Melech, but Zvi Alemelech ben Yosef\r\nShlomo.  After Lya and Josef Sholomo were divorced, he married Harriet\r\nFreidman and they had nine children.  The Rosner name comes into play\r\nbecause Lya married a man named Morton Rosner and had 4 or 5 children whose\r\nnames I have and also those of their children, but not right in front of me\r\nnow.  I will get this info to you.  Now this is according to my father, who\r\nsaid he got the information from my Uncle Albert, who was the keeper of the\r\nfamily genealogy and was the oldest.  Of course he might just be confused\r\nabout all of this.  I will try to verify this with my cousins in Phoenix\r\n(John and Paul Eckstein).  \r\n\r\n\r\nAvery-  I saw Maurice Rucker and he said \"Hi\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThat's all for now.  Will be in touch soon.

Over the years\r\nhe has been compiling an Eckstein genealogy and he recently got in touch\r\nwith me.  He would like to update his records about our part of the\r\nfamily--births, marriages, deaths etc.  Any information you could provide\r\nor corroborate would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nHe would like the Hebrew and English names of your parents, of you and\r\nyour siblings, of your children, and their children if there are any.\r\nYour birthplace and that of your parents and children, grandchildren,\r\nwould also be great.  Marriage and death dates are also important.\r\nAnything you can provide would be terrific.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing from Avery, I decided to look on the internet to see what\r\nelse I could find out about Ecksteins.  Lots of non-Jewish Ecksteins, but\r\nI &lt;did> find an extensive genealogy to the Langsam, Miller, Spria,\r\nEckstein genealogy.  It seems as though we are related to these families.\r\nI have been in touch with Moishe Miller, who is compiling this genealogy.\r\nHe has done a wonderful job, as has Avery.  Here is a link to Moishe's\r\nwork:  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam.htm\r\n \r\nYou may be wondering how we are related to Avery Horowitz.  I hope I get\r\nthis right!  His mother is Helen Applebaum Horowitz, and she is the\r\ndaughter of Goldie Eckstein Applebaum.  Goldie was one of the nine\r\nchildren of our great-grandfather Yosef Shlomo Eckstein and Chava Rosner\r\n(his second wife, according to Avery). Remember that Yosef Shlomo and our\r\ngreat-grandmother Lya or Lia Sternberger or Steinberger had one child,\r\nHerman, our grandfather, and then they divorced.  Therefore Avery and all\r\nof us share the same great-great grandfather.  (A side note:  my Dad\r\nbelieves that his grandfather's second wife was someone named Friedman,\r\nbecause he remembers having cousins with the last name of Rosner.\r\nAccording to Avery, this is because Lya, the first wife, married a cousin\r\nof Chava's named Morton Rosner.  Just to make it  &lt;really> interesting,\r\ntwo of Lya and Morton Rosner's daughters married two Applebaum brothers;\r\nthis is in addition to the fact that Avery's grandmother Goldie also\r\nmarried a man named Applebaum.  I am not sure if &lt;these> Applebaums are\r\nrelated)  If this seems confusing, believe me, it is!\r\n\r\nI understand that Uncle Albert was also compiling information.  I am\r\nhoping that we can all share this information.  Additional information\r\nabout grandfather Herman (his birthplace, date, marriage date(s), etc)\r\nwould be great.  Also, any information that anyone has on our great-great\r\ngrandfather Yosef Shlomo would be very important including birth/death\r\ndates and places, his occupation.\r\n \r\nIf any of you have pictures of any of our ancestors it would be great to\r\ncreate a digital archive.  I would be happy to scan any photographs and\r\npost them to everyone.\r\n \r\nNote:  I have a copy of the passenger manifest sheet from our parents voyage\r\non the SSRoosevelt in 1926.  If anyone wants a copy of this, I would be\r\nhappy to duplicate it and send it on.  (Carol, your copy will be in the mail\r\nshortly.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHope you don't mind that I have contacted you this way, and I know this is\r\nalot of work on your part.  Love and best wishes to all of you.\r\n \r\nLove-\r\n\r\nCousin Barbara \r\n \r\n61 Pine Hill Drive\r\nAlfred, NY 14802\r\n \r\ngreilbj@alfredstate.edu\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Tue, 4 Sep 2001 12:00:10 -0400 (EDT) \r\nFrom: Avery M Horowitz &lt;averymh@touro.edu> \r\nTo: \"Greil, Barbara\" &lt;GreilBJ@alfredstate.edu> \r\ncc: \"'moishe'\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: Re: FW: Please add us to Your family geneaology mailing list \r\n\r\n\r\nOn Mon, 3 Sep 2001, Greil, Barbara wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n> What do you folks make of this??\r\n>  \r\n> B\r\n> -----Original Message-----\r\n> From: Applbaum [mailto:apples@barak-online.net]\r\n> Sent: Sunday, September 02, 2001 12:19 PM\r\n> To: GreilBJ@alfredstate.edu\r\n> Subject: Please add us to Your family geneaology mailing list\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> I am Yosef Shlomo Applbaum...\r\n>    :-)\r\n>     Joseph S.
