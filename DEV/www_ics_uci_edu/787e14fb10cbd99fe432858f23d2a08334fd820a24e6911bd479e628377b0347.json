The game of Pente (TM) is the commercial version.\n\nThe first player has a large advantage, and the game has long been\nconsidered by professionals to be a win for Black.  But until now, there\nhas not been a proof of this claim.\n\nThere are several variations, designed to reduce the advantage for Black:\n\n(1) Playing on a full 19x19 Go board (but this actually *increases*\n    Black's advantage [Sak81]). \n\n(2) A line of six connected stones does not win (for either player) --\n    it must be exactly five stones in a row.\n\n(3) Black must play the first stone on the center point and\n    the second stone must be diagonally connected to this stone.\n\n(4) Black must play the first stone on the center point and\n    the second stone cannot be placed in the 5x5 square centered\n    around the first stone.\n\n(5) Renju, the Go-Moku version played by professionals.  White may\n    win with a line of six connected stones, and Black may not make\n    the \"three-three\" nor \"four-four\" shape [Sak81].\n\nResults:\n--------\n\nVictor Allis et al. [AHH93] have demonstrated that Go-Moku is a win for\nBlack (implying that variant (1) is also a win).  Variation (2), above,\nis also a win for Black.\n\nBoth Go-Moku and Variation (2) can be won by the first player in 18\nmoves (35 ply) against optimal defense.  Their solution tree for Go-Moku\ncontained 138,790 positions, while Variation (2) required 153,284 nodes.\n\nThey employed a new search technique, called \"threat space search\", in\nwhich the branching factor for attacking sequences is greatly reduced\nby allowing the defensive side to play *all* direct responses to threats\n(typically two or three moves against each threat of three connected\nstones).  This provides a very fast analysis of sufficient winning\nconditions, but may overlook certain possibilities.  A secondary method\nis used to identify those (relatively uncommon) situations, and a proof\nnumber search is invoked for completeness.\n\nThe computer program Victoria will always win with Black; playing from a\ndatabase until White deviates, then using a threat space search to find\nthe (shorter) forced win.  In the Go-Moku competition at the 1992\nComputer Olympiad (played under the rules of Variation (2)), Victoria\nwon all of its games with Black, plus half of its games with White,\nwhich was sufficient to win the gold medal.  As a result of solving\nGo-Moku, the game will be retired from competition.  This is Allis'\nthird scalp, having solved Connect Four (TM) in 1989, and (resolving)\nQubic (TM) in 1991.\n\nReferences:\n-----------\n\n[Sak81]  G Sakata and W Ikawa, _Five-In-A-Row Renju_, The Ishi Press,\n     Inc.
