His name was Salomon Muller.  His\nfather's name was Joseph Muller and his mother was Sara (Leisten) Muller.\nAre you looking for Mullers or Millers?

(it is their daughter, Shulamith,\nwho is trying to trace the family history.)\n\nTheir father, Joseph, married Sarah Leisten (from Tarnow).  Joseph was from\nLezajsk.\n\nThe story unfolds...\n\nPearl Saban\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: Miller/Muller connections\nAuthor:  &quot;r & p saban&quot; &lt;ronsab@pathcom.com&gt; at INTERNET\nDate:    12/10/97 10:44 PM\n\n\nHello again from Toronto, Canada.\n\nI received your response to my e mail, looked up your \nwebsite (VERY INTERESTING!!! and no doubt a lot of effort\nand time went into the research), and was convinced that\nthere are no links between us.\n\nHOWEVER, today I was visiting my folks and started to \nquestion my mother on some of the names in her family.\nShe gave me some info from her mother's side (Muhlrad) \nand some from her father's side that a cousin in Israel\n(also researching the family tree) supplied her with. \nAnd if my info is of use to you, perhaps I can get you\nin touch with that cousin for more information. (her\nname is Shulamith Bet-Yannai, formerly Winestock, \nnee Citrinbaum)\n\nWell, I was reviewing the info and then plugged back \nonto your website, to the broken Miller branches, \nspecifically Muellers from Strzyzow and Lezajsk, and I\nfound some common information. I quote now from letter \nwritten to my mother in 1992 from that cousin in Israel.\n\n&quot;As you probably know, our grandfather wrote about his \nfather, Shabtai, and mentioned his own grandfather and \ngrandmother, namely isaac and Chaya-Tzvia.  He also \nwrote that Shabtai was born and died in Strzyzow, and \nnot in Lejansk as we thought.  I looked for this place \nat the library and at my great astonishment found a huge\nYizkor book from that shtetl, about 400 pages, half \nHebrew, half Yiddish.  Unfortunately there is nothing \nleft from that community since a fire burst out in 1898\nand all the documents were destroyed.  From what our\ngrandfather wrote, it appears that when he did write \nthose pages, his mother, Fruma, born Licht ,was still \nalive.&quot;\n\nThere is also another letter from the cousin mentioning\nsome different names--\nHauser ; Miriam-Gitche Singer , nee Hauser, and my \ngrandfather were first cousins.  And there were names of\ncousins Feiga, Dora, Kalman and Shmuel who perished in \nthe Holocaust.\n\nSo, I've suddenly become VERY fascinated by the family \nconnections, and hope I can help somehow in your \nresearch.  My mother will supply me with more info if \nnecessary, as will her sister in Chicago.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you...\n\nPearl Saban\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Moishe_Miller@ccmail.prusec.com &lt;Moishe_Miller@ccmail.prusec.com&gt; \nTo: r & p saban &lt;ronsab@pathcom.com&gt;\nDate: Thursday, December 11, 1997 1:34 PM\nSubject: Re: Miller/Muller connections\n\n\n     Hi,\n     I have communicated with Shulamith several times. \n     How are you related to her?

He's over \n80; at least I think that was the last significant b'dayhe had.  Maybe he's\nolder.\nI doubt I can get a death record for Yitchok, but I'll \nsee what's out there. I think my grandfather, Salomon, \nhad written family tree matters, ie. births, deaths, \nmarriages in his Yom Tov machzors; I can  check that out\ntoo.  I'll keep you supplied with info. if there's any \nto be had.\nMany years ago (14 to be exact) I was in Israel and \nvisiting elderly cousins of my mother, no doubt a cousin\nof my mother's father. I remember talking about family \nconnections and she said that it's said that the \nauthor/playwright Arthur Miller is from the family \n(Family resemblances are strong), that his father or was\nit his grandfather, had left Poland decades earlier for\nthe U.S.  Family members have tried to reach him on that\nmatter, but I think he denies it.

My mother's  paternal grandfather, Joseph\nMuller, was the son of Shabsi Muller who married Frimit Licht (I think that's \nhow it goes...)  My mother is from Basel, Switzerland, her parents went there \nafter Poland, etc. (my mom's first cousin is Shulamith Bet-Yannai in \nJerusalem...) Ring any bells...?\n     \nWell, for months, I've been looking back at your site, looking for updates, etc.\n One day, I was reading the dedication names and cross-references, and ended up\nin the Shabsi (Bukovska) Yitzchak Miller Family tree, and was scanning names of \nparents and children, specifically  Avrohm.  I came upon the name of one of his \ndaughter, Tzvetta.  Now, it jumped off the screen for me because I've only heard\nthat name once before -- my cousin had a baby earlier this year and gave that \nmiddle name to her after her late grandmother whom she was quite close to.  I \nread on in the description and saw the names of Tzvetta's kids, one of whom is \nChana Geller.  Well,  this cousin I mentioned is my first cousin's wife; her \nmaiden name was Geller.  She was out of town for the summer, so I couldn't reach\nher to ask her if that's her mother's name.  We found an invitation for that \ncousin's wedding  about 21 years ago, and saw that her mother's name is Chana \nGeller.  Could it be the same one? I wondered for about 3 months.\n     \nWell, tonight after Shabbat was over, I finally got to reach this cousin (Far \nRockaway, NY) by phone, threw out my left field question to her if her \ngrandmother passed away at the listed year, and went on to read the description.\n Lo and behold, yes! Chana Geller is this cousin's mother, Tzvetta was her\ngrandmother and a Miller by birth.\n     \nI don't know if you still consider that the Broken Miller Branches  (from which \nI stem) are part of the big picture, and related, but isn't that weird?  My \nmother was the Muller; she married my dad, an Adler.  That Adler has one sister \nwho has one son. That son married a Geller; that Geller's grandmother had been a\nMiller at birth and on your tree.\n     \nI will be sending my cousin the information and the web site address for the \ntree; she'll be delighted and interested to see it and the photo of Tzvetta that\nyou placed with the description. My cousin, Sara, tells me her mother, Chana, \nwas born in the U.S., not Europe.\n     \nI have heard from others who saw my name on the Jewish Gen. site, and the names \nand places I was curious about.  And yes, I did find other relatives.  Oh, how \nthe world is made a smaller place...\n     \nWishing you and yours all the best for the coming year.  May it be filled with \nlots of good health, happiness, and continued information for your family tree. \nKeep up the good work!\n     \nBest,\n     \n     \nPearl Saban\n---------------------------------------------------------\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Moishe_Miller@ccmail.prusec.com &lt;Moishe_Miller@ccmail.prusec.com&gt; \nTo: r & p saban &lt;ronsab@pathcom.com&gt;\nDate: Tuesday, September 08, 1998 10:01 AM \nSubject: Re: Miller Family Connections\n     \n     \n>     Hi,\n>     Of course I remember, but slowwwww down.

Sara Geller's mother is Chana Geller; Chana is the youngest \ndaughter of Tzvetta, who was born a Miller and married R. Dovid Nusson \nLesser.  Sara had a baby earlier this year, whom she named Adina Tzvetta.\n     \nAs for Joseph Muller... I don't know that he fits into the big tree; he'd be \nan offshoot from that broken Lezansk branch.  My mother is Lilli \nMuller-Adler; her father was Salomon Muller of Tarnow, later of Basel, \nSwitzerland.  Salomon's parents were Joseph and Sara(Leisten) ; Joseph's \nfather was Shabtai, who married Frimit Licht; Shabtai's parents were Yitchok \nand Chaya Tzvia.\n     \nI think my grandfather, Salomon, had written some brief Yahrzeits and \nnames/details in the inside cover of his siddurim and machzorim, but it's in \nGerman, and what my mother could make out of the information just names the \nchildren of Shabsi (Shabtai) and Frimit and brief outlines of who they married \nand number of kids.\n     \nMoishe, I'm such an amateur at this genealogy stuff, I don't even know what \nthose 2 references you mentioned are.  All I've done is ask my mother in the \npast year for names; it's her first cousin in Israel, Shulamith, who's \navidly pursuing this tree for years. I really have no other details, I'm \nsorry.  If my mother finds any other of my grandfather's papers with family \ninformation, I'll be sure to pass it on.  My mother has an older sister \nliving in Chicago (Dr. Esther Kornel), but I don't know if she has any of my \ngrandfather's personal papers; I doubt it, because after my grandmother \ndied, and my grandfather moved from Switzerland to Canada, he lived with us, \nuntil his death in 1965. (I'd just turned 4 at the time)\n     \nIf you've already been in touch with my mother's first cousins here in \nToronto, as you mentioned in a former e-mail, (ie. Ignacz-Irving, I think it \nwas), they must've given you info on their father, Abraham (my grandfather's \nbrother), that they  had.   I wouldn't even know where or how to start \nlooking for more info!\n     \nSincerely,\n     \nPearl\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n</pre>\nSubject: \t\u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d1!<br>\nFrom: \t\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05d5\u05e7\u05e9\u05e4\u05d0\u05df<yb8511@gmail.com><br>\nDate: \tSun, Nov 09, 2014 4:51 am<br>\nTo: \tmoishe@langsam.com<br><br><br>\n\n\n\t\n\u05dc\u05db\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3 \u05de\u05e9\u05d4, \u05e9\u05dc\u05d5\u05dd \u05e8\u05d1!<br><br>\n\n\u05d4\u05d2\u05e2\u05ea\u05d9 \u05dc\u05de\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc \u05e9\u05dc\u05da \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05d4\u05d0\u05ea\u05e8 '\u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05e8 \u05d2\u05e0\u05d0\u05dc\u05d5\u05d2\u05d9\u05d4' \u05d1\u05e7\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d4:<br>\n http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/rpsab.htm<br><br>\n\n\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d1\u05df \u05e9\u05dc \u05de\u05e8\u05ea \u05dc\u05d0\u05d4 \u05de\u05dc\u05d9\u05d0<br>\n \u05d1\u05ea \u05e8' \u05d0\u05dc\u05db\u05e1\u05e0\u05d3\u05e8 \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05e8 \u05d6\"\u05dc<br>\n \u05d1\u05df \u05e8' \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05dc\u05da<br>\n \u05d1\u05df \u05e8' \u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7 \u05de\u05d9\u05dc\u05e8<br>\n \u05d1\u05df \u05e8' \u05e9\u05d1\u05ea\u05d9,<br>\n \u05d1\u05d0\u05ea\u05e8 \u05e9\u05dc\u05da \u05ea\u05de\u05e6\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05de\u05e1' 12,<br>\n \u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05d7\u05e4\u05e9 \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d7\u05d5\u05de\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05de\u05e9\u05e4\u05d7\u05ea\u05d9.<br><br>\n\n\u05d0\u05e9\u05de\u05d7 \u05dc\u05e9\u05de\u05d5\u05e2 \u05e2\u05dc \u05e2\u05d5\u05d3 \u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2.<br><br>\n\n\u05d1\u05ea\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4<br><br>\n\n\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05d5\u05e7\u05e9\u05e4\u05df<br><br><br>\n\n<pre>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n</pre>\n\n\n<P><A HREF=\"hometree.htm\">\n<IMG SRC=\"img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"HOME\"></A><BR><P>\n<HR>\n<P>\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\n<BR>\nMy home address is<PRE>\n           1374 East 28th Street\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\n           USA\n</PRE>\n  \n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=\"-2\">Last updated 7/26/15</FONT>\n<P>\n</td></tr></table>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
