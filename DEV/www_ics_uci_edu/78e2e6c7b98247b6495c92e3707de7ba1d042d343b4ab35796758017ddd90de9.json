I will present \nalgorithms for finding connected and bi-connected components, minimum \nspanning trees and ear decomposition\nin graphs; tree contraction, expression tree evaluation and lowest \ncommon ancestor queries on trees. All these solutions use Euler tour \ntechnique as the building block just like in the PRAM algorithms. \nTherefore, I'll review this technique and simple problems one can solve \nwith it in parallel.\n<p>\nThis is joint work with Lars Arge and Michael Goodrich.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
