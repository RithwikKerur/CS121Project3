He had an interesting take \r\non Pesach.  His family lore has it that Pesach is a direct descendant of \r\nIssachar, son of Jacob.  Though he states that his family is connected \r\nto Pesach Langsam, he does not say how. What he does know is that his \r\ngrandparents were Hersch and Ruchel Langsam from Blazowa.\r\n     \r\nHis father, Aaron, their son, was able to get on an illegal ship from \r\nDanzig to Palestine with about 1300 others.  The boat was captured and \r\ndetained in Yugoslavia and all were shot by the Nazis.  After the war, \r\nthe bodies were exhumed from their mass grave in Sabac, Yugo. and \r\nreburied in a Jewish cemetery in Belgrade.\r\n     \r\nHis mother, Esther and her two sons waited in Danzig for opportunities \r\nto flee.  They left with 500 others, the last to successfully leave, on \r\na train to Bratislava where they picked up a series of boats.  After 3 \r\nmonths they arrived in Haifa.  They were detained.  The 3 year boy died \r\nof typhoid.  Esther and Oscar were exiled to Mauritius until August \r\n1945.  Esther remarried and had two more children. \r\n     \r\nOscar sent a tree but I couldn't read it.  I've asked him to mail it to \r\nme since we've had such difficulty communicating.\r\n     \r\nI've asked him if he knows more about how his grandfather might have \r\nbeen connected to Pesach Langsam's children. As far as I know, his \r\nfamily is not in the book. \r\n     \r\nSuzan\r\n     \r\n\r\nOscar's address is \r\noscar@netvision.net.il\r\n</pre>\r\nOscar has a changing site and this is the <a href=\"oscrsite.htm\">link</a> to the basic information he has posted as I downloaded it. Forgive me, but the images do not load. I did not copy them.\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"HOME\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><font size=\"-2\">Last updated 1/23/00</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n</td></tr></table>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
