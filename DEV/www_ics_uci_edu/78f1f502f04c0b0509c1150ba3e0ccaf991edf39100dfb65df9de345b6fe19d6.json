Are\n&gt; there any sites with more, or sites with historical background on the\n&gt; proofs?\n\nThere is of course a proof in Euclid's Elements, which can be found\nonline in a few places: here is the entry I have from my Geometry\nJunkyard (<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.ici.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/\">http://www.ics.ici.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/</A>), reformatted\nsomewhat from the original HTML:\n\n  Euclid's Elements (<A HREF=\"http://www.columbia.edu/~rc142/Euclid.html\">http://www.columbia.edu/~rc142/Euclid.html</A>).\n  Online, in interesting colors, without all those annoying proofs.\n  Also see D. Joyce's Java-animated version\n  (<A HREF=\"http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html\">http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/elements.html</A>),\n  and a manuscript excerpt from a copy in the Bodleian library made in the\n  year 888 (<A HREF=\"http://www.lib.virginia.edu/science/parshall/elementsamp.html\">http://www.lib.virginia.edu/science/parshall/elementsamp.html</A>).\n\nOf those, Joyce's is the only one likely to have the proof you're looking for.\nHe also has pointers to more online copies of Euclid.\n\nIt wouldn't hurt to try reading a few actual books, too, as well as just\nlooking online -- contrary to appearances there's a lot of knowledge out\nthere that hasn't been put on the web yet.  Most of my geometry books\nare in my office, but I just took a look at The Penguin Dictionary of\nCurious and Interesting Geometry, by David Wells, which has the exact\ncitation to Euclid (book I, prop. 47), gives a Chinese proof from before\n200BC, and says \"far more proofs have been offered of Euclid's theorem\nthan of any other proposition in mathematics\" (maybe true but it's\nhardly the only statement with many proofs; see e.g. my page on Euler's\nformula, <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/</A>).  Wells does\nlist several other proofs and gives citations for more including a 1940\nbook with 367 of them!\n\nSome more historical background on the Pythagorean theorem can be found\nin Dirk Struik's Consise History of Mathematics, which includes for\ninstance a statement that there is no evidence of ancient Egyptian\nknowledge of the theorem (contra folklore that they used 3-4-5 triangles\nto measure right angles).  Struik does say though that the theorem was\nknown to the Babylonians and ancient Chinese, although \"the first\ngeneral proof may have been obtained in the Pythagorean school\".\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Sat, 13 Sep 1997 00:13:39 -0400\n<B>From:</B>           Godfried Toussaint &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:godfried@cs.mcgill.ca\">godfried@cs.mcgill.ca</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        Pythagoream proofs\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nHi David,\n\nI found this on your plane geometry page.\n\n<A HREF=\"mailto:alexl@daemon.cna.tek.com\">alexl@daemon.cna.tek.com</A> (Alexander writes:\n&gt; The theorem of Pythagoras is said to have many proofs.\n&gt; I've found four on the WWW (used with the Geometers SketchPad).
