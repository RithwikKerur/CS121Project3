I took some\r\nextra time to document it and I want to share it, since I think that\r\nmaybe next generations could benefit from it (at least as reference for\r\nthose without much coding experience).\r\n\r\nI have attached the necessary files to execute it. The file\r\ntest/connectNTest/GameTest.java contains the main method and shows how\r\nto execute the framework.\r\n\r\nEssentially, a specialization of the class Player in \"src/players\" can\r\nrepresent any kind of player, and then can be called in GameTest.java to\r\nplay against other kinds of player (including human). At the end of a\r\ntournament a short summary of time and results is print to standard\r\noutput.\r\n\r\nHope it will be useful somehow.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nDavid Carrillo\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
