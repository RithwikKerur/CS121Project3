This\r\nfocuses on a comparative empirical examination of four different communities\r\nincluding that centered on Internet infrastructure, X-ray astronomy and\r\ndeep space imaging, academic software design research, and networked computer\r\ngames (NCG). In the NCG world, I am particularly interested in the development\r\nand deployment of open source game \"mods\", career contingencies of game\r\nmod'ers, grrl gaming, and how the processes and practices of the NCG world\r\nare similar to and different from the other communities in the study. I\r\nhave been focusing attention to particular game worlds associated with\r\n<i>Unreal\r\n</i>(including <i>Half-Life, Dr. Action, and Unreal Tournament</i>),\r\n<i>Quake\r\nArena</i>, <i>Neverwinter Nights</i>, <i>Everquest</i>, and <i>The Sims</i>.\r\nI have also recently submitted a <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~wscacchi/Papers/New/ResearchSummary.pdf\">proposal</a>\r\nto NSF for a new study that seeks to investigate how NCG systems can be\r\nopened, modified, or extended to serve as a \"work practices simulator\".\r\nA WPS is a NCG system that supports the modeling and situated interaction\r\nof complex technical work activities (e.g., conducting astrophysical observations\r\nusing a national virtual observatory, setting up a LAN party, or conducting\r\nan internet-based chat meeting), based on data, socio-technical actions,\r\nand hyperlinked artifacts collected in my open source project.\r\n<p><b><i><font face=\"Arial\">Emerging Interest in Persistent Game Worlds\r\nand New Media Arts: </font></i>Game Grids</b>\r\n<br>I have an interest in participating in the design, prototyping, use,\r\nand community evolution of <i>game grids</i>. A <a href=\"http://www.cacr.caltech.edu/cluster2001/program/talks/walker.pdf\">grid</a>\r\n(e.g. <a href=\"http://www-fp.mcs.anl.gov/fl/accessgrid/\">Access Grid</a>)\r\ncan be a network/cluster of possibly heterogeneous NCG systems that collectively\r\nenable the (re)composition of geographically dispersed groups of game/NMA\r\nparticipants into virtual organizations that can share infrastructure and\r\nexchange resources for collective interests. Game grids should enable a\r\ngroup of interested artists/others to rapidly form persistent, NGC worlds\r\nusing open source and peer-to-peer resource sharing techniques for diverse\r\ncultural expressions. Game grids may be mobile, decentralized, and potentially\r\nanonymous. Game grids may also represent an approach that accommodates\r\nthe collective development of persistent game worlds of <i>extraordinary\r\nscale and scope</i> (ESS). ESS is meant to point to future scenarios where\r\nhundreds of thousands of participants might join a given grid (e.g., for\r\na <a href=\"http://www.quakecon.org/about.html\">QuakeCon</a> tournament,\r\na real-time visual art performance, or a community <a href=\"http://www.ancestralfilms.org/festival_childrensprogram_animationworkshop.html\">anijam</a>).\r\nYet, to achieve Game Grids fostering ESS will require interdisciplinary\r\nresearch into matters like how to achieve <i>extraordinary ease of development\r\nfor content, system, and virtual organization</i>, and how to rapidly create\r\n<i>high\r\nperformance users and usage scenarios</i>. Advances in techniques such\r\nas these would enable collateral advances in other realms of scientific,\r\nengineering, and artistic practice and collaboration. I believe that the\r\nCalIT(2) project can expand its agenda and resources, as well as engage\r\nindustry/government sponsors, around an emerging interdisciplinary focus\r\non game grids.\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
