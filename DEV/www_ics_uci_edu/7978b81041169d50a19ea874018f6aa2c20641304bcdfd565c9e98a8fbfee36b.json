Then, the sliding token problem is to determine whether there\nexists a sequence of independent sets which transforms $I_b$ into $I_r$ so\nthat each independent set in the sequence results from the previous\none by sliding exactly one token along an edge in the graph. This\nproblem is known to be PSPACE-complete even for planar graphs, and\nalso for bounded treewidth graphs. In this talk, we thus study the\nproblem restricted to trees, and give the following three results:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the decision problem is solvable in linear time;</li>\n<li>for a\nyes-instance, we can find in quadratic time an actual sequence of\nindependent sets between $I_b$ and $I_r$ whose length (i.e., the number of\ntoken-slides) is quadratic; and</li>\n<li>there exists an infinite family of\ninstances on paths for which any sequence requires quadratic\nlength.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Based\non <a href=\"http://erikdemaine.org/papers/TokenReconfigurationTrees_TCS2015/\">a\npaper from ISAAC 2014 and <i>Theoretical Computer Science</i> 2015</a> by Demaine, Demaine, Fox-Epstein, Hoang, Ito, Ono, Otachi, Uehara, and Yamada.)</p>\n\n</body></html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
