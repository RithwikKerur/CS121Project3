The conference is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results, systems and techniques in the broad field of recommender systems. Such systems, as part of broader information filtering system networks, attempt to predict user preferences and ratings for items by exploiting users&#8217; past behaviors. Their use has surged in popularity in recent years. \n</p>\n<p>\nAccording to the <a href=\"http://recsys.acm.org/\">website</a>, the conference &#8220;will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their latest results and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components in a range of innovative application contexts.&#8221; Netflix&#8217;s chief product officer Neil Hunt will deliver the keynote speech, titled &#8220;Quantifying the Value of Better Recommendations.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nKobsa praised Silicon Valley as an ideal location for RecSys 2014, saying that it &#8220;allows local high-tech industry to learn about the most recent research results in recommender technology.&#8221; Attracting local industry has proved successful: Tickets to the conference sold out before the early registration deadline.\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p><a name=\"summer_2014_nicolau_and_veidenbaum_published_in_computing_retrospective\"></a><b>Nicolau and Veidenbaum published in computing retrospective</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Alex Nicolau\" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/anicolau.jpg\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><b> Alex <br/> Nicolau </b></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Alex Veidenbaum\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/aveidenb.jpg\"/>\n<p><b> Alex <br/> Veidenbaum </b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\nComputer science chair <strong>Alex Nicolau</strong> and professor <strong>Alex Veidenbaum</strong> have each been published in the 25th anniversary volume of the International Conference on Supercomputing.

Tsotras, a professor at the University of California, Riverside. AsterixDB promises to be the most versatile among platforms aimed at managing Big Data; the open source software is now available for free download at \n<a href=\"http://asterix.ics.uci.edu\">http://asterix.ics.uci.edu</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe AsterixDB engine operates on a &#8220;shared nothing&#8221; architecture, in which each computer node is independent and self-sufficient. Its distinct advantages come by adding management of semi-structured data (data not organized in the traditional tabular form), supporting a variety of data types (e.g., spatial and temporal as well as textual and numeric data), and borrowing techniques from parallel databases that increase the speed and scale at which it can operate.\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p><a name=\"winter_2014_sadowski_zeller_sbv_improver_competition\"></a><b>ICS grad students take second place in sbv IMPROVER competition</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Peter Sadowski\" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/noteworthy/PeterSadowski.JPG\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><b>Peter<br/>Sadowski</b></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Michael Zeller\" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/noteworthy/MichaelZeller.jpg\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><b>Michael<br/>Zeller</b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<strong>Peter Sadowski</strong> and <strong>Michael Zeller</strong>, both Ph.D. students with the Department of Computer Science, earned a second-place finish in an international data-mining competition.

Their pipeline consisted of two parts: an artificial neural network; and a statistical analysis that aggregated evidence from the replicated measurements. They placed second out of 13 teams and were awarded travel-cost reimbursement to the 2013 sbv IMPROVER Symposium in Athens, Greece, where they presented their findings.\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p><a name=\"winter_2014_judith_and_gary_olson_release_new_book_on_distributed_collaborations\"></a><b>Judith and Gary Olson release new book on distributed collaborations</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Judith Olson\" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/jsolson.jpg\"/>\n<p><b>Judith<br/>Olson</b></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Gary Olson\" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/golson.jpg\"/>\n<p><b>Gary<br/>Olson</b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\nProfessors <strong>Judith Olson</strong> and <strong>Gary Olson</strong> have \n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Working-Together-Apart-Collaboration-Human-Cenered/dp/1608450503\">published a new book</a>, \ntitled <em>Working Together Apart: Collaboration over the Internet</em>. Published by Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, the Olsons&#8217; new offering reviews the latest insights into how teams work together when they are not in the same location. \n</p>\n<p>\nGuided by a framework they developed during two decades of research on this topic, the professors organize a series of factors they have found to differentiate between successful and unsuccessful distributed collaborations. They then review the kinds of technology options that are available today, focusing more on types of technologies rather than specific instances. They describe a database of geographically distributed projects they have studied and introduce the Collaboration Success Wizard, an online tool for assessing past, present, or planned distributed collaborations. The book closes with a set of recommendations for individuals, managers, and those higher in the organizations who wish to support distance work.\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<hr/>\n<p><b>FALL 2013</b></p>\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<!-- -->\n<p><a name=\"fall_2013_access_features_regans_article_on_vehicular_communication_networks\"></a><b>ACCESS features Regan&#8217;s article on vehicular communication networks</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Amelia Regan\" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/aregan.jpg\"/>\n<p><b>Amelia<br/>Regan</b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\nIn the latest issue of \n<a href=\"http://www.uctc.net/access/43/access.shtml\">ACCESS Magazine</a>, professor <strong>Amelia Regan</strong> explores the implications of vehicular communication networks.
