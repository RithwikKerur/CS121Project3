To came Theuth and showed his inventions, desiring\nthat the other Egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of\nthe he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about their several\nuses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he approved\nor disapproved of them.\n<P>\nIt would take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in\npraise or blame of the various arts. But when they came to letters,\nThis, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better\nmemories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit.\n<P>\nThamus replied:\n<BR>\nO most ingenious Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not\nalways the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own\ninventions to the users of them. And in this instance, you who\nare the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own\nchildren have been led to attribute to them a quality which they\ncannot have; for this discovery of yours will create\nforgetfulness in the learners' souls, because they will not use\ntheir memories; they will trust to the external written\ncharacters and not remember of themselves.\n<P>\nThe specific which you\nhave discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and\nyou give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of\ntruth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned\nnothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally\nknow nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of\nwisdom without the reality.\n</blockquote>\n\n<P>\n<HR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin\"><address>franklin@uci.edu</address></A>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
