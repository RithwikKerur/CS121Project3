Both seem to be addressing scalable independent names that wont\nconflict.&nbsp; You deploy faster but wind up with the scaling issue.&nbsp;\nIt's misleading to say it's better.\n<p><b>Sam Sun:</b> It's a trade-off. The client does some processing instead\nof relying on the server. Not the same model as thin client.\n<br>Handle provides a service that provides more information than just\na server.&nbsp; Trade off is more work.&nbsp; But it allows more servers\nto service the namespace.\n<p><b>Q:</b> Handle is only available as a binary release.&nbsp; Is there\nany intent to make source available?\n<p><b>Sam Sun:</b> Binaries for local service is suppose to be source.\nAnd for the client.&nbsp; People had trouble building them so we distributed\nthe binaries instead.&nbsp; There is an issue on how much of the total\ncode we distribute.\n<p><b>Sam Sun:</b> The software itself relies on a single root service,\nsingle root service can be replicated and distributed within a site. Primary\nservice.&nbsp; Multiple primary sites.&nbsp; Registration can take place\nat multiple sites\n<p><b>Daniel LaLiberte:</b> Single admin root? How can the whole namespace\nbe divided up administratively?&nbsp; For example, UCI can service everything\nin global sense but why should people trust US servers to do the right\nthing?\n<p><b>Sam Sun:</b> Lots to do with the policies issues.&nbsp; Issues of\nownership? When two departments merge, what to do?&nbsp; We don\u2019t have\na solution.\n<br>&nbsp;\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
