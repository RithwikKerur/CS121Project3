Taylor is a Professor Emeritus of Information\n     and Computer Sciences at the <a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">University\n     of  California at Irvine</a> and a member of the Department of Informatics\n     (of which he was chair from its founding in January of 2003 through June,\n     2004). He received the Ph.D. degree in <a href=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/\">Computer\n      Science</a> from the University of Colorado at Boulder in 1980. His research\n       interests are centered on design and software architectures, especially\n      event-based and \n  peer-to-peer systems and the way they scale across organizational boundaries.\n       Professor Taylor was the Director of the <a href=\"http://www.isr.uci.edu/\">Institute\n        for Software Research</a> from 1999 through 2017, which is dedicated to fostering innovative\n        basic  and applied research in software and information technologies\n        through partnerships \n  with industry and government. He has served as chairman of ACM's Special Interest\n         Group on Software Engineering, <a href=\"http://www.acm.org/sigsoft/\">SIGSOFT</a>,\n          chairman of the steering committee for the <a href=\"http://www.icse-conferences.org/\">International\n           Conference on Software Engineering</a>, and was general chair of the\n           1999 International  Joint Conference on Work Activities, Coordination,\n           and Collaboration and the <a href=\"http://www.isr.uci.edu/FSE-12/\">2004\n           International Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering</a>.\n           He was  the General Chair for the <a href=\"http://2011.icse-conferences.org/\">2011\n           International Conference on Software Engineering</a>,  held in Honolulu, Hawaii, May 2011.</p>\n<p>Taylor was a 1985 recipient of a Presidential\n             Young Investigator Award and in 1998 was recognized as an <a href=\"http://www.acm.org/awards/fellows_citations_n-z/taylorr.html\">ACM\n               Fellow</a>. In 2005 he was awarded the <a href=\"http://www.sigsoft.org/awards/disSerAwd.htm\">ACM\n               SIGSOFT Distinguished Service Award</a>. In May 2008 he received\n               ICSE's &quot;<a href=\"http://www.sigsoft.org/awards/mostInfPapAwd.htm\">Most\n               Influential Paper Award</a>&quot;, along with \n               co-authors Peyman Oreizy and Nenad Medvidovic, for &quot;<a href=\"http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=302181\">Architecture-based\n               runtime software evolution</a>&quot; from ICSE 1998. In May, 2009\n               he was recognized with the 2009 <a href=\"http://www.sigsoft.org/awards/outResAwd.htm\">ACM\n               SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award</a>. In February 2010 he was\n               designated a University of California, Irvine <a href=\"http://www.ap.uci.edu/distinctions/titles.html\">Chancellor's\n               Professor</a>. In 2012 he received the Dean's Award for Excellence in Research, and in 2017 was granted  a Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award by the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>\n<p> A PDF version of my October 2016 <a href=\"taylor-october-2016.pdf\">resume</a>. <br/>\n</p>\n\n<hr/>\n<h1>Software Engineering</h1>\n<h2> Archival Events of Note</h2>\n<ul>\n  <li>Keynote talk at ESEC/FSE 2009 (Amsterdam), for the 2009 ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding\n    Research Award (<a href=\"ESEC-FSE-Taylor.pdf\">slides</a> 13.7Mb)<br />\n    <br />\n  </li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://2011.icse-conferences.org/\">2011 International Conference on Software Engineering: ICSE '11<br />\n    <br />\n  </a><a href=\"http://2011.icse-conferences.org\"><img src=\"http://2011.icse-conferences.org/sites/icse2011/files/publicity/ICSE2011-Surfer-Logo.png\" border=\"0\"  alt=\"ICSE 2011\" title=\"ICSE 2011\" /></a><a href=\"http://2011.icse-conferences.org\"><img src=\"http://2011.icse-conferences.org/sites/icse2011/files/publicity/ICSE2011-Surfboard-Logo.png\" border=\"0\"  alt=\"ICSE 2011\" title=\"ICSE 2011\" /></a><br />  \n    <br />\n    <br />\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<hr/>\n<p><a name=\"irus\"></a> </p>\n<h1> Institute for Software Research (<a href=\"http://www.isr.uci.edu/\">ISR</a>) \n</h1>\n\n<p>\nEstablished in July 1999, the University of California's Institute for Software \n  Research (ISR) is dedicated to\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> fostering innovative basic and applied research in software and information \n    technologies; </li>\n  <li>working with established companies, startups, government agencies, and standards \n    bodies to develop and transition the technologies to widespread and practical \n    application; </li>\n  <li>educating the next generation of software researchers and practitioners \n    in advanced software technologies; </li>\n  <li>supporting the public service mission of the University of California in \n    developing the economic basis of the State of California. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nThe Institute's activities are focused on: \n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Direct support of research projects, including funding personnel </li>\n  <li>Research support services (administrative services)</li>\n  <li>Conference and seminar services </li>\n  <li>Technology transition</li>\n</ul>\nThe Institute extends beyond the boundaries of UC Irvine and includes faculty\nfrom a variety of institutions.
