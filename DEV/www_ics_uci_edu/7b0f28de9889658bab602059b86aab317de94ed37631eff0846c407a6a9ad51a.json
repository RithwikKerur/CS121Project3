In a prior talk\nwe presented an O(n log n) expected-time algorithm for the case when d\nis a fixed constant and c is not required to be one of the input points.\nIn this talk we consider the case when d=2 and c is constrained to be\none of the input points.  We present an O(n 2<sup>&alpha;(n)</sup> log<sup>2</sup> n)\nexpected-time solution to this problem, which uses the algorithm for the\nunconstrained case as a component.\n\n<p>\nThis is a joint work of David Eppstein and Kevin Wortman.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
