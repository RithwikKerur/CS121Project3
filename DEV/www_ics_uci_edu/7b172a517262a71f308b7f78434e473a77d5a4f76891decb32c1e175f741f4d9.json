I think the document does an excellent \njob of addressing the main issues while leaving minor ones to be squabbled \nover later. However I am definitely itching to get into the blood and guts \nof how we intend to implement this stuff.\n\nI noticed that partial writes were not addressed. If I am editing a 10 \nmegabyte file and want to change a single word I am forced to upload the \nentire file. With partial writes I can just change the areas I am \ninterested in.\n\nWe also need to address an issue I neglected to address in my original \ndocument - Insertion Writes. I have added the following sentence to section \n1, Partial [Read | Write] in my needs document: \"In addition a mechanism is \nneeded to do insert writes such that one can specify that a section of \nbytes should be inserted into the file at a specified position.\"\n\nSection 1. Source retrieval\nThe connection between 'presentation' and 'source' isn't straight forward. \nFor example, what is the source of a program? The obvious answer would be \nthe source code but what about the object files? There should be mention of \nthese complex relationships and the possibility that the path from \npresentation to source may be linear with many nodes or may have many \nbranches. I admit my bias here in thinking that the whole issue of \"Get for \nEdit\" should be absorbed into Section 5 - Relationships.\n\nSections 2 &amp; 3 - Locks and Independence of Locks\nI realize I am perilously close to nit picking but I am uncomfortable with \nthe use of the word Lock in this context. Especially in light of point 4. I \nrealize that Check Out is a loaded term because different systems implement \nit in different ways but Lock is an equally loaded term.\nA more substantial issue is partial write locks. Industrial strength \ndistributed authoring involves large files with complex structures. Partial \nwrite locks are necessary if we are going to have several different authors \nmunging through the same file. This issue becomes even more relevant when \ndatabases are shared.\n\nSection 7.\nThis is just an editing point but I think the wording of the last paragraph \nin this section should read \"FrontPage from Microsoft also...\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYaron\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0123.html\">Murray Maloney: \"Re: Seiwald Q &amp; A -- \"GET for EDIT\" cookies\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0121.html\">Yaron Goland: \"Security Features\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
