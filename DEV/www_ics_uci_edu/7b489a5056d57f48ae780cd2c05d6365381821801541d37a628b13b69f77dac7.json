Say that you\nfold it along a line AB where A and B are the endpoints, and where\nthe line AB is included in the paper before folding. (If there is\na hole in the paper or the paper is non-convex, AB may pass over a\nregion which is not included in AB. We will deal with this later.)\n\nNow, AB is included in the paper. When folding along AB, the\ncircumference is increase by AB due to the folding. The two\ncomponents of the paper each have circumference that go from A to B:\nie. you may follow the circumference of any component from A to B.\nWhen folding this, you get a new circumference: the outermost of\nthese. We may however follow the part of the original circumference\nthat falls inside the folded paper. This, too, gives a curve from A\nto B and must therefore have length at least AB. Hence, though we\ngain AB, we loose more than AB.\n\nIf the line AB is not fully contained in the paper, you may let\nthe intersections between AB and the circumference of the original\npaper by P_1, ..., P_2n (n components of AB). The 'inner\ncricumferences' as were constructed above will arise here to, but\nwill connect pairs of points P_i (not neccesarily neighboring points).\nThe conclusion follows as above.\n\nEinar\n\n-- \nEinar Andreas Rodland               E-mail: <A HREF=\"mailto:einara@math.uio.no\">einara@math.uio.no</A>\nUniversity of Oslo, Norway\nDepartement of Mathematics          <A HREF=\"http://www.math.uio.no/~einara\">http://www.math.uio.no/~einara</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           Danny Calegari &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:dannyc@math.berkeley.edu\">dannyc@math.berkeley.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math.research\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: The Margulis Napkin Problem\n<B>Date:</B>           Sat, 02 Mar 1996 04:11:16 -0800\n<B>Organization:</B>   UC Berkeley\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nEinar Andreas Rodland wrote:\n\n&gt; . .

If your paper likes to stick to\nitself so much that after any fold you may again consider yourself to have\nonly a single thickness of paper, the above argument works as advertised.\nHowever, even the most trivial of origami folds (including a mountain fold\nsomewhere, for example) requires that the paper be partially unfolded at \nsome point.  Not all flat folded shapes are achievable from simple folds\nof the type outlined above.  Now, if someone wants to show that the \n*shadow* of any flat folded figure is achievable with the shadow of a \nfigure including only simple folds, the above is the required final step.\nHowever, I don't believe that part about shadow achievability.  :-)\nI think a proof would have to consider an arbitrarily folded flat figure\nand the prover should be careful with any inductions used.\nDoug  --  <A HREF=\"mailto:lepro@math.wisc.edu\">lepro@math.wisc.edu</A>\n--\nDouglas R.

When you flatten the sea Urchin, portions of each \n  point overlap neighboring points, reducing the total perimeter. And I can't \n  get the bird base trick to work either, at least not without little tears \n  appearing in the edges of the paper as the points spread apart.  Can you \n  check your theory, and give more specific instructions?\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nI added the asterisks to my original comments to emphasize an important \npoint; if you're really going to try this, you definitely have to thin the \npoints, or as Jeannine points out, you'll lose perimeter due to the regions \nwhere the points overlap. The thinner you make the flaps, the less you \nlose. And in fact, as you'll see below, you have to thin them a _lot_ just \nto reach break-even.\n\nTo quantify this and to provide a specific example in the case of the Bird \nBase, take a unit square (I get these from OUSA Supplies) and fold a Bird \nBase in the all-flaps-down position (kite-shaped). Denote the height of the \ntop triangle by z (z is (Sqrt(2)-1)/2, but that's not important to the \nargument). Now narrow all four long flaps (and the top flap) by sinking the \n_sides_ in and out on parallel creases, dividing each side into nths. After \nsinking, spread-sink one flap on each side, so you end up with a real \nskinny thing with one flap pointing upward and two flaps on the left and \nright pointing down. Reverse-fold two of the downward-pointing flaps out to \neach side, and spread the two remaining downward-pointing flaps slightly so \nthere is a gap between them.\n\nNow, your shape lies completely flat and has four long flaps and one \nshorter one. Because of overlapping layers, each of the long flaps, which \nideally would have a perimeter of slightly more than (1), has lost (2z/n) \nin length. The top flap has a perimeter slightly over (2z). So the total \nperimeter of the shape is 4(1-2z/n)+2z = 4 + 2z(1-4/n) (actually a teensy \nbit more because of some angled edges, which I'm neglecting for now).\n\nSo if you compare this to the perimeter of the original square, you see \nthat for n=4, you've just about broken even; but if you divide into 5ths or \nmore, you'll come out ahead. And if you make the points \"arbitrarily thin\", \nwhich only occurs in pure mathematics and Origami Insects And Their Kin, \nthe perimeter of the Bird Base shape approaches the value 4+2z, or about \n4.414. Similar arguments (and many more sinks) apply to the Sea Urchin.\n\nRobert J. Lang\n<A HREF=\"mailto:rjlang@aol.com\">rjlang@aol.com</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
