It has been \nobserved that average global surface and atmospheric temperatures have been \nsteadily increasing since the beginning of this century.  These observations \nare conclusive; however, the evidence to support a cause for global warming is \nnot quite so certain.  Green house gases, such as methane and carbon dioxide \nare <i>believed</i> to be the most significant cause of the global warming \ntrend.  \"External processes, such as solar irradance variations, variations of \nthe Earth's orbital parameters (eccentricity, precession, and inclination), \nlithosphere motions, and volcanic activity, are factors in climatic \nvariation\"<A HREF=\"http://spso.gsfc.nasa.gov/eos_glossary/cli.html\">(1)</A> as \nwell.  Also, the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer is thought to contribute \nsignificantly to global climate change.  Regardless of the causes of global \nwarming, the <i>effects</i> upon the Earth's climate are potentially \ndisasterous.  It is imperitive that we take action concerning \nthese issues, but what can be done and how are the questions facing our world \nleaders today.  The United Nations has addressed concerns about global warming \nand climate change via the <A HREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/unfccc/fca6e.html\">UN \nFramework Convention on Climate Change</A>.  The initiatives and actions \nagreed upon therein are promising, but many more positive results must be \nobtained before concerns about global warming and climate change should \nsubside.\n\n<p>     \"The rise in global mean temperature of about 0.6 degrees Celsius \nover the last 140 years representsthe major piece of observational \nevidence in the global warming debate.\"<A \nHREF=\"http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/annrep93/globtemp.htm\">(2)</A>  The \n\"debate\" is not about whether or not the average global temperatures have \nincreased over the past century (clearly they have increased), but over \nsuch concerns as:\n<ul> \n<li>Is the data collected on global warming sufficient to infer that we \nshould be concerned about it's effects on climate?     \n<li>What really are the causes of global warming and climate change?\n<li>What can be done to slow or stop the process of global warming?\n</ul>\n<p>     Although \"all major climate models agree that the clearest \nsymptom of climate change would be a global warming... global temperature \nrecords exist only for the past century or so.\"<A \nHREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs005.html\">(3)</A>  Since we can not base \nglobal warming and climate change theories on prior records, we are left \nwith uncertain models pertaining to the effects of global warming and \nclimate change.  The observed global temperature increase is small enough \nto have been caused by natural variability, but it is also possible that \nnatural variability has hidden (temporarily) the climatic effects of \ngreen house gas emmissions.  Possible errors in measuring global warming \ntrends may underestimate or exaggerate the occurance, which could \ngive us inaccurate results.  Scepticism and criticism aside, scientific \nmodels of the Earth's atmosphere <i>do</i> suggest that there is probable \ncause for concern regarding global warming and climate change.\n<p>     \"The size of the observed warming is compatible with what \nclimate models suggest should have resulted from past green house gas \nemissions.\"<A HREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs005.html\">(4)</A>  Green \nhouse gas emission is the most popular explanation for the occurance of \nglobal warming because of the fact that these gases are capable of \ntrapping solar radiation within the Earth's atmosphere which would \notherwise be released into space.  The major greenhouse gases are:\n<ul>\n<li>carbon dioxide\n<li>methane\n<li>chlorofluorocarbons\n</ul>\n<p>     Carbon dioxide is the most prevailent green house gas put into the \natmosphere by man made processes.  \"The main source of carbon dioxide \nis fossil feul emissions.\"<A \nHREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs002.html\">(5)</A>  Deforestation is \nalso a contributer to carbon dioxide emission.  The biggest problem \nwith deforestation may not be the levels of carbon dioxide emitted by \nburning forests (a \"source\").  In the future, deforestation could prove \nto be most relevant in that it significantly impairs the process by \nwhich carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere, photosynthesis (a \n\"sink\").  The complex carbon cycle is steadily changing as carbon \ndioxide levels rise above their natural levels within the atmosphere.  \nThis change is causing an imbalance between the sources and sinks for \ncarbon dioxide, which is resulting in more carbon dioxide emission than \nremoval, and thus, trapping solar radiation--raising the mean global \ntemperature.  Also, carbon dioxide is chemically stable, which means \nthat it will remain in the atmosphere for many decades after it is \nreleased, if it is not removed by a sink.  Methane is not as stable as \ncarbon dioxide, as it is more easily destroyed by chemical reactions in \nthe atmosphere.  This green house gas, although not as abundant as \ncarbon dioxide, is much more efficient at trapping solar radiation so \nthat it does not take as much to trap the same amount of heat.  \n\"Converting land to agriculture, particularly rice paddies, releases \nmethane.  So do deforestation, coal mining, and the extraction and use \nof natural gas.\"<A HREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs002.html\">(6)</A>  \nOf the major green house gases, the most chemically stable are \nchlorofluorocarbons.  These gases will remain in the atmosphere for up \nto 100 years once released, and are even more efficient at trapping \nsolar radiation than methane.  It is not clear, however, what the net \ngreen house gas effect of chlorofluorocarbon is, because it is also responsible for \ndepleting the stratospheric ozone layer, which also inhibits solar \nradiation from escaping the atmosphere.<A \nHREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs031.html\">(7)</A>  A decrease in \nozone, however, allows more intense solar radiation to enter the \nEarth's atmosphere (mainly UV radiation) which could also cause an \nincrease in global temperature.  The main concern over depleted \nozone in the stratosphere is an increase in human vulnerability to \nskin cancer due to intence UV ratiation.  Photochemical smog \nproduced by hydroelectric power generation generates ozone in the \ntroposphere, which also traps heat near the Earth's surface.\n<p>     Regardless of the controversy over the causes of global \nwarming and climate change, enough concern has been generated over the issue to warrant \nmajor political conventions and scientific research efforts designed \nto deal with the phenomonon.  The concern is that global climate \nchange could be causing, and exponentially exacerbate, \noccurances of climatic extreems and natural disasters which \nprove to be devestating to human life and society.  \"Frequent \nreports of record-breaking events suggest that climate extremes \nare becoming more common.\"<A \nHREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/iucc/fs105.html\">(8)</A>  These \nclimatic extremes are especially effecting areas of the world \nwith high density populations, leaving many people extreemly \nvulnerable to loss of life and/or property.  One example is that \nof increase in sea level at coastal areas.  As the temperature \nof the Earth increases, polar ice caps are subject to melting, \nreceding coast lines throughout the world.  Since the most \ndensly populated areas in the world are near coast lines, such a \nphenomenon could prove to be extreemly disasterous.  If there is \nanything that we can do to stop the process of global warming \nand climate change, it is in our best interest to do so.  \n<p>     Ideas and proposals for solutions are being sought by \nthe international community.  Just over a year ago, global \nwarming made headlines world-wide when 154 Governments at the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ciesin.org/datasets/unced/unced.html\">Rio Earth \nSummit</A> signed a major environmental treaty, <A \nHREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/unfccc/fca6e.html\">the UN Framework on Climate \nChange</A>.  There are so many interests to consider, and so \nmany questions to be answered concerning the causes and effects \nof global warming and climate change, that the international \ncommunity is faced with a grave challange in resolving the \nproblems and potential catastrophe's involved.  \"The 1992 \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\nis one of a series of recent agreements through which countries\naround the world are banding together to meet this challenge.\"<A \nHREF=\"http://www.unep.ch/iucc/begincon.html\">(9)</A>  Although such \ninternational forums have made significant progress on the issue of \nglobal warming and climate change,  there is a considerable amount of \nprogress yet to come if there is any hope of finding solutions.\n\n             \n\n\n\n</BODY>\n\n</HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
