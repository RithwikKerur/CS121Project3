Hurtado, M. Noy, and J.\nUrrutia, from Computational Geometry '96. This paper covers three\nproblems, so I plan on covering two of them in detail, and showing\nsome examples of the other. \n\n<p>In this paper we study the problem of flipping edges in\ntriangulations of polygons and point sets. We prove that if a\npolygon Qn has k reflex vertices, then any triangulation T of Qn\ncan be transformed to another triangulation T' of Qn by flipping at\nmost O(n&nbsp;+&nbsp;k<sup>2</sup>) edges. We produce examples of\npolygons with triangulations T and T' such that to transform T to\nT' requires O(n<sup>2</sup>) flips. These results are then extended\nto triangulations of point sets. We also show that any\ntriangulation of an n point set contains at least\n(n&nbsp;-&nbsp;4)&nbsp;/&nbsp;2 edges that can be flipped.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
