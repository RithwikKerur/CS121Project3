align=\"left\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Install a new version of Eclipse to use with MinGW C++</b>\r\n<p>\r\nMinGW means <b>Min</b>imalist <b>G</b>NU for <b>W</b>indows: GNU is a source\r\n  of open source programming tools (GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix).\r\n<p>\r\nBefore starting this handout, you should have first downloaded the files\r\n  needed by <a href=\"mingw.html\" target=\"_blank\">MinGW C++</a>.\r\nNow you will download a version of Eclipse that is already set up to use\r\n  MinGW.\r\n<p>\r\nYou may want to print these instructions before proceeding, so that you can\r\n  refer to them while downloading and installing MinGW and Eclipse.\r\nOr, just keep this document in your browser.\r\nYou should read each step completely before performing the action that it\r\n  describes.\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"100%\">\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2>Eclipse: Version 4.4 (Luna)</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse download requires about 200 MB of disk space; keep it on your\r\n  machine, in case you need to re-install Eclipse.\r\nWhen installed, Eclipse requires an additional 200 MB of disk space.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Downloading Eclipse</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Click\r\n    <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/index.php\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n      Eclipse</a><p>\r\n    The top of the following page will appear in your browser.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/eclipsedownloadpage0.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    In this handout we will download <b>Eclipse Standard 4.4</b> for\r\n      Windows 32 Bit (the current version is 4.5 Mars); if your computer uses\r\n        Windows, continue below; otherwise\r\n        look for the pull-down list showing <b>Windows</b> and instead choose\r\n        either <b>Mac OS X (Cocoa)</b> or <b>Linux</b> and then continue below.\r\n    <p>\r\n    It is critical that Java, MinGW, and Eclipse are either all 32 Bit or are\r\n       all 64 Bit (and only if your Machine/OS supports 64 Bit): I think it\r\n       easiest to use 32 Bit for everything.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the <b>Windows 32 Bit</b> Operating System for your machine,\r\n      under the heading <b>Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers</b> (the fourth\r\n      selection from the top).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/eclipsedownloadpage.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    You will see the following page (don't worry about the name of the\r\n      institution to the right of the big downward pointing arrow).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/mirror.jpg\">\r\n     \r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click the big downward pointing arrow underneath the\r\n      <b>Download eclipse-cpp-luna-R-win32.zip from:</b>\r\n    The site named here, in purple to the right of the arrow:\r\n      <b>[United States] Columbian University (http)</b> is the\r\n      random one chosen by the download page this time; yours may differ.\r\n    <p>\r\n    This file should start downloading in your standard download folder.\r\n    This file is about 200 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you\r\n      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 5 minutes over a\r\n      cable modem).\r\n    Don't worry about the exact time as long as the download continues to make\r\n      steady progress.\r\n    In Chrome progress is shown on the bottom-left of the window, via the icon\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/downloadprogress.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    The file should appear as\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/downloadfile.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Terminate the window browsing the Eclipse download.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Eclipse\r\n      (and reinstall it later, if necessary).\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Start the <b>Installing</b> instructions directly below.\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Installing Eclipse</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Unzip <b>eclipse-cpp-luna-R-win32.zip from:</b>, the file that you just\r\n     downloaded and moved.\r\n    <br>\r\n    On my machine (running Windows 7), I can\r\n    <ul>\r\n    <li>Right-click the file.\r\n    <li>Hover over the <b>IZArc</b> command from the menu of options.\r\n    <li>Click <b>Extract Here</b>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/izarc.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    If you do not have IZArc or an equivalent unzipping program, here is the\r\n      web site to download a free copy of\r\n      <a href=\"http://izarc.org/download.html\" target=\"_blank\">IZarc</a>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Unzipping this file creates a folder named <b>eclipse</b; unzipping\r\n      200 MB can take a few minutes.\r\n    You can leave this folder here or move it elsewhere on your hard disk.\r\n    I recommend putting the downloaded file and resulting folder in the\r\n       <b>C:\\Program Files\\</b> directory.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Create a shortcut on your desktop to the <b>eclipse.exe</b> file in\r\n      this <b>eclipse</b> folder: <img src=\"images/eclipseexe.jpg\">\r\n    <br>\r\n    On most Windows machines, you can\r\n    <ul>\r\n    <li>Right-press the file <b>eclipse.exe</b>\r\n    <li>Drag it to the desktop.\r\n    <li>Release the right button.\r\n    <li>Click <b>Create shortcut here</b>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Now you are ready to perform a <b>one-time only</b> setup of Eclipse on\r\n      your machine.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Double-click the shortcut to Eclipse that you just created above.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following splash screen will appear\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/splash.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    and then a <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window will appear.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/workspacelauncher.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the <b>Workspace</b> text box, your login name should appear between\r\n      <b>C:\\Users\\</b> and <b>\\workspace</b>, instead of <b>Administrator</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Leave <b>unchecked</b> the \r\n      <b>Use this as the default and do not ask again</b> box.\r\n    Although you will use this same workspace for the entire quarter (checking\r\n      projects in and out of it), it is best to see this\r\n      <b>Workspace Launcher</b> pop-up window each time you start Eclipse, to\r\n      remind you where your workspace is located.\r\n\r\n<li>Click <b>OK</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Progress bars will appear at the bottom of the spash screen as Eclipse\r\n      loads.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Eventually the Eclipse workbench will appear with a <b>Welcome</b> tab\r\n      covering it.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/welcome.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Terminate (click <b>X</b> on) the <b>Welcome</b> tab.\r\n    <p>\r\n    You will not see the <b>Welcome</b> tab when you start Eclipse after this\r\n      first time.\r\n    You should now see the following Eclipse workbench.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/postwelcome.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Notice the <b>C/C++</b> words/icon appear on the top left (in the Window\r\n      title-bar) and below the upper right-hand corner (beneath the tool-bar).\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>To simplify the edit/build-recompile/run loop that we will discuss below,\r\n      perform the following operation: after completing it, clicking\r\n      <b>Build</b> or <b>Run</b> will automatically save the contents of any\r\n      edited file before the program is rebuilt and run.\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li>Select <b>Window</b> | <b>Preferences</b>.\r\n      <li>In the <b>Preferences</b> popup window disclose <b>General</b> and\r\n           select <b>Workspace</b>.\r\n      <li>Click \"Save automatically before build\" checkbox, as follows..\r\n      <p>\r\n      <img src=\"images/preferences2.jpg\">\r\n      <p>\r\n      <li>Click <b>Apply</b>.\r\n      <p>\r\n      <li>In the <b>Preferences</b> popup window disclose <b>Run/Debug</b> and\r\n           select <b>Launching</b>.\r\n      <li>In the \"Save required dirty editors before launching\" section click\r\n           the <b>Always</b> radio button as follows.\r\n      <p>\r\n      <img src=\"images/preferences.jpg\">\r\n      <p>\r\n      <li>Click <b>Apply</b>.\r\n      <li>Click <b>OK</b>.\r\n    </ul>\r\n    Once you have set up these preference in a workspace on your home machine,\r\n      you will never have to peform this step again.\r\n</ol>\r\nEclipse is now installed for C++.\r\nStart the <b>Testing</b> instructions directly below.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<h3>Testing Eclipse, C++, and Libraries</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Download the <a href=\"ics46-templates.zip\">ics46-templates.zip</a> file\r\n       and unzip it.\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Select <b>File</b> | <b>Imports</b> as shown below.\r\n      <p>\r\n      <img src=\"images/import.jpg\">\r\n      <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Disclose <b>General</b> and select <b>Existing Projects into Workspace</b>\r\nas shown below.\r\n      <p>\r\n      <img src=\"images/existingprojects.jpg\">\r\n      <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Click <b>Next&gt;</b><br>\r\nBrowse to the <b>ics46-templates</b> folder you downloaded and unzipped in\r\nabove.<br>\r\nClick the \"Copy projects into workspace\" checkbox, as shown below.\r\n      <p>\r\n      <img src=\"images/copyboth.jpg\">\r\n      <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Click <b>Finish</b>.\r\nThe <b>Project Explorer</b> window should be updated to appear as shown below.\r\n      <p>\r\n      <img src=\"images/newexplorer.jpg\">\r\n      <p>\r\n      You can explore the <b>courselib</b> and <b>googletestlib</b> projects\r\n        by disclosing/eliding their folders and subfolders.\r\n      The software in these projects have already been built, so you do\r\n        <b>not</b> need to build them here.\r\n      <p>\r\n      The <b>project</b> folder should remain unchanged.\r\n      Below (and in the future) you will copy/paste this <b>project</b> folder\r\n        to create a new project folder in which to put your source files for the\r\n        new project.\r\n \r\n<!--- Not needed: supplying .a files\r\n<li>Either click the <b>courselib</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab\r\nand then click the <b>Hammer</b> icon <img src=\"images/hammer.jpg\">; or\r\nright-click the <b>courselib</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab\r\nand select <b>Build Project</b>.\r\n    The Console window should show the following.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/buildresultslibrary.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>If you disclose the main icons under the <b>courselib</b> icon in the\r\n       <b>Project Explorer</b> tab you will see the following.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/disclosures2.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    The <b>src</b> folder shows the <b>.hpp/.ccp</b> files in the library.\r\n    If you disclose the <b>Debug/src</b> folder, it shows the <b>.o</b>\r\n      files compiled from the library files that are not templated.\r\n    Projects refer to the <b>courselib</b> folder, to find the templated\r\n       <b>.hpp</b> files in the top <b>src</b> folder, and the\r\n       <b>libcourselib.a</b> file in the <b>Debug</b> folder.\r\n    Later in the quarter you will be asked to study the code in the\r\n      <b>.hpp/.cpp</b> files here for your programming assignments.\r\n    If/when you are done looking now, elide all these icons leaving just the\r\n      <b>courselib</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab.\r\n<p>\r\n--->\r\n\r\n<li>Right-click the <b>project</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab\r\n  and select <b>Copy</b> as shown below (or click  <b>project</b> icon and use\r\n

Editor tab for the <b>driver.cpp</b> file select all the lines (Ctrl+a)\r\n  and then uncomment them (Ctrl+/).\r\n<p>\r\n    The Editor tab for the <b>driver.cpp</b> file should show the following.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/testseteditortab.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Notice the <b>*</b> prefixing the <b>driver.cpp</b> file name: this\r\n      indicates the file has been modified but not saved.\r\n    You can right-click in the file and select <b>Save</b>, but Eclipse will do\r\n      that automatically when you build a project (if you correctly followed the\r\n      instructions for installing it).\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>Either click the <b>test_set</b> icon in the <b>Project Explorer</b> tab\r\nand then click the <b>Hammer</b> icon <img src=\"images/hammer.jpg\">;

icon (<img src=\"images/runicon.gif\">).\r\nKnowing this shortcut is useful.\r\n<p>\r\nIgnore the two warning message: this code uses a for-loop counter\r\n  that is not used inside the loop.\r\nWhen prompted, type <b>1000</b> and enter, enter, and <b>1000</b> and enter\r\n  (as shown in green below).\r\n<p>\r\nThe Console window should show the following.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img

quiz/program,\r\n<li>Download and unzip the folder for the quiz/program,\r\n<li>Copy all the files in its <b>src</b> folder (all the <b>.hpp</b> and\r\n      <b>.cpp</b> files) into the empty <b>src</b> folder of  the new project\r\n      folder;\r\n      copy all <b>.txt</b> files into the top-level of the new project folder,\r\n<li>Compile-Build the project; often doing so requires uncommenting exactly one\r\n      of the  <b>.cpp</b> files in the <b>src</b> folder.\r\n<li>Run the compiled-built code.\r\n</ul>\r\nAll these steps were shown above.\r\nYou should never have to reimport the <b>courselib</b> or\r\n  <b> googletestlib</b>, although I might instruct you to\r\n  change some the the files in the <b>courselib/src</b> folder\r\n  and rebuild the library:\r\n  Read
