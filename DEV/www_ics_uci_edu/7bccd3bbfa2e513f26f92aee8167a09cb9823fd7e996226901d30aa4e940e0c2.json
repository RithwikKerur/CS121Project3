That was \r\nmy father's hebrew name, English Paul Langsam.  When we moved a cousin of \r\nours gave me an entire digest of Langsam's we have not unpacked this as we \r\nare in temp housing till our knew house is built.  You might have interest \r\nin that.  If you wish more info about our family my grandfather his \r\nchildren etc. please advise.  Only my cousins are alive none of the direct \r\ndescendants of my grandfather Nathan are.  I believe I was named for my \r\nfathers grandfather one Ephraim the other Fimeth which one was a Langsam \r\ncould be in the volume of family tree I alluded to.\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n    -----Original Message-----\r\n    From: moishe@langsam.com &lt;moishe@langsam.com&gt;\r\n    To: phyllis@ivesearch.com &lt;phyllis@ivesearch.com&gt;\r\n    Date: Monday, February 08, 1999 4:25 PM\r\n    Subject: Re: pesach langsam\r\n\r\n\r\n    I would be very interested in any detail you could provide. Is the digest\r\n    you speak of a white soft-covered book with the title Langsam~Spira Family?\r\n    Have you had a chance to check out my website at:\r\n    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/hometree.htm\r\n    I would be interested in anything you could tell me.\r\n    Thanks!\r\n    -Moishe\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom:  phyllis@ivesearch.com\r\nSubject:  Re: pesach langsam\r\nPostedDate:  02/09/99 08:41:18 AM\r\nSendTo:  CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential\r\nDeliveredDate:  02/09/99 08:45:47 AM\r\n\r\nI believe the book had a blue cover and am not sure what the names were on \r\nthe outside.  Unfortunately we are not moving until June and have no idea \r\nwhat box the book is in.  I will however check with my sister and one of \r\nmy cousins to see if they might have a copy.\r\nMy father was one of 5. One sister died at 11 the others were all older \r\nIrving,Lillian and Martha.  Lillian was never married and Martha was \r\nmarried late in life no children. Only Irving with wife Bessie who I never \r\nknew as they were divorced had two sons Ralph and Herbert Langsam.  Ralph \r\nwith his wife lives in Palm Beach Gardens and he has twin daughters Carol \r\nand Diane.  Herbert like my father was a pharmacist.  Extremely successful \r\nwith nursing homes lives in Okla.City has one daughter who I never met.\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nFrom:  jives@concentric.net\r\nSubject:  Re: Family Tree of the Jewish People: Phyllis LANGSAM\r\nPostedDate:  03/22/99 10:05:23 PM\r\nSendTo:  CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential\r\nReplyTo:  jives@concentric.net\r\nDeliveredDate:  03/22/99 10:06:38 PM\r\n\r\nMoishe Miller wrote:\r\n>\r\n-----------------------------\r\nMoishe:\r\n\r\nI passed your message on to my sister-in-law Phyllis who lives in Ohio.\r\nShe is not involved in genealogy.\r\n\r\nJoel Ives\r\n\r\n__________________________________________\r\n-----Original Message-----\r\nFrom: moishe@langsam.com &lt;moishe@langsam.com&gt;\r\nTo: phyllis@ivesearch.com &lt;phyllis@ivesearch.com&gt;\r\nDate: Sunday, March 21, 1999 10:02 AM\r\nSubject: Langsam\r\n\r\n\r\n>Hi,\r\n>In the interim, while you wait to move and unpack, do you think I might be\r\n>able to contact a few people?
