I hope you enjoy this course and learn alot! If you have any problems please feel free to come and talk to me. If my office hours are not convenient to meet then send me an email to schedule a time that you are available. Always remember to check this page for important announcements. \n</UL>\n\n<H3>Announcement 2: 1/8/01</H3>\n\n\n<UL>\n<LI>Class Room has been changed from CS 432 to IERF B011\n<LI>Class Hours: 12noon - 2:50pm\n<LI>No dropping after week 3 (4th week of quarter)\n</LI>\n</UL>\n\n<H3>Announcement 3: 1/30/01</H3>\n\n\n<UL>\nI will be holding a discussion session every wednesday from 2 - 2:50 in Rm CS 180. I hope most of you can make it. It is nearly impossible to find a room at any other time on campus that is at a reasonable hour. The other choices are at 8am or after 6pm, both of which are not good for me. Unfortunately I already have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow so our first discussion session will start next week:  Wednesday, Feb 7th.\n</UL>\n<H3>Announcement 4: 2/5/01</H3>\n\n<UL>\nI am moving the Tuesday office hour from 10am-11am to 1pm-2pm.\nThe discussion session will be held in SSPA 1165, not in CS 180.\n</UL>\n<H3>Announcement 5: 2/7/01</H3>\n\n<UL>\nDue to the small size of our regular classroom I have asked that they allocate a larger class for the midterm and the final. \n\nThe midterm and the final will be given in the following room:\n\nSSL 248 (SSL = Social Science Lab)\n\nThe exam will start at 12 noon and it will be 1.5hrs long. \nAll material covered thru this past monday will be included in the exam. You do not need to know acronyms, you may bring one double sided sheet of notes. \n\n</UL>\n<BR>\n</UL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
