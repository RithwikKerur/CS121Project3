By making 3D immersive\nenvironments well integrated with everyday computing activities, it\nbecomes possible to develop engaging new applications for Science,\nEducation and Health that can reach the widest audiences possible.</span><br style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">The large-scale virtual environments\nof tomorrow have to be sufficiently flexible (to support varied\nenvironments), powerful (to not limit functionality to the least common\ndenominator), and extensible (to support decades of continued\nevolution, much as the Internet and Web have). MMVEs will have a\ntremendous impact on the way the Internet will evolve in the future due\nto their interactive and real-time nature. Online computer\ngaming/simulation is forecasted to become one of the most demanding\napplications on the Internet. Researchers in the networking arena need\nto be prepared to meet that challenge, and our success will depend very\nmuch on how well we understand the requirements of this new class of\napplications.</span><br style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">With the anticipated growth in this\napplication area, we will be seeing more and more stress being placed\non the underlying transport infrastructure to provide the kind of\nquality of experience (QoE) that these applications and their users\nexpect. The quality of an end user&#8217;s experience is the true litmus test\nof a proper online game deployment. Only by understanding both the\napplication needs and the underlying network facilities can one design\nnetworking mechanisms and develop pre and post processing schemes to\nensure the required QoE. The next section gives an overview of some\nrecent work that I have conducted and plan to continue pursuing in QoE.</span><br style=\"font-weight: normal;\">\n<br>\n</div>\n<big><big>\n\n</big></big></div>\n</body></html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
