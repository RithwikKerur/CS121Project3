The switch system must determine which inputs will transmit to\nwhich outputs in a given time slot.  Mathematically, the\nswitching component of a router reduces to solving a bipartite\nmatching problem.  The router must match as many input links as\npossible.  However, there is tradeoff between fairness and\nthroughput.  In this talk, I will give a brief overview of\nswitch scheduling problem and some algorithms that are being used.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
