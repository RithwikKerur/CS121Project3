keep it on your machine,\r\n  in case you need to re-install Python.\r\nWhen installed, Python requires about an additional 90 Mb of disk space.\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Downloading</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Click\r\n    <a href=\"https://www.python.org/downloads/\" target = \"_blank\">\r\n      Python Download</a>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following page will appear in your browser.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/python/pythondownloadpage.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Click the <b>Windows</b> link (two lines below the\r\n       <b>Download Python 3.7.4</b> button).\r\n    The following page will appear in your browser.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/python/pythondownloadwindowspage.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Click on the\r\n     <b>Download <u> Windows x86-64 executable installer</u></b> link\r\n     under the top-left <b>Stable Releases</b>.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following pop-up window titled <b>Opening python-3.74-amd64.exe</b>\r\n      will appear.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/java/savefile.jpg\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Click the <b>Save File</b> button.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <p>\r\n    The file named <b>python-3.7.4-amd64.exe</b> should start downloading into\r\n      your standard download folder.\r\n    This file is about 30 Mb so it might take a while to download fully if you\r\n      are on a slow internet connection (it took me about 10 seconds over a\r\n      cable modem).\r\n    <p>\r\n    The file should appear as\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/python/exefile.jpg\">\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Move this file to a more permanent location, so that you can install Python\r\n      (and reinstall it easily later, if necessary).\r\n<p>\r\n<li>Feel free to explore this webpage further;
