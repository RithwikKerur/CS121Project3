While numerous progress were made on\nthe problem  since Jozsef Beck's breakthrough result in 1991 (which\nsolved it for a relaxation of the lemma), a constructive proof for the\ngeneral Lov&aacute;sz Local Lemma was only discovered recently (2009) by\nMoser and Tardos.  We present Moser's very simple algorithm and the\nbeautiful proof of its correctness.\n</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4812\">a paper</a> by\nRobin A.
