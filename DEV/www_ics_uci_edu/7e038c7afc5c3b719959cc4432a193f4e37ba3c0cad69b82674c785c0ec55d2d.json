Young and  Richard N. Taylor in\nTechnical Report TR-94-??, Department of Information and Computer Science,\nUniversity of California, Irvine, CA 92171-3425, 1994.\n\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nThis paper focuses on two important requirements which must be\nsatisfied before widespread use of process programming in industrial\nsettings becomes a reality. First, a process programming language must\nbe customizable, allowing the user to fit the language into the\nexisting environment, rather than requiring the user to change\nexisting work environments, work procedures, or corporate culture to\nmeet the language's worldview. Second, the process programming\nlanguage should be accessible to all project personnel, both technical\nand non-technical. This paper presents the Teamware category object\nmodel, a new object model which has been developed to help meet these\nkey requirements. This object model supports development of customized\nactivity types, resource types, and artifact types to support the\nneeds of a particular corporation or project. These new types are\npresented to non-technical end users as part of a \"pre-existing\"\nlanguage. The paper shows how the model differs from traditional class\nsystems. It also compares the customization support provided in\nTeamware with that of other existing process systems and shows how\nTeamware's category model allows definition of a higher level of\nabstraction.\n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Jan 30 14:51:08 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
