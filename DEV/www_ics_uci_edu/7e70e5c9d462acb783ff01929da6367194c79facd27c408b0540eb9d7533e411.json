The earliest\nillustrations of this maze that can be securely dated are a pair of\nfigures on a clay pot from Tell Rifa'at, Syria (dated before 1200BC) and\na doodle scratched on the back of a clay accounting tablet in King\nNestor's palace in Pylos (Western Greece) and hardened by fire when the\npalace burned down around 1200BC). ... The game of drawing this nucleus\nand completing it to a maze is still played today. ...\n<P>\nOnce the mazes are unrolled, it bicomes obvious that they are intimately\nrelated to, and perhaps derived from, the meander patterns ubiquitous in\nprimitive decoration.  It should be noted that meanders and mazes appear\ninterchangeably on the earliest coins from Knossos ... suggesting\nstrongly that [these forms] were equivalent symbols for the Labyrinth.\n<P>\n... every Roman mosaic maze that has survived\nintact is a meander maze, and I will make the case that the mazes that\ndo not appear to be of this type fail to do so because of faulty\nrestoration or recording.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P><HR><P>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/labtile/\">Labyrinth\ntiling</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<BR>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"phillips.html\" --></SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
