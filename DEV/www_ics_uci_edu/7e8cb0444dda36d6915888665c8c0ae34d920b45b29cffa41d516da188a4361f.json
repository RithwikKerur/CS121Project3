First of all, there may be relevant differences between traditional word-processing documents and Web pages, just in the type of document they are. I\u2019m not sure about this point, but I thought I\u2019d throw it out for consideration. I can think of plenty of differences between the types of documents that users save in Word format vs. HTML, but I\u2019m not sure that these differences are relevant for this purpose.</P>\n\n<P></P>\n\n<P>The next issue is very real, and that\u2019s the network. There are things we can get away with on a LAN, both with respect to speed and security, that we can\u2019t get away with on the Internet. This might change how we do a lot of things.</P>\n\n<P> </P> \n <!-- <H2>Feature list to support</H2>\n\n</P>\n\n<P><UL><LI>How do collaborative authoring features differ w/r/t traditional documents vs. Web?<LI>LAN/file system vs. Internet</UL></P>\n\n<P>  --> \n</Body>\n</HTML>", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
