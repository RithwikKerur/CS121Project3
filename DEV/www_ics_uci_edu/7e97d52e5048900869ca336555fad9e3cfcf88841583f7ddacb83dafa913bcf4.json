Avis and K. Fukuda, to appear in <i>\nDiscrete Applied Math</i> as \"Reverse Search for Enumeration\") \n\n<p>The reverse search technique has been recently introduced by the\nauthors for efficient enumeration of vertices of polyhedra and\narrangements. In this paper, the authors develop the idea in a\nbroader framework and show its applications to various problems in\noperations research, combinatorics, and geometry.</p>\n\n<p>In my talk, I will be discussing the motivations and details of\nreverse search, followed by a discussion of how it can be applied\nto the problem of generating all possible triangulations to a set\nof <i>n</i> points in the plane.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
