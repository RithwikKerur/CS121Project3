These proofs do not require Euler's formula so there is\nno danger of circular reasoning.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nFirst draw the planar graph corresponding to the polygon, with straight\nline segment edges.  It is possible to choose a sufficiently small\nradius r, such that if we move each vertex somewhere within a circle of\nthat radius centered on its original location, the resulting graph will\nremain planar; scale the graph so that r=1.\nThen move every vertex to the nearest integer vertex; the result is an\nequivalent planar graph drawn in the grid.\n<P>\nThe outer face of the graph is covered exactly once by the remaining faces,\nso the sum of the areas of the remaining faces should equal the area of\nthe outer faces.  This sum of areas is, by Pick's Theorem,\nI+X+B/2+S/2-(F-1), where I is the number of points interior to one of the faces,\nX is the number of points on an interior edge (each of which counts 1/2\nin each of two faces), S is the sum (over all vertices) of the number of\ninterior faces the vertex belongs to, and the (F-1) term comes from\nadding the -1 term in each of F-1 applications of Pick's theorem.\n<P>\nA vertex interior to the graph contributes a term to S equal to its degree,\nwhereas a vertex on the outer face contributes only its degree minus one.\nTherefore S=2E-K where K is the number of vertices on the outer face.\nFurther, by Pick's Theorem, the area of the outer face is\n(I+X+V-K)+(B+K)/2-1.\nCombining the two equations S=2E-K and\nI+X+B/2+S/2-(F-1)=(I+X+V-K)+(B+K)/2-1 yields the result.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P>Unfortunately <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/pick3d.html\">Pick's theorem\ndoes not generalize</a> to higher dimensions, so this approach seems\nunlikely to work for proving higher-dimensional forms of Euler's formula.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
