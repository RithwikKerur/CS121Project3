The goal is to do this in o(n) space, where n is the total\nnumber of identities. The straggler identification problem has\napplications, for example, in determining the set of unacknowledged\npackets in a high-bandwidth multicast data stream. We show that there\nis a simple randomized solution using O(d log n log(1/epsilon)) bits\nthat can maintain a multiset and solve the straggler identification\nproblem, tolerating false deletions, where epsilon>0 is a\nuser-defined parameter bounding the probability of an incorrect\nresponse. This randomized solution is based on a new type of Bloom\nfilter, which we call the invertible Bloom filter. \n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
