You will make arguments either for or against the case study position, according to <a href=\"../slides/groups.html\">what you position you were assigned</a>. </p>\r\n        <p>Create your strongest arguments: Decide as a group what your strongest arguments are, and how to convince those in power. (Item #6 on law slide 12.) Make sure to bring in course concepts from both economics and networking to support your position. This is critical and example concepts will be listed on each case study page. Make sure you get your facts correct. </p>\r\n        <p>Create your presentation: Decide as a group what should go into the presentation, and in what order. (Item #7 on law slide 12.) You will have 8 minutes to present, so a rough guideline is that you should have approximately 8-10 slides (not including the title slide). You will not have nearly enough time to present everything you have learned. Therefore, you should decide what you think is the most important information for your classmates. Create your slides.</p>\r\n        <p>Review and practice your presentation: Review all of the slides your group created. Revise your decision about what should go into the presentation, and in what order, to make the presentation most effective. Practice giving the presentation out loud, refine your timing, and decide how you will communicate with each presenter during the presenation to keep to the agreed upon timing.</p>\r\n        <p>Prepare for the debate: Make sure you understand what type of lobbyists are on the other side of the issue. Prepare a list of at least 4 questions that you may ask an opposing lobbyist team. Each question should take no longer than 30 seconds to ask. Although you will only argue your side of the issue, you should understand what arguments the opposing side might make. </p>\r\n        <p>Create your Final Report: Use your interim report as a starting point. Edit as you see fit, based on your work since you turned in the interim report. Add a summary of the verbal arguments you made during your presentation. The Final Report should be approximately 8-10 pages. </p>\r\n      </blockquote>\r\n      <p><strong>The day of your presentation:</strong></p>      \r\n      <ol>\r\n        <li><strong>Before the  class, upload your presentation to somewhere where you can very quickly retrieve it in class.</strong> You must use the computer in the classroom.</li>\r\n        <li>During the first 50 minutes of class, your group will present your arguments to the class. You can share the 8 minutes among your group however you desire.</li>\r\n        <li>During the last 30 minutes of class, your group will debate the topic with other lobbyist groups. Your group will be called on to ask several questions, and to answer several questions. Each question should take no longer than 30 seconds to ask. Each answer should take no longer than 60 seconds. You should rotate among members of your group in asking and answering questions. <strong>Decide how you will do this beforehand.</strong></li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n      <p><strong>The evening after your presentation:</strong></p>\r\n      <blockquote>\r\n        <p><strong>Turn in your presentation slides by 10pm</strong>.\r\n          Only one member of your group should do the following: Convert your draft slides to PDF.
