An arrangement is simple\nif no 3 pseudolines have a common point of intersection.</p>\n\n<p>S.Felsner in his paper \"On the number of arrangements of\npseudolines\" presented an enumeration of simple arrangements of 10\npseudolines. This enumeration became an addition to the previous\nenumerations of simple arrangements on up to 9 pseudolines (due to\nKnuth).</p>\n\n<p>I will also briefly talk about my work on enumeration of\narrangements of up to 12 pseudolines.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
