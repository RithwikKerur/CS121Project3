We call this variant the continuous model of the survival\nproblem. The discrete model of this problem is: Given the trajectories\n(paths) of k point robots in a graph over a (long) time interval\n0,1,2,...,T, find a trajectory (path) for another robot, that avoids\neach of the other k at any time instance in thegiven time interval. We\nintroduce the notions of survival number of a region,and that of a\ngraph, respectively, as the maximum number of trajectories which can\nbe avoided in the region (resp. graph). We give the first estimates on\nthe survival number of the n x n grid Gn, and also devise an efficient\nalgorithm for the corresponding safe path planning problem in\narbitrary graphs. We then show that our estimates on the survival\nnumber of Gn on the number of paths that can be avoided in Gn can be\nextended for the survival number of a bounded (square) region. In the\nfinal part of our paper, we consider other related offline questions,\nsuch as the maximum number of men problem and the spy problem.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
