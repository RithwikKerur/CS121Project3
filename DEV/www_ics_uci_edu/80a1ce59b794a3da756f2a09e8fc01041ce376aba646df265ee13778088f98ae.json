Eppstein.<br>\n<a href=\"//arXiv.org/abs/math.CO/9907126\">arXiv:math.CO/9907126</a>.<br>\n<i>Algorithmica</i> 27: 275&ndash;291, 2000\n(special issue on treewidth, graph minors, and algorithms).\n<p>\nThis paper introduces the <i>diameter-treewidth\nproperty</i> (later known as <i>bounded local treewidth</i>): a\nfunctional relationship between the diameter of its graph and its treewidth.\nPreviously known results imply that planar graphs have\nbounded local treewidth; we characterize the\nother minor-closed families with this property. Specifically,\nminor-closed family F has bounded local treewidth if and only if there\nexists an <i>apex graph</i> G that is not in F; an apex graph is a graph\nthat can be made planar by removing a single vertex.\nThe minor-free families that exclude an apex graph (and therefore have\nbounded local treewidth) include the bounded-genus\ngraphs (for which, as with planar graphs, we show a linear bound for the\ntreewidth as a function of the diameter) and K<sub>3,a</sub>-free graphs.  As\na consequence, subgraph isomorphism for subgraphs of bounded size and\napproximations to several NP-hard optimization problems can be computed\nefficiently on these graphs, extending previous results for planar\ngraphs.\n<p>Some of these results\nwere announced in the conference version of\n\"<a href=\"p-psgi.html\">subgraph isomorphism for planar graphs and related\nproblems</a>\" but not included in the journal version. Since its\npublication, there have been many more works on local treewidth. The class of\nproblems that could be solved quickly on graphs of bounded local\ntreewidth was extended and classified by Frick and Grohe, \"<a\nhref=\"//doi.org/10.1145/504794.504798\">Deciding first-order\nproperties of locally tree-decomposable structures</a>\", <i>J. ACM</i>\n48: 1184&ndash;1206, 2001;\nthe proof that bounded local treewidth is equivalent to having an\nexcluded apex minor was simplified, and the dependence of the treewidth\non diameter\nimproved, by a subsequent paper of Demaine and Hajiaghayi, \"<a href=\"//erikdemaine.org/papers/DiameterTreewidth_Algorithmica/\">Diameter and\ntreewidth in minor-closed graph families, revisited</a>\", <i>Algorithmica</i>\n40: 211&ndash;215, 2004. The concept of local treewidth is the basis for the\ntheory of <i>bidimensionality</i>, a general framework for\nfixed-parameter-tractable algorithms and approximation algorithms in\nminor-closed graph families; for a survey, see Demaine and Hajiaghayi,\n\"<a href=\"//erikdemaine.org/papers/BidimensionalSurvey_CJ/\">The\nbidimensionality theory and its algorithmic applications</a>\", <i>The\nComputer J.</i> 51: 292&ndash;302, 2008.\n<p>(<a href=\"/~eppstein/bibs/eppstein.html#Diameter and treewidth in minor-closed graph families\">BibTeX</a> &ndash;\n<a href=\"//fano.ics.uci.edu/cites/Document/Diameter-and-treewidth-in-minor-closed-graph-families.html\">Citations</a>)\n<p>\n</ul>\n\n<hr><p>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/pubs/\">Publications</a> &ndash;\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a> &ndash;\n<a href=\"/~theory/\">Theory Group</a> &ndash;\n<a href=\"/\">Inf. &amp; Comp.
