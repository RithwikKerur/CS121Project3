Six of the vertices of the smaller\nbox are on the faces of the larger box, 3/5 of the way along the face\ndiagonals; the remaining two vertices are 1/5 and 4/5 of the way along\nthe long diagonal of the longer box.

The method was to express the requirements\nthat certain small cube vertices be on the planes of the large cube's\nfaces in terms of a system of polynomial equations, use Mathematica to\nfind all families of solutions of these equations, and check that each\nsolution either has the form I already knew about (with the two cubes\nsharing a diagonal) or doesn't work geometrically (for instance,\nsolutions involving complex numbers).\n\nI've put my calculations online at\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/box-in-box.nb\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/box-in-box.nb</A>\nif you care to examine them (I'd be just as happy if you didn't;\nas I said, they're not pretty).\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           Greg Huber &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:huber@physics.arizona.edu\">huber@physics.arizona.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: box in box problem\n<B>Date:</B>           Mon, 18 Jan 1999 23:22:06 -0700 (MST)\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n\tDate: Mon, 18 Jan 1999 20:58:07 -0800 (PST)\n\tFrom: David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;\n\tTo: Greg Huber &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:huber@physics.arizona.edu\">huber@physics.arizona.edu</A>&gt;\n\tSubject: Re: box in box problem\n\n\tGreg Huber writes:\n\n\t &gt; 2) Will your methods work for the d=4 case: \n\t &gt; \n\t &gt;         Find the smallest 4-cube that touches** all 8 cubical faces of\n\t &gt;         a unit 4-cube.

But the 4d case is perhaps more symmetric since you\nhave 8 cubical faces and 16 vertices, and for a 4d cube there is a very\nclear meaning to \"every other\" vertex.

You can also get a 16-cell by taking the\ncenter point of every face of the cube.\n\nSo probably the correct answer is to inscribe the small cube so that\nevery other vertex is at the center of a face of the large cube.\n\n(This is still guesswork, I haven't even verified that the other faces\nof the small cube stay inside the large cube.)\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information & Computer Science\neppstein@ics.uci.edu http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             Greg Huber &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:huber@physics.arizona.edu\">huber@physics.arizona.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: box in box problem\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 20 Jan 1999 09:03:02 -0800 (PST)\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nPS would you mind if I added your comments to my page\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/box-in-box.html?\n\nAlso, I don't think I left a pointer from there to\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/qtvr/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/qtvr/</A>\nbut you might want to check that out -- I have a nice animated gif\n(and quicktime vr model) of the box-in-a-box configuration.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information & Computer Science\neppstein@ics.uci.edu http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/box-in-box.html?\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/box-in-box.html?</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             Greg Huber &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:huber@physics.arizona.edu\">huber@physics.arizona.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: box in box problem\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 20 Jan 1999 09:07:42 -0800 (PST)\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nPPS it is very easy to see that putting every other vertex of the small\ncube at the face centers of the large cube works, and that it is optimal.\n\nSince each opposite pair of vertices of the small cube form a diameter\nof the small cube, perpendicular to the large cube's faces, there is no\nway to get a pair of vertices touching parallel planes farther apart\nthan the large cube's faces, and for similar reasons the other 8\nvertices of the small cube can't touch or be outside the large cube.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information & Computer Science\neppstein@ics.uci.edu http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:huber@physics.arizona.edu\">huber@physics.arizona.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        explicit coordinates\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 20 Jan 1999 10:26:52 -0800 (PST)\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nLet the large box's coordinates be (+-1, +-1, +-1, +-1).\nThen the eight small box vertices that touch the large box's faces\nhave coordinates that are permutations of (0, 0, 0, +-1).\nTo get the other eight vertices, take every other corner of\nthe hypercube (+-1/2, +-1/2, +-1/2, +-1/2) (a shrunken copy of the\nlarge cube). The small cube has half the side length of the large one.\n\nActually there are two different ways of inscribing the small cube in\nthe large one, depending on which set of every other vertex of the\nshrunken cube you take.  These two small inscribed cubes, together with\nthe cube (+-1/2, +-1/2, +-1/2, +-1/2) itself, form a very nice complex\nof three cubes in which each pair of two cubes shares the eight vertices\nof a 16-cell.
