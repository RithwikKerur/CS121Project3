For example cameras sony, cameras jvc, etc\ninstead of Sony camera, etc.\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> A keyword is a handle to an object, not to a URL.\nOne of the pieces of information associated with an object can be a set\nof keywords that describes a category. Different property for the object.&nbsp;\nDiscover the right keyword other than the name.&nbsp; Names aren't global.\nIn RealNames, the name plus the locale makes the name unique. For example,\na lookup on BMW for the German locale will go to .de, and will go to .com\nfor the US locale.\n<p><b>Q:</b> All keywords you've used are trademarks, and trademarks aren't\nunique globally, only within a country and industry..\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> Trademarks are unique within locale.&nbsp; So, what\nis the user's exepectation?&nbsp; McDonalds should go to the food company,\neven if there's McDonalds shoe store in Alabama.&nbsp; Other is advertisement.&nbsp;\nIf you type something and it goes nowhere, the lookup has failed.&nbsp;\nFor example, drugs.com was for sale (for 2M).&nbsp; We incorporate user\nexepectations.&nbsp; If a company markets under a name like jobs.com, and\nthey create a user expectation around that name, we can measure this, and\nset the lookup appropriately.&nbsp; Second part of question. Commerical.&nbsp;\nPeople refer to things.&nbsp; It's about people to things, and people to\npeople.&nbsp; Keywords are user friendly.&nbsp; Context of the web goes\nto my homepage.&nbsp; Email address we can use the same thing, resources,\netc.\n<p><b>Q:</b> Are names only fee for service?\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> No, very few names are currently paid for. RealNames\ngoes to existing name holders and tells them about the statistics service\nand persistence, where the name is more persistent than address.&nbsp;\nAlso have a service for re-mapping a keyword to a new URL. For sony this\nlink management is very powerful for them, allowing them to fix broken\nlinks.\n<p><b>Henrik Rood:</b> Trademark law doesn't protect this.\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> Judgement is very difficult.&nbsp; We started doing\nit using our policy advisory board to help us make guidelines.&nbsp; There\nought to be a business entity that acts like a \"church\" to makes the decision.&nbsp;\nWe have the right to change our mind; if the user name expectation changes,\nwe will change it. Eventually there will be an external policy setting\nbody to separate business from policy-setting.\n<p><b>Bob Morgan:</b> I'm wondering how the locale information works.&nbsp;\nI just typed in Stanford and got back stanford.fr, and not stanford.edu.\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b>&nbsp; Your browser must not have set the right locale.\n<p><b>Bob Morgan:</b>&nbsp; I typed it directly into your web page.\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> Then it should have gone to Stanford University.&nbsp;\nSometimes there is negotiation with the nameholder to explain why their\nname isn't active in all contexts.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> Does Stanford University have to pay to get its\nkeyword?\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> No.&nbsp; It's all about the user expectation.\n<p>Locale stanford edu or clothing?&nbsp; University?&nbsp; How do you\ndistinguish locale?&nbsp; What should have happened, if the locale is not\nspecified, it will assume us english. Stanford should go to edu. We push\nwriting table at realtime.&nbsp; Negotiations between sameholders can take\nmuch time.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare: </b>Ah, it's in RealName's interest to seed its database.\n<p><b>Esther Dyson:</b> It would be useful for people who want to write\ntheir representative to just type in their name.\n<p><b>Q:</b> If you have a name to a server and the service name is embedded\nin the URL then you don't get persistence.\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> There are no guarantees.&nbsp; You can embed names\nto the doucment.&nbsp; You can specify the writing service of that url.&nbsp;\nIt\n<br>will be useful to urls to use common name than address.&nbsp; There's\nno guarantee in the service or one that can be context standardized.&nbsp;\nI pick a service to a particular service.&nbsp; No value because of persistence.&nbsp;\nThat persistence can go away.\n<p><b>Carl Hewitt:</b> Can a company buy a name out under someone?\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> Yes, if they meet the requirements, it can.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b>&nbsp; What would happen if a hotel situated right\noutside the entrance to Grand Canyon Nat'l Park requested a keyword?\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b>&nbsp; They would not be able to get it.\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> But, if there were, for example, two equal Grand\nCanyon tourist associations, which of the two will win?\n<p><b>Nico Popp:</b> It depends on who's better -- What is on the object.&nbsp;\nIs it more than a URL? Yes, there is also context which can be used to\nrefine keyword lookup.\n<p><b>Marshal Moseley: </b>Keywords start merging with links.&nbsp; Keyword\nmanagement, links, have you addressed this at all when they gained popularity.&nbsp;\nHow powerful is the discovery system.&nbsp; It's about adding context.&nbsp;\nDrill down the serach.&nbsp; At least you can get to the keyword. The fact\nyou can discover it easier.&nbsp; Minimum expression of the ui textfield,\ntype in text, it's easy. One you can't get the links, it will degradeback\nto urls, etc. Once you can't get text in there, when cognitive mappings\ndon't work any more, keywords start merging with the traditional web navigation\nproblem.\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> There are newspapers. Mercury news has as service.&nbsp;\nNational edition adds more.&nbsp; Larger scope needs more information.&nbsp;\nInternational scope will add more.&nbsp; What do you need to say beyond\nthe Grand Canyon?&nbsp; There is a set of well known names. A newspaper\ncan print an article about Bill Clinton without explaining who that is.\nIt is possible to build a service that can exploit this set of names. Editorial\nstaffs make the decision over which keywords need explanation, and which\ndo not.&nbsp; What are the noun phraess, and do those have internet resources?\n<p><b>Marshall Moseley:</b> There are people at the edges (of a context)\nfor which this doesn't work.\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> There are newspaper editorial staffs that decide\nthis for news. A global keyword name service will also need an editorial\nstaff for its keyword mappings.\n<p><b>Marshall Moseley:</b> This is fine at the service level.&nbsp; But\nat the user level, a user may have difficulty formulating the right keyword,\nor remembering a previously used keyword.\n<p>Don't see how that at the user level, they know what they were keywords.\nIf they don't have it as a link.&nbsp; Keywords stop becoming keywords.\n<p>Search engines.&nbsp; Won't fix all the problems.&nbsp; Maybe the answer\nwill be through search.\n<br>&nbsp;\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
