While the use\nof trusted servers allows for a relatively straightforward solution,\nthere is a large downside to this approach &mdash; both the servers and\ntheir storage must be trusted and remain uncompromised. A natural\nsolution to this problem is to encrypt stored data. However, traditional\npublic-key encryption methods require that data be encrypted to one\nparticular user's public key and are unsuitable for expressing more\ncomplex access control policies.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk, I will present recent work on a new cryptographic\nprimitive, called Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), that was created to\naddress this issue. Attribute-Based Encryption allows for expressive\naccess policies over encrypted data. In an ABE system encrypted data is\nannotated with descriptive attributes and users' private keys are\nascribed access formulas over these attributes. For example, if Carol is\nassigned to read and process systems-seminar messages during the year\n2007, she would be ascribed the private key with the access\nformula<pre>\"Subj:Systems-Seminar\" AND \"Year:2007\".</pre> I will focus\nthis talk on the challenges of creating ABE systems that are both secure\nand efficient.  In particular, an ABE system must be secure against an\nattacker that collects several private keys from different colluding\nusers. We also want to avoid designs that are prohibitively expensive;\nfor example, a solution should not include a separate public key/private\nfor every possible access control policy that might ever be used. In\naddition, I will talk about recent efforts in implementing\nAttribute-Based Encryption and making it available as a tool to be used\nby researchers in systems security.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
