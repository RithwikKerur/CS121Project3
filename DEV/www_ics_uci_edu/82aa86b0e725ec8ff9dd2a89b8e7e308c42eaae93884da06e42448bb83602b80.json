Many studies of the \ndoctor-patient \ncontact, for\rexample, focus on the way the patient's symptoms and medical problem are\rconstituted in the doctor-pa\ntient interaction . In his recent work, Paul\rAtkinson has broadened this approach to include, for example, discussions\rbetween specialists (1995). Here also, however, the emphasis is on the\rconstitution of a patient's medical situation through <i>talk</i>\n.<p>\r2. Many have taken similar departures before us: see e.g. Deleuze and Guattari\r(1988), Haraway (1991) and Mol (1993).<p>\r3. Hodgkin's Disease is a form of cancer of the lymphoid tissues. We start out\rwith a thought experiment since we want to convey \nthe sheer impossibility of\rclinical work <i>without</i> the record. Our fieldnotes have several instances\rwhere the record was (temporarily) not available, and then the unwillingness to\rundertake any potential consequential action is always prominent. For\n stylistic\rreasons, however, we preferred introducing Mr. Wood immediately, so as not to\rintroduce confusion by presenting other patients.<p>\r4. Although they do not focus specifically on the medical record, the following\rclassical studies provide valuabl\ne insights on the role of time in medical\rwork: Roth (1979/1963); Richman and Goldthorp (1977); Zerubavel (1979);\rAtkinson (1981); Horobin and McIntosh (1983); Frankenberg (1992).<p>\r5. For the notion of different, co-existing zones or orders of time see \ne.g.\rKavanagh (1995), Frankenberg (1992), and Zerubavel (1979).<p>\r6. This refers to the bone marrow treatment: the bone marrow cells are\rreinfused after high doses of chemotherapeutics have done their toxic yet\rhopefully curative work.<p>\r7 . In a study \nperformed in Sweden it was shown that in 1975, coders disagreed\rwith doctors' attributions of rheumatoid arthritis 38% of the time\r(Fagot-Largeault, p. 228).<p>\r8 . In <i>Rewriting the Soul</i>, Ian Hacking (1995, pp. 234-257) discusses the\rproblem of usi\nng current categories - such as child abuse - to describe past\ractions - such as Lewis Carrol's collections of pictures of children. When the\rcategory did not exist in social discourse, he argues, there is a real sense in\rwhich does not apply. Action, he \nargues, is always \"action under a\rdescription\". By this he means that whenever we describe a past action, we only\rhave access to it through a set of constructed categories (a description). Thus\rwhen I seek to describe the behavior of someone I consider a \n\"bully\", the\rlatter category only fits the action within the context of my middle class\rlatter twentieth century definition of bullying - a nineteenth century English\rpatriarch might have seen someone with a \"bit of backbone\" (a description not\ravailable \ntoday...). Hacking's concern is to demonstrate that where there was\rin the past no category of child abuse there was no abuse (even though, he is\rquick to point out, there might have been bad action...) (ibid, pp. 55-68).\rHowever his argument becomes much\n stronger when it is applied directly to\rsocial organization mediated by record keeping. Where there is no logging of\rthe action of child abuse in a record within an organizational discourse, there\ris no child abuse. Recording something as having been so \nmakes it so -\rparticularly when the record is itself the only trace of the past action.<p>\r9. These three dimensions are not to be taken as exhaustive or even as\rnecessarily central: they are dimensions in which the record's role is spelled\rout particular\nly clearly.<p>\r10. We wish to thank Bruno Latour for pointing out the the analytical\rsignificance of the centrality of this legal aspect of record-keeping (personal\rcommunication).<p>\r11. One could say that a specific nursing record does exist - but that \nrecord\ris hardly ever used for research, administrative and/or financial purposes.<p>\r12 . See also Goody (1977) and Latour (1987) on the power of writing and\rwritten traces.<p>\r13. As opposed to for example an ordering by means of a list of the patient's\n\rproblems, as in Weed's <i>problem oriented record </i>(1971).<p>\r14. With regards to the electronic medical record, it is tantalizing to assert\ra connection between the databases drawn upon and the work organization. There\rhave been three major epochs in\n the development of databases: the hierarchical,\rthe relational and the object-oriented (Khoshafien, 1993). All three are still\rin use today - in medical and other databases. The hierarchical database echoes\rthe hierarchical organizational structure most \nfavoured in the 1960s; the\rrelational database echoes the more team model of the 1970s; and object\rorientation is the nec plus altra of radical outsourcing. Organizational\rtheorists have certainly drawn these connections: arguing a one-to-one\rrelationship\n between database structure and organization; with mismatches\rleading to problems. Thus it has been argued that relational databases are\rsometimes problematic since `they have a flat, two dimensional view of the\rworld' (Stead et al. 1992). Although the co\nmplex mediations we describe here\rare unlikely to end up in any rigid repetition, the way a particular type of\rstory gets told, enforced and mediated through different nodes in the network\ris an important issue for further research.<p>\r15 .
