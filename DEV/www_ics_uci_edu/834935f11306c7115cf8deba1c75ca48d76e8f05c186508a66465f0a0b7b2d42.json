What about Content-Version and Derived-From? (Dan Connolly)  \n\n\tIf I read the spec right, Content-Version reflects the contents\n\tof the document.  That is, if the same document is dished up\n\ttwice it is supposed to have the same Content-Version value.\n\n\tAs I argued before (and will continue arguing until I wear people\n\tdown :-) the identity of the source is not sufficient information\n\tfor a \"checkin\", because the VC system underneath the version-aware\n\tweb server may wish to find any context associated with a prior\n\t\"checkout\".  \n\n\tNow Roy Fielding says that Content-Version is opaque and could\n\tbe used exactly for this purpose, 'cause no one would be the wiser\n\tif the Content-Version were different for each checkout of the\n\tsame document.  This is true, but now the names of these fields\n\tare losing their meaning, no?  If it's checkout context, call it\n\t\"Checkout-Context\" (or \"Checkout-Cookie\").\n\n2. Let's put the cookie in a &lt;META&gt; tag.  (Murray Maloney)\n\n\tThen we can't version things other than HTML, right?\n\n3. Appeals that this doesn't belong in a standard: \n\n   | Some systems may want to use cookies, others may want to just do a redirect \n   | with a URL extension. However my concern isn't that tokens may be needed \n   | but rather that we are over specifying. We need to be careful about not \n   | throwing in the kitchen sink. In this case there are clearly systems which \n   | may need token support but they can use the already existing cookie \n   | standards to handle this. As such there is no need to explicitly mention \n   | said support in the versioning standard. Small is beautiful when it comes \n   | to standards.\n   | \t\t\t\t\tYaron\n\n\tI totally agree with \"small is beatiful.\"  As far as I know,\n\tthere is no field which can carry the checkout context token.\n\tAs far as I can see, this is the most important token to carry.\n\tChuck everything else.\n\n4. David Durand's 3-checkout scenario.\n\n\tDead-on.\n\n\tThe intent is not to support directly all these weirdo scenarios,\n\tbut rather with a single swipe support all VC systems in their\n\tvarious context-heavy or context-light ways.\n\nChristopher\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0142.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"lock/checkout/reserve/edit\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0140.html\">David G.
