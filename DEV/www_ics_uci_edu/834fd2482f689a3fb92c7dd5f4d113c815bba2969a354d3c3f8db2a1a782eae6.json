Considerable research has been done to help the \ntesting, analysis, and verification of concurrent systems. Reachability \nanalysis is a family of analysis techniques involving exhaustive\nexamination of the whole state space. Reachability analysis is attractive \nbecause it is simple and relatively straightforward to automate, and can \nbe used in conjunction with model-checking procedures to check for \napplication-specific as well as general properties like freedom from \ndeadlocks and race conditions. However, practical application of reachability\nanalysis to real systems has been stymied by the state explosion problem, \nan exponential growth in the number of states to be explored as the \nnumber of processes increases. \n\n<P>\n\nState explosion can be substantially controlled if the analysis approach \nis ``compositional.'' An analysis technique is compositional if the \nresults of analyzing sub-systems can be ``composed'' to obtain analysis \nresults for the complete system. We propose using process algebra to achieve\nthis goal in automated analysis tools. The algebraic structure of process \nalgebra and its rich abstraction capabilities provide the means to achieve \ncompositional (divide-and-conquer) analysis. \n\n<P>\n\nThe primary contribution of this dissertation will be a demonstration \nand evaluation of the usefulness of process algebra in controlling state \nexplosion in reachability analysis of models close to the model of \nconcurrency found in real programs. We propose a two-leveled approach\nto control state explosion --- using process algebra at the coarse-grained \nlevel and simplification strategies based on a process-sleep mechanism at \nthe fine-grained level.  Although the process algebra-based compositional \napproach is not guaranteed to solve the state explosion problem, with a \nsuitably modular design that provides good service abstraction, state\nexplosion can be controlled sufficiently for application of reachability \nanalysis to be practical. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 27 13:36:13 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
