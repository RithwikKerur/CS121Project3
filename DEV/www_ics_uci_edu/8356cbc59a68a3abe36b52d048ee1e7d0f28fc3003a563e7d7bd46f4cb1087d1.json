I starting browsing through the graphic files and found a few \nthat I felt were worthy enough to download.  When I decided to display one \nof these graphics in an HTML document I found out that it was not being \nproperly displayed because I did not save the graphic file in the proper \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html#A1.6\">\ngraphic file format required for Mosaic </A> to display it. \n<P><A HREF=\"#5Questions\"><I>Return to list of questions.</I></a><P>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>Answer to Question #2</H2></A>\nMy familiarity with the Web was very low at the start of the quarter and\nso I took Professor Franklin's advice and starting to a little browsing.\nOne of my first stops was the <A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.uci.edu/\"> UCI \nGopher-based Campus Wide Information System.</A> This simple menu  has\nlinks to a load of stuff, just browsing through this gopher system\ncan take hours.  It didn't take long to make realize that the Web's \npossibilities are quite limitless.  Regardless, my initiative brought me to\na gopher menu that displays <A HREF=\"gopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/11/ro\">UCI \nRegistar's Office, </A> from here you can select <I>Enrollments</I> to get \nanother menu that has student enrollment information from up to three \nyears past. Each enrollment year is the broken up into a <I>Summary</I> \nper academic year quarter and enrollment by <I>Majors by Unit</I>.\nI could not provide a link directly to the menus so you'll have to do \na little browsing yourself, just following the directions I \nprovided through the <I>italics </I> and a go to <I>summary </I> to \nanswer the questions I provided earlier.  \n<P><A HREF=\"#5Questions\"><I>Return to list of questions.</I></a><P>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>Answer to Question #3</H2></A>\nAhhh...Sega! =)  Okay so I'm a video game junky at times and since\nvideo game junkies like to know what new games  will be coming out\nfor the systems they spend time on I found the <A HREF=\"http://www.segaoa.com/\"\n>Sega Web.</A> I would also like to say that I found out about the Sega Web \nconnection via the rec.games.video.sega Newsgroup on USENET.\n<P><A HREF=\"#5Questions\"><I>Return to list of questions.</I></a><P>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>Answer to Question #4</H2></A>\nOne day I was taking a good hard look at the <A HREF=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/\n\"> UC Irvine Office of Academic Computing </A> home page when the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/instruct/\">Seminars and Workshops</A> \nhypertext linked caught my attention.  The OAC Friday Morning Seminars are \nfree computer science related seminars that are offered to any UCI affilated \nperson, including students.  You can registar to participate though the <A HREF\n=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/instruct/Friday.html\"> Seminar Registration via Web\nform</A>, this form is also made available at the Seminar and Workshop \npage.

What I did was use the <A HREF=\"http://galaxy.einet.net/\"> EINet \nGalaxy Homepage</A> to find a topic related to my planned major.  Once \nthere I figured Microsoft is one of the richest companies in the world why not \nsee what they are up to so I selected the hypertext link to <A \nHREF=\"http://www.research.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Advanced Technology \nDivision </A>.
