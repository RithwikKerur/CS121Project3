The course grade will be\nweighted as 10% from homeworks, 40% from the midterm, and 50% from the final.\nGroup work on homeworks is\npermitted; each student should turn in his or her own copy of the\nhomeworks. Exams will be closed book, closed notes, and closed friends.\nThe course text is <i>Computational Geometry Algorithms and\nApplications</i>, 3nd ed., by de Berg, van Kreveld, Overmars, and\nCheong (Springer-Verlag, 2008). An electronic version is available\nfor no charge from UCI internet addresses at <a\nhref=\"http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-77974-2\">\nSpringerLink</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Each course meets WMF 2:00-2:50, in <a href=\"http://www.classrooms.uci.edu/GAC/ELH100.html\">ELH 100</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The final exam will be Wednesday, June 12, 10:30-12:30. \nHomeworks will be assigned on Fridays, posted on this web page, and due\nonline on the following Friday. Homeworks will be graded 50% for effort,\n50% for correctness on one of the assigned problems (chosen arbitrarily\nfrom each problem set).</p>\n    \n<h2>Tentative Schedule</h2>\n\n<dl>\n<dt>Week 1.</dt>\n<dd>Introduction and geometric primitives; 2d convex hulls\n[Chap. 1]</dd>\n<dd>Projective geometry [Sec. 8.2]</dd>\n<dd>Homework 1 (exercise numbers from the text, with some modifications as follows), due Friday, April 12:\n<ul>\n<li>CS 164: 1.1 (hint for parts b and c: the shortest path between two\npoints in the plane is a straight line), 1.3 (but your algorithm should\ntake linear time, not $O(n\\log n)$; you may assume that it is possible\nto use the points as keys in a hash table in constant time per\noperation), 8.6, 8.8.</li>\n<li>CS 266: 1.1, 1.6, 8.2, 8.6.</li></ul></dd>\n<dt>Week 2.</dt>\n<dd>Arrangements of lines and segments [Chaps. 2,8]</dd>\n<dd>Homework 2, due Friday, April 19:\n<ul>\n<li>CS 164: 2.5, 2.6, 2.12 (hint: use a plane sweep with a binary search tree whose elements are the triangles that are not surrounded by any other triangle), 8.14 (hint: it's more obvious what to do if you convert the points to their dual lines)</li>\n<li>CS 266: 2.6, 2.12, 8.4, 8.14</li></ul></dd>\n<dt>Week 3.</dt>\n<dd>Triangulation and visibility [Chaps. 3,15]</dd>\n<dd>Homework 3, due Friday, April 26:\n<ul><li>CS 164: 3.2, 3.3, 15.1, 15.7(a,b)</li>\n<li>CS 266: 3.3, 3.4, 15.4, 15.7(a,b)</li></ul></dd>\n<dt>Week 4.</dt>\n<dd>Linear programming [Chap. 4].</dd>\n<dd>No homework because of midterm</dd>\n<dd>&nbsp;</dd>\n<dt>Week 5.</dt>\n<dd>Midterm, Monday, April 29.</dd>\n<dd>Orthogonal range searching [Chaps. 5,10].</dd>\n<dd>Homework 4, due Friday, May 10:\n<ul><li>CS 164: 5.2, 5.4, 10.6(b).</li>\n<li>CS 266: 5.1, 5.4, 10.6(b).</li></ul></dd>\n<dt>Week 6.</dt>\n<dd>Quadtrees and mesh generation [Chap. 14]</dd>\n<dd>Point location, binary space partitions [Chaps 6,12]</dd>\n<dd>Homework 5, due Friday, May 17:\n<ul><li>CS 164: 6.1, 12.4, 12.11(a), 14.10(a).</li>\n<li>CS 266: 6.2, 12.4, 12.11(a), 14.10(a).</li></ul></dd>\n<dt>Week 7.</dt>\n<dd>Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay Triangulations [Chaps. 7,9]</dd>\n<dd>Homework 6, due Friday, May 24:\n<ul><li>CS 164: 7.5, 7.7, 9.2, 9.8</li>\n<li>CS 266: 71., 7.7, 9.2, 9.8</li></ul></dd>\n<dt>Week 8.</dt>\n<dd>Convex polyhedra and convex polytopes.
