An example would be <I>HTTP</I> which is commonly used by the \nWorld Wide Web.  Other kinds of protocols include Ymodem, Xmodem, Kermit, Zmodem, etc.  \nZmodem is the most common one used today because of its special ability to continue \ntransmitting a particular file after it has been interrupted (also known as \n\"crash-recovery\").  Many different kinds of protocols are being introduced in order to \nimprove the efficiency and reliability of transmitting files. \n<BR><BR>\nHere are a couple of interesting links related to protocols: <BR><BR>\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://shsibm.shh.fi/chuck/proposals.html\">Intermud Protocol Discussion</a>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html\">Basic HTTP\n\n</UL>\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What is an HTML?</H2></A>\n<B>HTML</B> stand for HyerText Markup Language.
