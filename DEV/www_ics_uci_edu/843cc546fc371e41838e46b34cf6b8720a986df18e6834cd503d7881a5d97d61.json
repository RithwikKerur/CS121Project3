In order to send and receive \nelectronic mail, a person first needs a mailing address.  This\naddress is comprised of a name followed by a domain. The name is a\nselected identifier which is unique to each person, just like the \nfirst line of a regular mailing address. The domain serves as the \ncomputerized street address. It lets the \"cyberspace mailman\" know\nwhich computer system to deliver the mail to.  Again, like a conventional\nmailing address, it is possible to have two people with the same\nname on the Internet, but they have different domains to distinguish\nbetween the two. This way, everyone on the <b><a href=\"ftp://ftp.concert.net/netinfo/interest-groups.txt\">\nInternet's mailing list</a></b> has a unique and identifiable address. \nIn order to find someone's e-mail address, just dial <b><a href=\"http://www.four11.com/Sled.html\">\n411 (Directory Services)</a></b> for help.\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>How is information linked together on the World \nWide Web? </B></A><br>\n<p>One of the greatest features of the World Wide Web is its ability to link documents and\nresources to each other.
