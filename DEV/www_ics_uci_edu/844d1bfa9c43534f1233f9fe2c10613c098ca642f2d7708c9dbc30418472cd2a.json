Taylor</A>'s\nsoftware research group in the Department of Informatics at UC\nIrvine's School of Information and Computer Science. Depending upon\nhow you count my leave of absence as co-founder of <A\nHREF=\"http://www.knownow.com\">KnowNow</A> with <A\nHREF=\"http://ifindkarma.com/\">Adam Rifkin</A>, it took me either four\nor six years to complete my dissertation, entitled <I><A\nHREF=\"Khare-Thesis-FINAL.pdf\" >Extending the\nR<small>E</small>presentational State Transfer Architectural Style for\nDecentralized Systems</A></I> (also formatted for easier duplex \n<A HREF=\"Khare-Thesis-Duplex.pdf\">printing</A>). It was summarized in a 10-page <A\nHREF=\"ARRESTED-ICSE.pdf\">SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper at ICSE-26</A>\n and an earlier <A\nHREF=\"http://www.isr.uci.edu/tech_reports/UCI-ISR-03-8.pdf\">ISR Tech\nReport</A>)\n<P>\n\nArguably the most important contribution of my research is the answer\nto the challenge posed on <A HREF=\"Acknowledgments.htm\">page xiv</A>: I'm thrilled to be <A\nHREF=\"http://Khare.org/EParty\">engaged</A> to marry the wonderful\nMme. <A HREF=\"http://www.ucsf.edu/cbe/vidwans.htm\">Smruti Jayant\nVidwans</A>. <P>\n\nI've recently joined <A HREF=\"http://Commerce.Net\">CommerceNet</A> as\nDirector of a new research lab; some of our team's thoughts are\navailable on our blog, <A HREF=\"http://TheNowEconomy.com/\">The Now\nEconomy</A>; our website for the <A HREF=\"http://zLab.Commerce.Net\">\nzLab Center for Decentralization</A>; and our <A\nHREF=\"http://zlab.commerce.net/wiki/index.php/Publications#Technical_Reports\">Technical\nReports</A>.<P>\n\n<HR>\n<SMALL>\n<H3>Contributions of the Dissertation</H3>\n\nAcademically, however, the central insight of my work can be\nsummarized by the injuction <I>&ldquo;Decentralization &ne;\nDistribution&rdquo;</I>, as shown in this <A\nHREF=\"DT-vs-DZ-QuadChart.pdf\">summary quad chart</A>. Basically,\ndistributed systems are about letting multiple parties come to\n<I>consensus</I> on a single decision; decentralization requires\npermitting independent parties to make their <i>own</i> decisions. <P>\n\nOf course, permitting disagreement can descend into chaos; the hard\npart is managing the risk caused by disagreement. But manage them we\nmust, since in the long-term, today's consensus-driven, client/server,\ncentral database architectural styles cannot cope with increasing\nnetwork latency and the security threat of conflicting agencies. <P>\n\nThe result is a sequel of sorts to<A HREF=\"../~fielding/\"> Dr. Roy\nFielding</A>'s pioneering work on the <A\nHREF=\"http://rest.blueoxen.net/\">\nR<small>E</small>presentational State Transfer</A> architectural style\nfor the World Wide Web. Starting with the ordinary request/response\nstyle of interaction characteristic of today's Web, I attempted to\nshift from the classic &lsquo;ACID&rsquo; transaction properties to our new\n&lsquo;BASE&rsquo; measures of decentralization (Best-effort\nnetworking, Approximate estimates, Self-centered trust management, and\nEfficient encoding) by successively adding new features to REST. The\nfinal result was Asynchronous, Routed REST with Estimates and\ndecentralized Decision functions (ARRESTED).<P>\n\nPerhaps the most practical stepping-stone along the way, though, was\nARREST: adding publish/subscribe event notification to the Web. In\nretrospect, ARREST best described the open-source <TT><A\nHREF=\"http://www.mod-pubsub.org/blog/\">Mod_PubSub</A></TT> project\nthat eventually grew into KnowNow. At the time, we called it the <A\nHREF=\"ftp://ftp.ora.com/pub/conference/p2p2001/1163/khare_1163.ppt\">Two-Way\nWeb</A>, because it changed the one-way data flow, one-to-one\ntopology, and one-shot unreliability of ordinary HTTP interaction.<P>\n\n\n</small>\n<HR>\n<SMALL>\n<H3>Selected Articles on Application-Layer Protocols</H3>\n\nI was a columnist for for <A\nHREF=\"http://www.computer.org/internet\">IEEE Internet Computing</A>,\nbentitled <A HREF=\"L7-1.html\"><I>Seventh Heaven</I></A> on\napplication-layer message transfer protocols.  These columns were\nabout <A HREF=\"IEEE-L7-v2.html\">Telnet</A>, <A\nHREF=\"IEEE-L7-FTP-COLUMN-FINAL.htm\">FTP</A>, <A\nHREF=\"IEEE-L7-SMTP.html\">SMTP</A>, a memorial to <A\nHREF=\"IEEE-L7-Jon-NNTP.html\">Jon Postel and (NNTP)</A>, <A\nHREF=\"IEEE-L7-http-gopher.html\">Gopher & HTTP</A>, the <A\nHREF=\"IEEE-L7-applcore.html\">APPLCORE</A> protocol unification\ninitiative, the not-invented here risks of the <A\nHREF=\"IEEE-L7-WAP.html\">Wireless Application Protocol</A> suite, and\nthe a pair of columns on <A\nHREF=\"IEEE-L7-namespaces.html\">Internet-Scale Namespaces: Anatomy of a\nURI</A> and <A HREF=\"IEEE-L7-names-trust.html\"> What's in a Name?\nTrust</A>, as well as pair on <A HREF=\"IEEE-L7-Forms.html\">How\n&lt;FORM&gt; Functions</A> and <A\nHREF=\"IEEE-L7-XForms.html\">Transforming XForms</A>.\n<P>\n\nUltimately, this vision comes together as Application-Layer\nInter<small>N</small>etworking, an architectural style for integrating\ndecentralized systems. Its primary avatar is a SOAP Router, as\ndescribed in a presentation from the O'Reilly Emerging Technology\nConference, <A HREF=\"ETcon-SOAProuting.ppt\">SOAP Routing: The Missing\nLink</A>, some corresponding raw <A HREF=\"ETcon-notes.txt\">notes</A>,\na few slides from ISR asking <A HREF=\"ISR-panel-khare.ppt\">&quot;Will\nDecentralization Drive Event-Based Architectures?&quot;</A>, and a\n1998 draft written jointly with Adam Rifkin, <A HREF=\"wacc\">The\nEvolution of Internet-Scale Event Notification Services: Past,\nPresent, and Future</A>.<P>\n</SMALL>\n<HR>\n<SMALL>\n<H3>Biography</H3>\n\nRohit Khare is the <A\nHREF=\"http://zLab.Commerce.Net/wiki/index.php/Rohit_Khare\">Director</A>\nof <A HREF=\"http://zLab.Commerce.Net/\">CommerceNet Labs</A>, which is\ninvestigating decentralized electronic commerce.
