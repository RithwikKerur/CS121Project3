If you have a strong academic background and\na real thirst for success in a real-life project, please consider the following task.\n&nbsp; This is a great opportunity for a TEAM of serious programmers who truly want to\nsolidify their resume.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Overview:<br>\n</b>FlowersWeb.com is a secure E-commerce floral site which launched two years ago and is\nin need of a totally new web site using the latest and greatest software tools and\ntechniques. Documentation is of the essence in this project. Also, since some of our new\nfeatures may be patent-able non-disclosure agreements are required by project members. <br>\nThe current site gives customers a variety of features such as:<br>\n1- E-mail reminders for anniversaries, <br>\n2- Frequent Shopper Program keeps track of customer&#146;s purchases and shows the running\ntotal so customers can redeem free flowers after certain milestones (similar to airlines\nfrequent flyer miles).<br>\n3- Customers can search products by choosing what occasion, price and product they wish.<br>\n4- Customers can select flowers for International delivery by clicking on a specific\nCountry.<br>\n5- Site allows one to register and thus reap the benefits of &#147;membership&#148;.<br>\n6- Customers that register can maintain a list of recipients for future purchases (a\npersonal directory) available only to them.<br>\n7- On the backend, the site is completely dynamically generated, thus allowing easy and\nimmediate editing of products, prices, descriptions, etc. and similar search/editing\ncapabilities for customers database.<br>\n8- The site keeps the customer data on file whether the person registers or not.<br>\n9- Bulk E-mail capabilities to all users for direct marketing.<br>\n10- Some editable text messages on certain pages.<br>\n11- The site transmits the order to our in-house Unix system via modem within three\nminutes of receiving the order.<br>\n<b>Due to the amount of work we believe two teams are needed for the whole project. Thus\nwe think that SOW items 1 through 5 should be one team &amp; items 6 -10 should be\nanother. However we are flexible on this (should more teams want to participate).<br>\n<br>\nStatement of Work:<br>\n</b>1-The goal is to build from scratch a new web site using the best tools currently\navailable so that the current features (some of which are shown above) and others to be\ndiscussed later can be added making Flowersweb.com the ultimate flower site on the\nInternet. Floral arrangement images are already available in JPG formats. No additional\nPhotoshop type work is needed.<br>\n2- Additionally the site must be duplicated using different domains so that ultimately\nidentical sites can be leased to florists around the country and hosted by FlowersWeb\nservers but linked together via a back end administration page so that control over what\nimages the individual sites show can be maintained as well as &#147;other&#148;\nadministrative tasks. For instance reporting capabilities for total $$ sales per site,\ntotal number of orders between a certain time frame, etc.<br>\n3- Since individuality between florists is needed, three to five graphical options are\nrequired so that florists have a choice of what their personal site will look like,\nkeeping the back end the same.<br>\n4- It would be ideal if certain mutually agreed upon options were modules that we were\nable to turn on and off. For instance, not all sites may require International\ncapabilities or Cybersource. This would allow the site to be leased at a lower rate, etc.<br>\n5- In order to keep costs down to a minimum, a secure front-end interface is required so\nthat each independent florist can enter their own personal data, such as &#147;About\nus&#148;, &#147;Our Guarantee&#148;, &#147;Special Offers&#148;, Ending messages on order\nconfirmations, etc. This will allow each retailer to change it at will without requiring\nany of our intervention and associated costs. Many pages will be the same for all sites\n(i.e.: How it works).<br>\n6- A Firewall should be selected and installed to secure possible hack attacks.<br>\n7- Secure credit card transactions should be done by Cybersource (Cybercash may be ok,\nlet&#146;s discuss it).<br>\n8- The Affiliate program (<u><font color=\"#0000ff\"><a\nhref=\"http://www.theaffiliateprogram.com/\" eudora=\"autourl\">www.theaffiliateprogram.com</a></font></u>)\nsoftware should be installed to begin large-scale marketing program. This is a simple\ninstall that they will do for us.<br>\n9- Once the customer places the order and it has been approved, the question then is how\nto get the order details &#147;into&#148; the flower shop&#146;s mainframe system without\nany retyping. We have a software tool that successfully and seamlessly addresses this for\nour Unix SCO computer system. However it will be required that other systems be able to\naccept the data so that ultimately the florist can seamlessly receive orders without\nhaving to check the web site. Particularly at holidays, the volume is quite high and thus\nthe orders must be sent directly to the flower shop for immediate processing, whether they\nhave our type of computer system, or any of four other platforms.<br>\n10-Once the main site is up, we will market it via doorway pages using Web Position Gold. <br>\n<br>\n<b>Project Requirements:<br>\n</b>The current hardware is a Sun Ultra II with dual 200 Mhz processors and 512 MB of ram\n(owned by Flowersweb, Inc.) and Sun Solaris (latest rev). The additional software can be\n(but is not limited to) Cold Fusion, Apache server, Oracle relational database, or similar\nprograms. An eye towards multiple servers and having a multiple swappable hard drive array\nfor ultimate performance must be kept (as this is eventually our goal).<br>\n<br>\n<b>The Challenge:<br>\n</b>1-Having many sites running without over tasking the servers is among other things a\nfunction of optimum database programming. One poorly designed site can be slower than\ndozens of well designed ones (considering all would be running on the same servers). At\nlaunch, Flowersweb.com received over 350,000 hits over a 24-hour period (Valentine&#146;s\n&#146;98). Volume is higher than you think at holidays, thus expect the worst and triple\nit.<br>\n2- A floral site is very graphic intensive and every page may have several pictures so it\ntends to slow down the site. Thus the site must be designed from the ground up keeping\ndownload time at the top of the priorities.<br>\n3- Being able to seamlessly download the order without any re-typing into our computer is\none reason for our growth. Being able to do it for most shops in the country, regardless\nof their platform is the key to ultimate success.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Constraints:<br>\n</b>Based on our learning curve, we have what we think is a very simple order process\nalready, no need to re-invent the wheel, but if you can do it better, we are all ears.\nThus the only constraint is your imagination.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Customer Contact:<br>\n</b>FlowersWeb, Inc.<br>\nAl Devile, President<br>\n714-965-1000, E-mail: <font color=\"#0000ff\"><u>aldevile@gte.net</u>&nbsp; <u><a\nhref=\"http://www.flowersweb.com/\" eudora=\"autourl\">www.flowersweb.com</a></u></font> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a HREF=\"projects.html\">ICS125 WQ00 Project Opportunities<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"../ics125.html\">ICS125 WQ00<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
