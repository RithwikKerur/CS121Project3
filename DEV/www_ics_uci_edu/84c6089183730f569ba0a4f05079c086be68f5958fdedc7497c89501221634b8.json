Having it due Wednesday of the tenth week will give you an extra lab day and a weekend, plus a couple of extra days after that to go back and review what you need for the final.</P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P><font  ><strong>Preparation</strong></font> (Do this part individually):\n<!-- <P><font  ><strong>(Zyante readers) </strong></font>Read sections 6.5\u20136.7, and 2.11.</P> -->\nRead sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4, doing the practice problems as you go (but you can skip problem 6.10).</P>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><font  ><strong>Lab Work</strong></font> (Do this part with your partner in lab)</p>\n<p><strong>(a)</strong> Choose a partner for this assignment, someone you haven't worked with before, and register your partnership using the <a href=\"http://ics31-partner-app.appspot.com/\">partner app</a>, ideally by Wednesday. Make sure you know your partner's name (first and last) and contact information (Email or cellphone or whatever) in case one of you can't make it to lab.</p>\n<!--\n<p>You should choose a partner whose Thanksgiving schedule is compatible with yours; if you won't be here for lab on the day before Thanksgiving, pick someone who's able to work with you for a few extra out-of-lab hours before then. If you can't meet in person, collaborate on line using Skype or Google Hangouts or some other tool.</p> -->\n<p> We said this last week, but it bears repeating: <em>Do not</em> engage in any of the following practices; they are not acceptable and may result in reduced scores or worse: (i) working solo (this lab, like all labs in this course, is a pair programming assignment); (ii) splitting the lab with your partner (&quot;You do (c), I'll do (d) and (e)&quot; and just pasting the the parts together and turning them in\u2014this is not pair programming and both partners won't learn the concepts (which of course may show up on exams or in later courses); (iii) working with someone other than your official partner. Points (ii) and (iii) could land you in academic honesty trouble, too: If you don't participate in the development of everything you turn in, you don't know whether your partner might have gotten code from an illegitimate source, and since you're responsible for code submitted by your partner, you could get into hot water for what your partner did. Too many people landed in trouble just this way in last quarter's class. You and your official partner should collaborate on your own joint work. If collaborating means you don't get quite as far as you might have gotten by one of these other impermissible strategies, your score will still be higher than if you're detected doing something impermissible.</p>\n<p><strong>(b)</strong> Prepare your <code>lab9.py</code> file as in previous labs, including a line like this: </p>\n<pre>\n#  Paula Programmer 11223344 and Andrew Anteater 44332211.  ICS 31 Lab sec 7.  Lab asst 9.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong>(c)</strong> Suppose a class  takes a multiple-choice test. We're going to experiment with alternative scoring mechanisms. For this problem you'll want to  say <code>from random import *</code> (and use the methods  <code>randrange</code> and  <code>choice</code>, which you can look up in the text or using  <code>help(random)</code>.)</p>\n<p>Let's say you have these three global constants defined (a complete program might determine these values from reading a file; we're just doing it this way for convenience):</p>\n<pre><code>NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS = 200\nNUMBER_OF_QUESTIONS = 20\nNUMBER_OF_CHOICES = 4  # 3 choices is A/B/C, 4 choices is A/B/C/D, 5 is A/B/C/D/E</code>\n</pre>\n<p>Use the identifiers <code>NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS</code>, <code>NUMBER_OF_QUESTIONS</code>, and <code>NUMBER_OF_CHOICES</code> in your code rather than the hard-coded constants 200, 20, and 4. And of course your code should work correctly when different values are assigned to these identifiers.</p>\n<p><strong>(c.1)</strong> Write a function called <code>generate_answers</code> that generates and returns a string of letters representing the correct answers to the test. (Of course answers to real tests aren't chosen randomly! We're just doing it this way to produce some test data to use when we score students' answers.) The length of the string should be the number of questions; each character in the string should be chosen randomly from the first <em>n</em> letters of the alphabet (where <em>n</em> is the number of choices). [Use the <code>choice()</code> method.]</p>\n<p>Call <code>generate_answers</code> to generate the answers we'll use; assign the result to another global constant called <code>ANSWERS</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>(c.2) </strong>Ideally, we'd read  the students and their exam answers from a file. But to save you some time, we'll skip the file-reading part and just generate a random list of students and their answers. To start with, let's say that each student is represented by a string for the student's name or ID and a string representing the student's answers to each question. [Are you thinking of a namedtuple with two fields? You should be.]</p>\n<pre><code>Student = namedtuple('Student', 'name answers')\ns1 = Student('Jones, Jane', 'ABCCDAABAABCBBCACCAD')\n</code><code>s2 = Student('Smith, Sam',  'BADACCABADCCABDDCBAB')</code>\n</pre>\n<p>Write the function  <code>random_students</code> that uses the global constants above to generate and return a list of Student namedtuples. The size of the list is the number of students. The names can be randomly generated as you did in an earlier lab or, to save time, you can just generate a random ID number using <code>randrange()</code>. The string representing the student's answers should be generated precisely the same way as you generated the correct answers (so don't duplicate any code!).</p>\n<p><strong>(c.3)</strong> Modify the <code>Student</code> namedtuple to add two fields, one containing a list of scores on each question (1 if the student's answer matches the correct answer and 0 otherwise) and the other a number representing the sum of the list of question scores:</p>\n<pre><code>Student = namedtuple('Student', 'name answers scores total')\ns1 = Student('Jones, Jane', 'ABCCDAABAABCBBCACCAD', [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, ...], 10)\n</code><code>s2 = Student('Smith, Sam',  'BADACCABADCCABDDCBAB', [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, ...], 5)</code></pre>\n<p>Then modify your   <code>random_students</code> function to generate these student records with scores.</p>\n<p>Generate your list of random students and then sort it by total, highest total to lowest, and print the top 10 students' names. (You can print them all; we're just trying to save paper and screen space here.) Also print the mean (average) score for all the students.</p>\n<p><strong>(c.4) </strong>This previous part used a conventional way to score multiple-choice exams. But you should expect the scores on this exam to be lower than on a typical real exam: On a real exam, students on the average are likelier to choose the correct answers than the wrong ones, but we generated our data completely at random. So let's think about how to generate more realistically distributed random data.</p>\n<p>We chose each student's answer to each question above by choosing randomly from (let's say) A, B, C, and D. If the correct answer is C, we can bias the selection towards C by choosing randomly from A, B, C, D, and C\u2014adding another copy of the correct answer to the possible choices will increase the likelihood that a random choice from that group will be the correct answer. A group of A, B, C, D, C, and C should produce the correct answer about half the time, since half the choices in the group are the correct answer. So every time we generate a student's answer to a question, we can add to the group of answer choices a few extra copies of the correct answer\u2014for each question let's choose randomly between 0 and twice the number of choices, so that with four choices we'd add from 0 to 8 copies of the correct choice\u2014and choose the student's answer randomly from that enhanced group of answer choices.</p>\n<p>We can do this by defining a function called   <code>generate_weighted_student_answer</code> that takes a string (one character, the correct answer) and returns a string (one character, the student answer chosen randomly from the enhanced group of alternatives as described above). Write a new function called   <code>random_students2</code> that's based on your   <code>random_students</code> function but that generates each student's answer to each question by calling <code>generate_weighted_student_answer</code>.</p>\n<p>Generate a new list of students using <code>random_students2</code> and then sort it, highest total to lowest, and print the top 10 students' names. Also print the mean (average) score; it should be higher than in part (c.3).</p>\n<p><strong>(c.5)</strong> An unconventional way to score this exam would be to assign different weights to different questions. The instructor might assign those weights in advance, based on his or her judgement of which questions are harder or more important. But an even more unconventional way to assign the weights would be to derive them from the students' answers: The questions that were harder (i.e., that fewer people answered correctly) are worth more points than the easier ones.</p>\n<p>One way to implement this would be to assign a number of points to each problem, that number being equal to the number of students who missed the problem. Write a function called <code>question_weights</code> that takes a list of Student records and returns a list of numbers, one number for each question on the test, where each number is the number of students who answered that question incorrectly. [Hint: It's helpful to attack complex data structures layer by layer. Try writing code that counts the number of wrong answers to a single question; then apply that in turn to all the questions.] Create another global constant that consists of the results of calling <code>question_weights</code> on your list of students from part (c.4).</p>\n<p>Then write a function called<code> Student_weighted_score</code> that takes a Student record and the list of question weights and returns that Student record with its total field changed to reflect that student's score based on his or her correct answers and the corresponding question weights. Then apply <code> Student_weighted_score</code> to each student on your list of students from part (c.4). Finally, sort the result, highest total to lowest, and print the top 10 students' names along with the mean (average) score for all the students. These scores are likely to be much higher than the standard 0\u2013100: In a 350-person class, a single question could be worth 350 points. We could normalize the scores by dividing each by the number of students. Do that, then re-sort and re-print the top 10 as before.</p>\n<p><strong>(d)</strong> Do these Python exercises:\n<!-- Replacement for Exercise 6.12\n\nSolution:\ndef calculate_GPA(list_of_grades: list) -> float:\n\tGPA = 0\n\tfor grade in list_of_grades:\n\t\tif grade == 'A':\n\t\t\tGPA += 4\n\t\telif grade == 'B':\n\t\t\tGPA += 3\n\t\telif grade == 'C':\n\t\t\tGPA += 2\n\t\telif grade == 'D':\n\t\t\tGPA += 1\n\t\telif grade == 'F':\n\t\t\tGPA += 0\n\treturn GPA / len(list_of_grades)\n\ndef calculate_GPA2(list_of_grades: list) -> float:\n\tGPA = 0\n\tweights = {'A': 4, 'B': 3, 'C': 2, 'D': 1, 'F': 0}\n\tfor grade in list_of_grades:\n\t\tGPA += weights[grade]\n\treturn GPA / len(list_of_grades)\n-->\n\n<p><strong>(d.1a)</strong> Implement the function <code>calculate_GPA</code> that takes as input a list of strings representing letter grades and returns the grade point average (out of 4 with A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, and F=0) computed from the list.

Pay very close attention to the instructions, especially about developing the program in incremental stages.\n<p>[If you find yourself printing menus or calling <code>input()</code>, for example, you are doing it wrong: You did not read and understand the problem description. This is serious; this is the big time, relatively speaking. You have to follow the methodology we've been teaching all quarter long.]\n<p>And have some perspective here: This is one part of one assignment in the course. People will probably get full credit on this assignment without completing the entire B&amp;B program. And even one slightly lower score on one lab assignment isn't likely to have a major effect on your ultimate grade in the course. But if you turn in code with bugs, or even worse, if you turn in code that was developed through impermissible collaboration, that could be a serious problem.\n<p><strong>(f)</strong> (optional) If you have some extra time after completing the previous parts of the lab, try one or more of the following.  In fact, if you're continuing to ICS 32 you might try some of these over the break to keep your skills up.\n<ul>\n  <li>Add a menu-style user interface to ICStunes, similar to the interface we used for the restaurants program. </li>\n  <li>Add external files to ICStunes, along the same lines as we did with the restaurants program. We didn't require this or the user interface because you've done similar things before, but they're bread-and-butter everyday programming skills, so it wouldn't hurt to have more practice.</li>\n  <li>Implement a weighted scoring scheme that's less extreme than the one in (c.4): A problem is worth 1 point if over 75% of the class answer it correctly; it's worth 2 points if over 50% (but not over 75%) answer it correctly; it's worth 3 points if over 25% (but not over 50%) answer it correctly; it's worth 4 points otherwise. Score the same list of students using this scheme.</li>\n  <li>Devise some kind of visualization (perhaps a two-dimensional plot) to show how the same student scores using the three different scoring schemes. Try to produce a graphical answer to the question, Do the same students score highly under all three schemes?</li>\n  <li>Develop an interactive interface for the Anteater BandB or other enhancements discussed in the problem writeup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>(g)</strong> <span style=\"font-variant:normal; letter-spacing:normal; line-height:normal; orphans:2; text-align:start; text-indent:0px; text-transform:none; white-space:normal; widows:2; word-spacing:0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust:auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); display:inline !important; float:none; font-family:AGaramond, Garamond, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size:medium; color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-style:normal; font-weight:normal;\"> Remember that each partner must complete a partner evaluation form and submit it individually.
