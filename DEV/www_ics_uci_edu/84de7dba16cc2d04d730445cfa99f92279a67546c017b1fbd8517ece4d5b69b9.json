If you have to miss lecture for any\nreason, please ask one of your classmates to fill you\nin on what you missed.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere are two lab sections for this class. Each lab section has\nthree scheduled hours in the lab.\nDuring these times, you have a guaranteed seat in  the lab.\nNote, however, you only have priority over\nother students if you are working on class work (i.e. not\nplaying games).\nShenhyue will be available in the lab during these times\nto answer questions.\nThis is an ideal opportunity to get some help with your\nlab homework in front of a computer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThere are several department labs which you can use\nfor working on your lab assignments.\nInformation about the locations and hours of the\nlabs can be found at\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab\">\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab </a>.\nKeep in mind that some of these labs may be reserved for other\nclasses during the day, so you may not have first priority\nto these machines at all times.\nIt is possible that the labs will be\nvery crowded on the day an assignment is due.\nIt is your responsibility to take this into account\nas I can not accept\ncrowded labs as an excuse for late lab assigments.\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>Obtaining Assistance</h3>\nThe best way to get your questions answered is by coming\nto lecture, office hours or lab and asking them there.\nIn general,\nif I'm not busy with something else, I am happy to answer\nshort questions while I am in my office, so feel free to\nstop by during other times in the week.\n\n<p>\nAll email with questions about course material should be sent to the\nfollowing email address:\n<A href=\"mailto:ics23-questions@ics.uci.edu\">ics23-questions@ics.uci.edu</A>.\nThis is an alias for the instructor and the TA.  It ensures\nthat we both see your message and the response.  It also gives you better\nturnaround time.\n<LI>Please also include the following information:\n<UL>\n<LI> The string \"ICS 23:\" at the beginning of the subject line\n<LI> Your name\n<LI> Your student number\n</UL>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf you are experiencing difficulties in the lab with the\nequipment, let the lab attendant know.\nIf they can not solve the problem, they will contact\nsupport.\n\n<H3>Course Announcements</H3>\n<UL>\n<LI>Course announcements will be sent via email to all students enrolled\nin the class, at their official UCI email address.\n<LI>\n<A  href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/m09/16030/\">Click here</A> for the\narchive of these messages.\n</UL>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Assignments</h3>\n\n<p>\n<b> Lab assignments </b>\nwill be due every two weeks at Friday 5PM.\nPlease see the <a href=\"LabManual.html\">\nLab Manual </a> for instructions on handing in assignments\nand policies on late assignments.\n</p>\n\n\n<p>\n<b> Weekly quizes: </b>\nI will give a very short weekly quiz at the beginning of class every\nMonday. Since we have two Monday holidays, we will make up those\nquizes on the preceding Friday. Here are a list of quiz days:\n\n<br><br>\n\n<table border>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nMonday\n</td>\n<td>\nJanuary 11\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nFriday\n</td>\n<td>\nJanuary 15\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nMonday\n</td>\n<td>\nJanuary 25\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nMonday\n</td>\n<td>\nFebruary 1\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nMonday\n</td>\n<td>\nFebruary 8\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nFriday\n</td>\n<td>\nFebruary 12\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nMonday\n</td>\n<td>\nFebruary 22\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nMonday\n</td>\n<td>\nMarch 1\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nMonday\n</td>\n<td>\nMarch 8\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n\n\n\nThe quizes will last approximately 10 minutes and will be given out\nat the beginning of lecture. They will cover material from the preceding week.\nOn the two occasions that quizes are given Friday, they will cover material\nfrom lectures on Monday and Wednesday.\nIn determining your course score, I will drop the lowest two quiz scores.\nHowever, these dropped scores are intended to cover any missed quizes\nfor whatever reason you need to miss a quiz. This includes any medical\nproblems, personal issues or school-related events.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI will grade the quizes and Shenhyue will grade the lab assignments.\nIf you have questions regarding grading, please see the person who\ngraded that particular item.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Text</h3>\n\n<p>\nWe have one required text for this course.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<em> Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 4th. edition.</em>, by\nMichael Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia.\n</li>\n</ul>\nYou may also find it useful to purchase a Java reference book\nif you do not already have one. Different styles suit different\npeople, so I will leave it up to you to select your own.\n<h3>Course Structure</h3>\n\nThe grading criteria for the course is:\n<ul>\nAttendance 5%<br>\nLab assignments 40%<br>\nQuizes 30%<br>\nFinal 25%<br>\n</ul>\n\n\n<H3>Missed Final Exam Policy</H3>\n<UL>\n<LI> If you miss the final exam and do not have a valid reason, you will receive\na score of 0 on the exam.\n<LI> The following policy applies if you miss the final exam for a valid reason.\n<UL>\n<LI>\nThere are only two classes of valid reasons for missing the final exam:\n<OL>\n<LI>  An unforeseeable emergency, such as a medical emergency.\nIn such cases I will ask for documentation.\n<LI> An absence from an exam due to a foreseeable circumstance\nthat I have approved in advance.\n</OL>\n<LI>\nA work conflict is NOT a valid reason for missing the final exam.\nThe examination times\nare announced at the beginning of the quarter, so there is plenty of\ntime to plan your work schedule.\n<LI> If you wait until after the exam to get a foreseeable excuse approved,\nand it is not approved,\nyou will receive a grade of zero (0) on the exam.\n<LI> If I accept your reason for missing the final exam, at my option I may\neither (1) give you a makeup exam or (2) assign your grade on the basis\nof the remaining course work that you did not miss.\n<LI> If I give a makeup exam, I may give it less weight\nthan announced on the course web page.\n</UL>\n</UL>\n\n<h3>Academic Dishonesty</h3>\n\n<p>As ICS 23 students, you are expected to know and follow the\nacademic dishonesty policies of both the ICS School and the\nUniversity as a whole.  Please take a few minutes to read the\npolicies, which can be found at\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php\">this link</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All of your lab work is expected to be completed <i>solely by you</i>.  Group work and/or sharing of code between students is not permitted.  Note that \"high-level discussion of course material for better understanding\" is permitted and encouraged, but when it comes time to sit down and write code, that is expected to be done by you and you alone.  All submissions are compared to one another using an automated plagiarism detection system.  This system is extraordinarily good at finding similarities between submissions, even when there are superficial differences.  (Note that we also compare your submissions to those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these assignments was given during a previous quarter, so it is an exceedingly bad idea to turn in, or even refer to, code written by a friend of yours who took the course already.)</p>\n\n<p>Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you, you will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small portion of someone else's project.</p>\n\n<p>Academic dishonesty is a two-way street.  Providing your code to other students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted anymore than turning in someone else's code.  Resist the temptation to give code to your friends \"for reference.\"  Based on my experience, I can say that your \"friends\" may very well betray you and turn it in, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>Violators of academic dishonesty policies are subject to the\npenalties described in the ICS School's policy.  They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade.  Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into the ICS major, registering for the ICS minor, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from ICS with honors.</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
