First, I\u2019ll give a review of collaborative authoring scenarios and features in the word processing arena. Right now the leading workgroup word processors have a fairly rich feature set for collaborative authoring that\u2019s quite unmatched by anything in the Web authoring area. At first thought that might seem to give us some short-term advantage in a battle over file formats. But what we really want to do is take what we\u2019ve already learned through years of studying users in workgroup scenarios, and apply that to the Web. For examples, I\u2019ll focus on Word 7.0, which actually has the same collaborative authoring feature set as Word 6.0. Just to be fair, though, I\u2019ll mention some interesting work that Lotus has done on Word Pro 96.</P>\n\n<P></P>\n\n<P>Second, I\u2019ll give a very high-level overview of Word\u2019s future plans in collaborative authoring. Unfortunately I can\u2019t give you too many specifics about Word 8, which is coming out this fall. But I\u2019ll try to tell you what I can.</P>\n\n<P></P>\n\n<P>Next, I\u2019ll talk about some of the issues we\u2019ll need to answer in order to have a collaborative authoring Web feature set based on open standards.</P>\n\n<P> </P> \n</Body>\n</HTML>", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
