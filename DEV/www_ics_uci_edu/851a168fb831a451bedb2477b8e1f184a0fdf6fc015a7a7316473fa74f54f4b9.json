Suppose that, instead, we want to list all the vertices that belong to at least one cycle. Describe how to do this efficiently using a different DFS-based algorithm. (If it helps simplify the problem, you may assume that every cycle has at least two vertices.)</p></li>\n\n<li><p>How many different topological orderings does the graph shown below have? List them all.</p>\n<p align=center><img src=\"s12-hw2-dag1.png\"/></p></li>\n\n<li><p><ol type=\"a\"><li>What is the minimum number of layers needed in a layered drawing of the graph shown below? Draw the graph with this many layers.</li>\n<li>How many layers would be needed if we limited the number of vertices in each layer to two? Again, draw the graph with this many layers.</li></ol>\n<p align=center><img src=\"s12-hw2-dag2.png\"/></p></li>\n\n<li><p>Find a directed acyclic graph G on four vertices with the property that G, the transitive closure of G, and the transitive reduction of G are all different from each other.
