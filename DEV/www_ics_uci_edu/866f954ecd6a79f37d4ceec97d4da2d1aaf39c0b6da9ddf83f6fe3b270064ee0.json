We could call these\nthree themes design (How do we represent our problem so we can solve it\nwith software?), implementation (How do we decide which of the many alternatives\nwould be best for building this solution?), and communication (How can we\ncharacterize our solution, especially its efficiency in consuming machine\nresources under various conditions, in a way that other informaticians will\nunderstand?).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Prerequisite concepts:</B>  This course\nexpects Informatics 41 as a prerequisite.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Meeting place and times:  </B>Lecture meets\nsix hours each week in Bren Hall 1500:  Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30 to 10:50\nand also from 2:00 to 3:20.

The most current version is Java 6; the previous version (Java 5, also known as Java 1.5) is perfectly fine for our purposes.  Earlier versions (Java 1.4.2 and earlier) lack some important features. If you wish to work from home, you can find instructions about obtaining and installing Java on Alex's page: </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=2><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics22/LabManual/SettingUpJava.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~thornton/ics22/LabManual/SettingUpJava.html</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">.\n </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Other useful addresses:  </B>We may distribute\nsome course materials at the Engineering Copy Center (ECC), in Engineering\nTower 203; the ECC is open 8-12 and 1-4:30, Monday through Friday.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Course structure:\n<BR>\n</B><I><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i42/hw/index.html\">Weekly homework assignments  and roughly bi-weekly lab assignments</A>,</I>\nsome on paper and some on line (25% of the course grade).

Scores on the scale shown below will get the grades indicated,\nbut in the past the actual cutoffs have often been significantly lower;\nthis means that you should not assume your grade will be as low as the scale\nindicates.  If you&#39;re concerned, check with your TA or the instructor.\n The basic scale is:  grades in the A range (A&ndash;, A, and in exceptional cases,\nA+), 90% and above; grades in the B range, 80%&ndash;90%; grades in the C range,\n70%&ndash;80%.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Your TA has primary responsibility for evaluating\nyour work; go to her first for any questions about grading or scoring. \nIf that does not resolve your question, then see the instructor.  The TA\nand instructor will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we\nmust ask that you bring us your grading questions within a week after the\nitem is returned; the course moves quickly, and we simply can&#39;t deal\nwith assignments long past.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">We&#39;re required to say that in unusual circumstances,\nthese criteria could change, but we do not expect that to happen.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>What to do this week to get started in Informatics\n42:\n<BR>\n</B>&#8212; If you do not have a UCInet ID (an account on the EA system for reading\nelectronic mail), get one.

It&#39;s\nnot fair to ask the TA simply to repeat lecture material you missed, though\nof course she will answer questions about it.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Attend your lab section, too, since your partner depends on your presence.\n<!-- assignments will be discussed and completed there, exams will be reviewed\nthere, and you can hear a different perspective there than you can in lecture.-->\nDon&#39;t hesitate to ask your TA to cover things that will help you.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Check your electronic mail regularly; this\nis an official channel for course announcements.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Keep up with the reading; you&#39;ll need it\nto do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed\npages can quickly become a few chapters if you&#39;re not careful.  Our\ntext contains some details that won&#39;t be vital for your work.  You will\nwant to read the assigned sections early and quickly (for the main ideas,\nnot to memorize every detail); then you can ask your TA in section which\nparts merit closer attention.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">The assignments, like all technical specifications,\nrequire careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back\nto the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about\nwhat&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure\nto read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Start each assignment early.  Programming always\ntakes longer to complete than you think it will, even if you have previous\nprogramming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll have time to ask\nin discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">If you find yourself having trouble or getting\nbehind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  But <I>never</I> take the\nshortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and turning it in; the consequences\ncan be far worse than just a low score on a lab assignment.  ICS takes academic\nhonesty very seriously; for a more complete discussion, see the ICS departmental\nweb page covering academic honesty issues (</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=2><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Always keep your own copy of each assignment,\nboth electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\nshuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),\nwe&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.  Finally,\nturn in whatever portion of the assignment you have completed on the due\ndate.  In some circumstances you may arrange with your TA to work further\non an assignment after the due date, but you must turn in whatever you have\nwhen the official due date comes.   </FONT></P>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>Approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLSPACING=1 WIDTH=100% CELLPADDING=1>\n<COL WIDTH=7%><COL WIDTH=14%><COL WIDTH=79%>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=7% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Week</U></FONT></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=14% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Date</U></FONT></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=79% VALIGN=TOP>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><U>Topics (and chapters in the Goodrich/Tamassia\ntext)</U></FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=7% VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
