(Cf. the Knuth-Kotani puzzle,\nwhich asks one to find the point on the surface of a 1-by-1-by-2 box\nthat is farthest from one of the corners; it is not the opposite corner.)\n\nHowever, one might still conjecture that the maximum distance between\ntwo points in the surface metric, as BOTH of them vary over the surface,\nis achieved by a pair of antipodal points.  (This is believed to be true\nin the case of an a-by-b-by-c box for all a, b, and c, though to my\nknowledge no proof is known even for this very special case.)\n\nCan anyone prove or disprove the conjecture?  (Is the convexity condition\nnecessary?)\n\nJim Propp\nDepartment of Mathematics\nM.I.T.\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Sat, 2 Feb 2002 10:45:37 -0800 (PST)\n<B>From:</B>           Costin Vilcu &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:costin_v@yahoo.com\">costin_v@yahoo.com</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        antipodes on convex surfaces\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nDear Professor Eppstein,\n\nI would like to inform you that the open problem of\nJim Propp you propose at \n <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/eppstein/junkyard/open.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/eppstein/junkyard/open.html</A>\nconcerning antipodes on convex surfaces has been\nsolved.\n\nBy Proposition 6 (pp. 273) in\n Geometriae Dedicata 79: 267-275 (2000),\ntwo points realizing the intrinsic diameter of a\ncentrally symmetric convex surface must be symmetric\n(under the same symmetry).\n\nThe proof holds more generally, for any centrally\nsymmetric surface of genus 0.\n\nI proposed there the following problem:\n Prove or disprove that, if on a centrally symmetric\nconvex surface every point x has an unique farthest\npoint F(x) then x and F(x) must be symmetric (under\nthe same symmetry).\n(Notice that on boxes there are points with two\nfarthest points.)\n\nMeanwhile this problem was also solved -getting a\nnegative answer- and appears in a short joint paper\nwritten with Prof. T. Zamfirescu, my thesis advisor.\nThis paper is not yet published.\n\nSincerely Yours,\nCostin VILCU\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
