Fielding\" &lt;<a href=\"mailto:fielding@liege.ICS.UCI.EDU\">fielding@liege.ICS.UCI.EDU</a>&gt;\n|\n| &gt; \tNow Roy Fielding says that Content-Version is opaque and could\n| &gt; \tbe used exactly for this purpose, 'cause no one would be the wiser\n| &gt; \tif the Content-Version were different for each checkout of the\n| &gt; \tsame document.  This is true, but now the names of these fields\n| &gt; \tare losing their meaning, no?  If it's checkout context, call it\n| &gt; \t\"Checkout-Context\" (or \"Checkout-Cookie\").\n|\n| Checkout does not have meaning on all systems, whereas version has a generic\n| meaning (at times, too generic). It is intended to be as flexible as possible.\n| The \"Content-\" prefix is a requirement of MIME for what HTTP calls\n| entity-header field names.\n\nNot to beat a dead horse (but this one's still kicking):\n\nI'm pushing for us to recognise \"checkout\" as a meaningful act for the\nversion abstraction we are trying to support, whether or not the underlying\nsystem can make real use of it.  It means \"GET the SOURCE for EDIT\".\n\"GET\" because the document has to be fetched (or via existing methods\ndetermined that the user has the requested copy), \"the SOURCE\" because\nthe user needs the document as it is prior to any server-side\ninterpretation, and \"for EDIT\" so that the VC backend is aware of the\nuser's activity.\n\nAll VC systems can cook up a checkout cookie; some VC system will have\ndifficulty without one.  The simpler systems - RCS, SCCS, and CVS may\nwell be wrapped with some layer that provides the context.\n\nHere's how I see them being used, again with Perforce thrown into the\nmix because it has fairly modern VC semantics:\n\n\t\tCHECKOUT\t\tLOCK\t\t\tCHECKIN\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRCS\t\tProbably just\t\tVerifies that\t\tVerifies\nSCCS\t\temits URL+version,\tthe cookie\t\tthat cookie\n\t\tso that the\t\trepresents\t\trepresents\n\t\tsubsequent\t\tthe head rev.\t\tLOCKed rev.\n\t\tLOCK or SUBMIT\t\tMay be a no-op\n\t\tcan make sure user \tif the SCCS/RCS\n\t\thas the head rev.\twrapper does\n\t\tMay imply LOCK,\t\tLOCK on CHECKOUT.\n\t\tsince RCS/SCCS don't\n\t\tnormally support\n\t\tunlocked checkout.\n\nCVS\t\tEmits the line\t\tThrows up its\t\tVerifies\n\t\tfrom the CVS/Entries\thands because\t\tthat cookie\n\t\tfile that reflects\tCVS doesn't\t\trepresents\n\t\tthe file+rev being\tsupport locking.\thead rev.\n\t\tedited.\n\nClearCase\tEmits view-extended\tVerifies that\t\tVerifies\n\t\tpathname and rev of\tcookie represents\tthat cookie\n\t\tfile being checked out.\tchecked-out file\trepresents\n\t\tBecause of CC's auto-\tand does a CC\t\tLOCKed rev.\n\t\tbranching, the rev may\treserved checkout.\n\t\tbe different that what\n\t\twas requested.\n\nPerforce\tEmits client pathname\tVerifies that\t\tVerfies\n\t\tand rev of file\t\tcookie represents\tthat cookie\n\t\tbeing checked out.\tchecked out file.\trepresents\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thead rev.\n\nThere is use for the checkout cookie for all these systems, even if the\ncookied degrades into being little more than \"Content-Version\".  Since\nAll VC systems can make use of the cookies, and some need them for sane\noperation (checkin without checkout under clearcase is a no-go), it makes\nsense to use a single tag across all underlying VC systems.\n\nIMHO, of course.\n\nChristopher\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0151.html\">Robert S.
