An interesting aspect of these meetings is the \nsignificant value added by holding them on neutral grounds. This fosters \nthe unrestrained sharing of ideas and experiences important to community \ndevelopment. IRUS will continue to initiate new technical interchange, \nroundtable, and networking meetings modeled after SPIN and BART as their \nneed is identified by the IRUS \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/sponsorship.html#Exec_Com\">\nExecutive Committee</a>. \nPotential topics of interest may be prototyped with \n<A HREF=\"focused_tech_symp.html\">\nFocused Technology Symposia</a>\nto \nsubstantiate their relevance.\n\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">Back to the IRUS home page</A>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n \n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
