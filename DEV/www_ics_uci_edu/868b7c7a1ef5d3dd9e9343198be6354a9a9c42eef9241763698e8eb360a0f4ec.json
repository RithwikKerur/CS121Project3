They were\ndeveloped by the Arcadia Project at the University of California,\nIrvine.  Aflex is based on the tool 'flex' written by Vern Paxson.\nThese tools are copyrighted, but are freely redistributable.  There is\nno warranty of any kind (see the copyright notice.)  However we\ndo ask that you report any problems you encounter as we use these\ntools ourselves and we want to fix any bugs that are found.\n\n<P>\n\nYou may give this software to others, but we prefer that those who can\nget it directly from us to insure that all users are running the\nlatest version.  We also ask that you send electronic mail to the\naddress irus-software-request@ics.uci.edu giving your name, your\norganization, a paper mail address, and your e-mail address (either an\nInternet address or a UUCP path relative to a well-known site such as\nuunet.)  A form is provided below for your convenience.  We will use\nthis information to set up a mailing list to announce new versions of\naflex and ayacc, as well as new software that is expected to be made\navailable.\n\n<P>\n\n\n<H2> Availability </H2>\nAflex and Ayacc are copy-righted by the University of California, but \nsource code is available free of charge via anonymous \n<A HREF=ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/irus/> ftp. </A> \n<P>\n\n\n<HR>\n<H2> Registration Form </H2>\n---------------- cut here ------------------<br>\nIRUS software user registration form<br>\n<br>\n1.
