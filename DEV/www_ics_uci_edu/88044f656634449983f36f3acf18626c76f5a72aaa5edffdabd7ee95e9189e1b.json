Chen, Ovidiu Daescu, Xiaobo (Sharon) Hu, and Jinhui Xu\n<br>\nPresented by Michael Shindler\n</h2>\n<p>\nAbstract: \n   It is well known that any algorithm to compute the shortest path  \n   between any two vertices in a graph must take the same asymptotic time\n   as an algorithm that computers a single-source all-destinations tree.\n   But space complexity is another matter.\n   The authors develop an algorithm paradigm for reporting an optimal\n   path between two vertices without growing an entire single-source\n   all-destinations tree. This brings forth a new technique, prune and\n   search, and a new data structure, the clipped tree.\n   These are used to improve the space bounds on previously best known\n   algorithms.\n   <p>\n   This paper appeared in <i>Journal of Algorithms</i>\n   <b>49</b>:1 (October 2003), pp.&nbsp;13-41.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
