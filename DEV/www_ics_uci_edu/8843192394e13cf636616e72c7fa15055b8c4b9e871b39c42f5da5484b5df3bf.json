Special emphasis on the need for and use of teamwork, careful\rplanning, and other techniques for working with large systems.  \r</blockquote>\r\r<p>This course will emphasize techniques and notations essential to creating\rsoftware systems based on the principles discussed in ICS 121: well-understood\rrequirements, usability and user interface design, architectural design\rand module specification, well-planned testing, effective oral and written\rcommunication of concepts, proper programming style, group coordination,\rproduct documentation and software process.\r\r<p>Attendance at all lectures is mandatory. In general, there will not be much\r  lecturing in the class. Instead, class\rtime will be highly interactive, and all students are expected to participate.\r<h3>\rPrerequisites:</h3>  \r<p>ICS 51 with a grade of C or better;  ICS 121 and 141;\rMathematics 2A-B and 67. </p>\r<p>Editorial note: What 2A-B and 67 have to do with this class is beyond me!</p>\r<h3>  Is the Discussion Section required? </h3>\r\r<p>\rYes!  The discussion section is essential for two reasons:\r<ol>\r<li>  You will need to meet with your teammates REGULARLY.  The best correlation\r  with failure that I've seen in this class over the past decade has been teams\r  which were unable or unwilling\rto establish a regular meeting schedule and to keep to it.  In other words, EVERYONE\r  needs to be  in attendance at team meetings. The discussion section time period\r  is the guaranteed time period\rfor your team to meet.\r</li>\r<li>\rSince this is a large class and  each team will be making  presentations\r  during the quarter, we'll have to use some of the discussion sections for those\r  presentations.\r</li>\r</ol>\r\r<h3>  What will the projects be? </h3>\r\r<p>\rCandidate projects can come from many places:  in prior years some ICS 125\rteams worked on projects that sponsoring local companies suggested.\rOther teams worked on projects related to on-going research programs in\rthe ICS department.  Other projects may come from the students.\r\rChoice of projects is related to many goals.\r\rOne key goal is to pick a project of appropriate size.  It must be big\renough to challenge a team of four students, but not so big as to\rcommandeer everyone's life!  As a result we will spend some time at the\rbeginning of the fall attempting to size various projects.  These\rplanning estimates will be revisited as the course progresses.\r\rAnother goal is to select a variety of projects for the class.   Since\reach team will be making regular project presentations to the rest of\rthe class, diversity of projects will enable students to learn from\rexperiences across a range of project topics.\r\rStill another goal is to work on something fun and interesting!  I've\rhad students working on flight simulators, generating HTML pages,\rlinking MPEG movie frames via hypertext to other artifacts, and\rbuilding graphical program editors. <a href=\"ProjectOpportunities.html\">Here\rare this quarter's opportunities</a>.\r<h3>  How will teams be composed? </h3>\r\rEach team will have 4 or 5 people.  I will attempt to balance a team's\raggregate expertise with the needs of a particular project.  I\rwill also attempt to accommodate some personal preferences for teammates.\rThe <a href=\"survey.html\">course survey form</a>, which\ryou will turn in on the first day of class, is\ra key instrument in assigning the teams.\rIn the end however, I make all the assignments, both of team composition and\rof project.\r<H3> What's the Drop/Add policy?</H3>\r\r<p>\rSince ICS 125 has a strong team project orientation, it is essential\rthat the drop/add process be terminated early.  Therefore <em> <font size=\"+1\">NO drops\ror adds </font></em><font size=\"+1\"> of ICS 125 will be permitted after the end of the <strong>FIRST</strong>week of class.\r</font><hr>\r<h1> Lecture Topics </h1>\r\r<p>\rICS 125 is on a tight time schedule, thus there is not much time for review.\rYou are expected to recall the material covered in ICS 121 and the other\rprerequisite courses.\rShort supplementary lectures may be given on:\r<ul>\r\t<li> Teamwork and team organizations\r\t<li> Project management\r\t<li> Project cost and schedule estimation\r\t<li> Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping\r\t<li> Software architectural choice\r\t<li> Configuration management and version control\r\t<li> Distributed software engineering\r\t<li> Engineering of distributed applications, including distributed object technology\r</ul>\rSpecific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projects\rchosen by the teams.  If several of the projects, for example, are\rconcerned with Internet applications, then lectures on protocols and\rWeb technologies will be included.  \r<HR>\r<a name=\"textbooks\"></a>\r<H1> Textbooks </H1>\r\r<p>\rRemember reading\r<em> The Mythical Man-Month</em>? If you do, you can expect to profit from that\rexperience in this class. If you don't, you need to read it, cover to cover BEFORE\rthe class begins. Don't worry, it is a quick and fun read..\r\rDepending\ron\rthe\rprojects\rchosen\radditional\rreadings from various sources may be required.\r\r<ul>\r<li> REQUIRED (from earlier classes):\r\r  <ul>\r<li>\rAuthor:              Fred Brooks\r<li>\rTitle:               The Mythical Man-Month, Anniversary Edition\r<p>\r    Note that this book has a lot of white space and blank pages, so it \r    really will not take you long to read these chapters.\r</ul>\r\r<li>\rBACKGROUND/GENERAL REFERENCES:</li>\r\r<ul>\r<li>\rStephen Schach. <i>Classical and Object-Oriented Software Engineering</i>\r(Third Edition).

It will account for <strong>approximately</strong> 80% of your\rgrade; this is broken down between deliverables, a team Web page, and presentations.\rThe\r<strong>approximately</strong> remaining 20% will be divided among individual\rcourse logs, teamwork,\rindividual leadership demonstrated, and the final.\rThese are guidelines intended to help students plan their work in this course.\rHowever, the instructor does reserve the<br>\rright to make changes in these evaluation criteria.A critcal aspect of success,\rhowever,\rand thus of assessment, is an effectively functioning team. Just because a team's\rcode &quot;works&quot; at the end of the quarter does not mean that they have\rearned an A. If the team did a poor job on the requirements and design, for instance,\rtheir grade would be lower, despite &quot;working&quot; code. Put another way, if your\rteam has to pull an all-nighter to get a working system, in all likelihood\ryou will not receive the grade you want. \r<h2>\rDeliverables</h2>\rThe ICS 125 project nominally consists of five major assignments. The\rrelative weighting of each deliverable, intended to provide you with some guidance\ras to how much effort should be devoted to these tasks, \rand how much importance I ascribe to them, is indicated in the table below along\rwith\rthe\rdue\rdate, or approximate due date. The on-line versions of the assignments may still\rbe\runder\rconstruction\r(watch\rthe\r&quot;what's\rnew&quot;\rsection to see when they are available).\r<br>\r&nbsp;\r\r<br>&nbsp;\r<center><table BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 >\r<tr ALIGN=LEFT>\r\r<td><b>Deliverable/Schedule Item</b></td>\r<td><b>Weight&nbsp;</b></td>\r<td bgcolor=\"#FFFF00\"><b>Description NOTE: the URLs below are currently to the assignments from\r    PREVIOUS quarters and are hence subject to revision. </b></td>\r<td><b>Due Date (subject to change) </b></td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td><div align=\"left\">Individual Web Page</div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>For an example see <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Emdiallo/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mdiallo/</a> or\r  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Eshendric/\">Scott Hendrickson</a></td>\r<td> October 1st </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td>\r  <div align=\"left\">\r    <ul>\r      Teams Designated\r    </ul>\r  </div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td> September 30th </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td>\r  <div align=\"left\">\r    <ul>\r      Projects Selected/Assigned\r    </ul>\r  </div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td> September 30th (tentative) </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td><div align=\"left\">Team Web Page</div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>For an example </td>\r<td> October 7th</td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td><div align=\"left\">Prospectus and Plan&nbsp;</div></td>\r<td>\r<center>10&nbsp;</center>\r</td>\r<td><a href=\"prospectus.html\">Prospectus&nbsp;</a></td>\r<td> October 8th</td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td>\r  <div align=\"left\">\r    <ul>\r      Prospectus Reviews\r    </ul>\r  </div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>week 3</td>\r<td>&nbsp; </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td><div align=\"left\">Requirements Specification</div></td>\r<td>\r<center>15&nbsp;</center>\r</td>\r<td><a href=\"requirements.html\">Requirements</a></td>\r<td> October 19 </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td>\r  <div align=\"left\">\r    <ul>\r      Requirements Reviews\r    </ul>\r  </div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>week 4</td>\r<td>&nbsp; </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td><div align=\"left\">Architecture/Module Specifications&nbsp;</div></td>\r<td>\r<center>20&nbsp;</center>\r</td>\r<td><a href=\"design.html\">Architecture/Design</a></td>\r<td> November 2 </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td>\r  <div align=\"left\">\r    <ul>\r      Design Reviews\r    </ul>\r  </div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>Starting on 11/3</td>\r<td>&nbsp; </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td><div align=\"left\">Implementation&nbsp;</div></td>\r<td>\r<center>20&nbsp;</center>\r</td>\r<td><a href=\"implementation.html\">Implementation/1st demonstration </a></td>\r<td> November 22</td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td>\r  <div align=\"left\">\r    <ul>\r      Code Reviews/Demos\r    </ul>\r  </div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>week 9</td>\r<td>&nbsp; </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td><div align=\"left\">Testing/Test Documentation</div></td>\r<td>\r  <div align=\"center\">15&nbsp;</div></td>\r<td><a href=\"integration-test.html\">Implementation/2nd demonstration/Quality\r    Assurance Report </a></td>\r<td> December 2 </td>\r</tr>\r\r<tr>\r<td>\r  <div align=\"left\">\r    <ul>\r      Demonstrations\r    </ul>\r  </div></td>\r<td>.</td>\r<td>week 10 + finals week (TBD) </td>\r<td>&nbsp; </td>\r</tr>\r</table>\r</center>\r\r<p>\r Variations on this schedule may\rbe made to accommodate the particular needs of a given project or a given\rteam. Also, note that a team's grade for a phase is a function not only of the\r    document/specification developed but also\rof any associated  test plan  and any reviews\r   conducted in\rclass, with the instructor, or with the customer.\r<p>Have questions about your intellectual property rights (IPR)? Take a look\r  at the <a href=\"http://www.rgs.uci.edu/uirt/fhchiv.htm#B.%20%20Intellectual\">UC's\rview of the subject</a>.\r<h3>\rDeliverable Due Dates</h3>\r<p>\rSpecific due dates/times will be indicated for each assignment.\rNO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.\rThis applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.\rSince you are working in this class\ras part of team, it is the <strong>team's</strong> responsibility to ensure that\rassignments are turned in on time. Normal excuses for late assignments, such\ras\rillness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone on the\rteam is ill  :-)\r\r<h3>\rDeliverable Reviews</h3>\rEach deliverable will be reviewed, some reviews will be conducted before the\rwhole class.\r<p>\rYour customer should be invited to your team's Prospectus and Requirements review\ras well as your demonstration (and, possibly even your design and code\rreviews depending on the nature of your customer).&nbsp; The review is\ryour team's chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas from\rall relevant parties; your document will be reviewed at this time by course\rstaff and clients as well as the rest of the class.&nbsp; This review is\rformal, however, and each team should have presented and negotiated\rboth relevant documents to the customer prior to the review (if you haven't,\rit may be unpleasantly obvious by the interactions at this time).\r\r<h3> Document Requirements</h3>\r<P>\rAll the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral\rparts of systematic software development.  Their continued, up-to-date\rexistence is necessary for successful system development.\r<b>Do not delete</b> documents after they have been turned in.  They must\rreside permanently on your team's website, or alternatively, in a subversion\rrepository (details to be announced).\r\r<P>\rAll deliverable documents, with the exception of performance appraisals as discussed\r  below, must be prepared on-line and be available as part of your project home\r  page either as either\r  HTML or  .pdf  files.  NO MS  Word  files.\r  \rIn general, the following should be observed.\r<DL>\r  <dl>\r    <dt><strong>Cover \"page\".</strong></dt>\r  </dl>\r  <dd> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving:\r  </dd>\r</dl>\r\r\r\r<DL>\r  <DL>\r    <DT><DD> Project title\r    <DT><DD> Development phase and deliverable\r    <DT><DD> Date\r    <DT><DD> Team name/number\r    <DT><DD> Team members\r    <DT><DD> Phase manager\r    <DT><DD> Phase clerical person\r    <DT><DD> Files and locations (href's)\r  </DL>\r  <br>\r  <dl>\r    <DT>\r      <strong>Table of Contents.\r      </strong>\r    <DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents\r    <DT><strong>Specification</strong>.\r    <DD> The system specification (requirements, design,\r    module specs, code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and\r    content to the outline provided for that phase.\r    Sections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked\r    ``N/A''.\r    <DT><strong>Agendas and Minutes.\r    </strong>\r    <DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by agendas for and minutes of\r    team meetings held during the associated period of time. In contrast to previous\r      years much more &quot;grade weight&quot; will be assigned to this part of your\r      deliverables. Details on this will be given in class. \r    <DT><strong>Performance Appraisals</strong>.\r    <DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied\r    by <a href=\"Perf_Appraisal.doc\">performance appraisals</a>.  Performance appraisals shall NOT be maintained\r    as part of the project's web page.  \r    <DT><strong>Project WebPage</strong>.\r    <DD> The project deliverables, except for the performance appraisals,  shall be maintained\r    in a project homepage.  \r  </DL>\r</dl>\r<h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3>\r<P>\rFor all deliverables, except for the last and except for the &quot;Agendas and Minutes&quot;\r  section, you will also have the opportunity to ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.\r  You may hand in an improved version of a deliverable one week after that deliverable\r  has been graded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initial\rversion.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to\ruse the techniques and so that you do not implement something from a\rbad design or specification.  You should keep the\rsame responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign new\rresponsibilities for the next phase.\r\r\r<H3> Course Log</H3>\r<P>\rDuring your career you will need to keep track of how you spend your time\reither for you employer or to improve your own productivity.\rThroughout this course, you will practice doing this by keeping a\rcourse log recording the time you spend on all activities related to\rthis course.  At the beginning of each week you must submit the previous week's\r  log to the TA. A sheet showing what should be on the log <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Etaylor/ics125_fq99//logform.html\">is\ravailable</a>.\r<p>\rKeep a copy of your logs:  you will need them at the end of the quarter for the final\rreview.  \r\r<P>\rEach entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry,\rand text describing the entry.  An entry is one of three types:\r<UL><LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;\r<LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;\r<LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.\r</UL>\r\r<p>\rMost entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should\rreflect and think about what is going on.\rThe time entry applies for descriptions of activities and records the\ramount of time spent in hours, to the nearest quarter hour.\r\r<P>\rYou will be marked down only for failing to submit logs each week,\rgiving too little detail, or failing to keep track of time spent.  \r\r<P>\rYou are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors\ryou make and the amount of time they consume.  The purpose of recording\rthese errors is so that you develop a better understanding of the\rkinds of mistakes you typically make.  With that understanding you\rcan improve your performance in the future, by paying extra attention\rto those areas in which you've had problems in the past.\r<h2><font color=\"#990000\">Summary of what you turn in, and when:</font></h2>\r<ol>\r  <li><font color=\"#990000\">Weekly, by individual, using a dropbox: course log\r      for preceding week.</font></li>\r  <li><font color=\"#990000\">Per deliverable, by team, on website: deliverable documents.</font></li>\r  <li><font color=\"#990000\">Per deliverable, by team, on paper, performance appraisals.

This is particularly true when\ryou don't get to choose all your teammates (the situation here).  Many\rfactors dictate the use of a multi-person project for this course.\rYou will not, after all, be able to choose your workmates in the\rfuture.  One thing we'll discuss in the class is how to fix dysfunctional teams.\rNonetheless,\rto\ralleviate\ryour\rconcerns\rand\rto\rgrade\ryou\rappropriately, at the end of the term project you will be asked to\rdivide 100 points among the members of your project team,\rexcluding yourself, corresponding to how you believe they contributed to the\rproject as a whole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish). In addition, each\rteam member will be appraised for each phase.  This ``peer\rapportionment of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate\rindividual grades for the project component.\r\r<H3> Team Organization</H3>\r<P>\rThere are several obvious dangers to group work that can be circumvented.\rEnsure that there is adequate coordination among the team members.\rKnow each other's login names for electronic mail.\rKnow each other's phone numbers.\rMeet <b>at least twice per week</b> (outside of class lecture)\rat the same, pre-determined time each week (so as to avoid confusion).  The Discussion Section\ris designed to guarantee that such meetings are possible for everyone.  You are strongly\rurged to use that time slot.\r\r<p>\rHave a contingency plan for submitting a document on time even if\rthe responsible manager becomes unavailable.\r\r<p>\rYou are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA\rabout your progress, problems, questions, etc.\r\r<h3> Meetings</h3>\r<P>\rMeetings are an important part of a team project.\rA successful meeting requires that the meeting have a definite\rpurpose and associated agenda (these are the responsibility of the\rphase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in minutes\r(the responsibility of the phase clerical person).\r<P>\rThe purpose of minutes is to record decisions made\rand to be available for updating any team member who misses a meeting.\rEach deliverable must be accompanied by agendas and minutes\rfor the team meetings held during the associated period of time.\rI.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project web page.\rThe minutes should outline\r<OL>\r  <LI> Date, time began, time ended \r  <LI>agenda for the meeting\r  <LI> team members present and reason for any member's absence\r<LI> major design decisions discussed\r<LI> task assignments made (i.e. action items) <LI>open issues\r<LI>questions to be asked and plan for getting them answered \r<LI> future meetings scheduled\r<LI>topics for next meeting. \r</OL>\r\r\r<HR> \r<a name=\"costs\"></a>\r<H1> Cost and Benefits</H1>\r\r<p>\rThis course will demand a lot, but I think that you may well find this\rto be the most rewarding courses that you will take in your\rundergraduate career.  ICS Alumni have said repeatedly that ICS 125 was\r<em> the most important </em> class that they took at UCI.  The\rtechniques presented in class actually work and will help you in future\rsoftware development.    \r\r<p>\rAt the end of the class I encourge you to make copies of your\rproject website/notebook for each team member.  Take them with you when\ryou go to a job interview.  Students from past ICS 125 classes\rhave frequently said that it was their project notebook that \rclinched a job for them.  Some interviewers have commented that \rthe quality of the process followed by the ICS 125 teams and the\rquality of the product exceeds those of the production engineers\rin their companies.  \r\r<HR>\r<a name=\"touch\"></a>\r<H1> Keeping in Touch </H1>\rCheck the course syllabus page regularly.
