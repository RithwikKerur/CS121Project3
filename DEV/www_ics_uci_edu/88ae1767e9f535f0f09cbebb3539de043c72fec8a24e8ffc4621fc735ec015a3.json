The<a \nhref=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/Top.html\">World Wide Web</a> is a system which puts an endless \ninformation highway right at your fingertips. So you can seek out any \ninformation you want. From a variety of sources not only here at UCI, but \nalso from countries all around the world. It's possible to find information \non anything from<a \nhref=\"http://www.cis.ufl.edu/~thoth/library/recreation.html\"> \nrecreational activities</a> and travel sites to topics about \nthe<a href=\"http://ecosys.drdr.virginia.edu/Environment.html\"> \nenvironment</a>. So let the World \nWide Web be your tour guide to unknown facts and places around the world. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n   \n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>What is a Hotlist?</B></A><br>\nMy answer is... A Hotlist is an option given to you on the World Wide Web \nthat allows you to keep a list of neat things you find on the web, by saving \nthem to that list. It also let's you go back to that particular point that \nyou found interesting at any point in time. Some interesing things that I \nfound on the Web, and elected to save on my Hotlist include the<a \nhref=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/\"> \nYahoo</a> directory, The<a href=http://ea.oac.uci.edu/\">UCI Antweb</a>,<a \nhref=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Games/\">Entertainment \nand Games</a> catalog, The<a \nhref=\"http://www.nando.net/sports/bkb/1994/bkbserv.html\">Basketball \nserver</a> \n  \nfor you sport fans, and the<a href=\"http://bazaar.com/underground.html\"> \nUnderground Home Page</a>. Which I think is pretty cool. <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>What is the role of the United Nations?</B></A><br>\nMy answer is...The<a href=\"http://www.undcp.org/unlinks.html\">United \nNations</a> throughout its History has played a \nmajor role in World politics as well as the role of peacekeeper in times of \nconflict. This is a special time for the U.N. because they are also \ncelebrating their<a \nhref=\"http://www.amdahl.com/internet/events/un50.html\"> 50th \nanniversary.</a> The United Nations deals with \nmuch more than just<a href=\"http://ralph.gmu.edu/cfpa/peace/toc.html\"> peace \nkeeping missions.</a> It also deals with<a href=\"http:// \nananse.irv.uit.no/trade_law/nav/uncitral.html\"> trade \nlaws,</a> and<a href=\"http:// www.undcp.org/index.html\"> drug programs.</a> \nExploring some of these links will \ngive you a better idea of just what the U.N. does and how it works.    \n <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\nmenu\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>What are some interesting cultural facts of the African-American people?</B></A><br>\nMy answer is...Their are many interestin cultural facts about African \nAmerican people and their heritage. In searching the World Wide Web I \nfound many good starting points to better understand the<a \nhref=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/AfricanStudies/africanWWW.html\"> African American \npeople</a> and their culture. The most interesting would have to be<a \nhref=\"http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/African.American/intro.html\"> The \nLibrary of Congress.</a> Another good spot to \nstart is the<a href=\"http://www.afroam.org/afroam/\"> Afro-American Home \nPage.</a> If art is your thing there is a great exhibit in the web, that \ndeals with<a \nhref=\"http://www.lib.virginia.edu/dic/exhib/93.ray.aa/African.html\"> \nAfrican American art.</a> If you want a better \nidea of how African American students feel about race relations try<a \nhref\"=http://cowheat.student.princeton.edu/maffairs/AfroNet.html\"> \nAfro-Net.</a> <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>What are some cool facts about Whales?</B></A><br>\nMy answer is... In searchin the World Wide Web I stumbled across a section \non <a href=\"http://www.physics.helsinki.fi/whale/#USA\">whales.</a> I learned \nsome pretty cool facts and stories about different \ntypes of whales. In different areas of the World. In Hawaii they have \n<a \nhref=\"http://nearnet.gnn.com/gnn/meta/travel/features/foster/hawaii/hawaii2.html\">Whale \nwatching cruises</a> from February to March.
