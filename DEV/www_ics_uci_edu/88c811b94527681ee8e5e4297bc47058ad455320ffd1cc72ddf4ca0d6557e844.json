They wanted the capacity for\nmoving the website throughout the organization, but also maintain the same\naddress. For example, at UCI there are different names for the WWW and\nFTP server, www.ics.uci.edu and ftp.ics.uci.edu yet they point to the same\nmachine.\n<p>In 1993 NCSA chose a name for the WWW server.&nbsp; Several names were\nconsidered:\n<p>www - distinctive - no one else had this name, but it was difficult\nto pronounce.\n<br>Web - pronounceable but not unique\n<br>W3 - web project at CERN\n<p>NCSA advised people to go with www.&nbsp; Since NCSA was influential\nwith the most popular web server at the time (HTTP), everyone decided to\nfollow the www convention.\n<p><b>Walt Scacchi:</b>&nbsp; Why are Port numbers in URLs?\n<p><b>Roy Fielding:</b> The port number was decided by the naming authority\nfor web servers using TCP.&nbsp; The standard that was decided for web\nservers was 80.&nbsp; However, Roy's test server, Kiwi, is at port 8080.&nbsp;\nIt was the implementation of TCP that required the assignment of a port\nnumber.\n<p>There were problems with using TCP.&nbsp; Issues of authority restricted\nuse of web servers.\n<p><b>Walt Scacchi:</b> I understand that, but why the need for a port\nnumbering scheme?\n<p><b>Roy Fielding:</b> It's because of privilege issue and not the issue\nof having multiple servers.&nbsp; Since Roy didn't have sufficient privileges\nto his machine, he had to set up the server on a high number port.&nbsp;\nMIT students (who published the more interesting web pages) had the same\nissues and conflicted with their support personnel.\n<p><b>Daniel LaLiberte:</b> How about alternatives to URL's to URNs and\nscaling issues?\n<p><b>Roy Fielding:</b>&nbsp; I left a lot of stuff out from my talk because\nI know Larry Masinter and Michael Mealing are coming after me.\n<p><b>Daniel LaLiberte:</b>&nbsp; How about the history?\n<p><b>Roy Fielding:</b> The initial proposal by Tim Berners-Lee is a listing\nof what was implemented for the web.&nbsp; Things that are names and locations.&nbsp;\nNames continue to be valid identifier, despite location.&nbsp; Name is\nconsistent to the resource that you're referring to.\n<p>As various proposal brought to IETF, the most appropriate resource.\nSpun off URI in 1993, and that working group decided their should be a\ndistinction between names and location and syntax between the two.\n<p>The only thing that makes things persistent is the naming authority.\nSomeone who will need to last throughout eternity.&nbsp; 5 years is\n<br>typical.&nbsp; Organization that maintains these identifier - expensive\ntask is when the URI become fruitful\n<p>Scaling Issues - Larry Masinter will talk about that.\n<p>Distinguishing feature name tend to be validator\n<p>Various proposals:\n<p>IETF - identification types most appropriate URI working group formed\nin 1993 and that working group should be a distinction.&nbsp; Different\nSyntax for names and identifiers\n<p>Eternity - identifiers being persistent, 5 years for Identifier persistence\nis a very expensive task.\n<p>Put off syntax - valid if name or location same syntax\n<p><b>Bob Morgan:</b>&nbsp; U is for Universal vs. uniform? do they mean\nthe same thing?\n<p><b>Roy Fielding:</b> Way back, it was originally named \"universal\" by\nTim Berners-Lee.&nbsp; But he said that uniform means what he meant by\nuniversal.\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> Was intended to be uniform. In the IETF, the\n\"U\" is uniform.\n<p>Unique vs. universal\n<br>Everything in the IETF is uniform.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b>&nbsp; URCs were throwing everything into a bag,\nbut XML has taken over.\n<p>{ed: the notes become bit confused at this point}\n<br>History?\n<br>Listing of names\n<br>Tim Berners-Lee\n<br>Universal vs. uniform\n<br>Tml should be uniform Uri working group product\n<br>2936 - should be uniform\n<br>&nbsp;\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
