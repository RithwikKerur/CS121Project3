Avrunin in Technical Report 92-069,\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1992.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nA recent paper by Avrunin, Corbett, Dillon, and Wileden describes a method \nfor obtaining bounds on the time that can elapse between two given events \nin an execution of a concurrent software system running on a single \nprocessor under arbitrary scheduling. The technique involves generating \nlinear inequalities expressing conditions that must be satisfied by all \nexecutions of such a system and using integer programming methods to find \nappropriate solutions to the inequalities. Corbett has extended this approach \nto obtain upper bounds on the time between events in executions of \nmulti-processor concurrent systems in which each process proceeds unless \nforced to wait to communicate with another, the case of maximal parallelism, \nand processes communicate by synchronous message passing. Corbett's method \ndoes not strictly enforce the maximal parallelism assumption, however, \nand may thus give poor (though valid) bounds in some cases. In this paper, \nI show how to modify Corbett's method to obtain sharper bounds.\n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 26 13:36:42 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
