Among\nthese classes of graphs are trigraphs (triangulations in which inner \nvertices have degree >= 6), triangular systems (triangulations in\nwhich inner vertices have degree = 6), and hexagonal systems (subgraphs\nof a regular hexagonal grid, bounded by a simple circuit).  In\nthis talk, I will discuss some of their results, focusing on the \nproblem of computing the diameter.\n</p>\n<p>\nFull citation of [CDV]: Victor Chepoi, Feodor Dragan, and Yann Vax\\`es,\nCenter and Diameter problems in plane triangulations and quadrangulations,\n<i>Proceedings of the 13th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms \n(SODA 2002)</i>, San Francisco, CA, January 2002, 346-355.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
