These\r\n processes focus on the procurement of R&amp;D services, and how they can\r\nbe redesigned and supported using Web-based capabilities. Through the application\r\n of empirical results and theoretical concepts from business process reengineering,\r\n electronic commerce, and IT-based process management, we gain insight into\r\n issues and challenges to be addressed in redesigning the procurement of\r\ncontracted services with Web-based EC capabilities. Accordingly, four research\r\nquestions are identified and addressed which build from these results and\r\nconcepts. Finally, in collaboration with other participants in this effort,\r\nthe case study reveals that we could contribute to a substantial reduction\r\nin process cycle time and operational costs associated with the annual funding\r\nof thousands of research grant procurement actions at ONR.  \r\n<p><b><i><font face=\"Arial\">1. Introduction</font></i></b> </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Anecdotal evidence from recent efforts to deploy Web-enabled procurement\r\n at companies such as AMD and<b> </b>Boehringer Ingelheim Corp., indicates\r\n that such moves create \"a massive reengineering challenge\" [27, quoted in \r\nthe original]. Why is this so? Why can't organizations simply purchase and \r\ninstall an off-the-shelf software package that supports procurement functions \r\nthat use the Internet without encountering a massive reengineering challenge? \r\nIs the experience at organizations like AMD simply anomalous, or are they \r\nlikely to be typical of other organizations following a similar path? Are \r\nthe challenges any greater, lesser or just different if we address the procurement \r\nof contracted services instead of the procurement of supplies for maintenance, \r\nrepair and operations? </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The purpose of this paper is to explore four research questions that follow \r\nfrom these simple inquiries through an action research case study performed \r\nat the Office of Naval Research. The ONR study focussed on reengineering\r\nthe procurement of contracted research services. The procurement of contracted\r\n services is a topic that has not appeared in previous studies of Web-based\r\n electronic commerce [cf. 8, 9, 14, 26, 32]. As such, the first question\r\naddresses, <i>how is the procurement of contracted services in an organization\r\nlike ONR similar to, or different from, other common procurement activities.</i>\r\n  The second question examines, <i>what is involved in reengineering the\r\nprocesses for procurement of contracted services</i>. The third research\r\nquestion investigates, <i>how can information technologies for Web-based\r\nprocess management play a role in facilitating the reengineering of contracted\r\nservice procurement</i> . Finally, the fourth question identifies <i>what\r\nkinds of challenges can make the transition to Web-based procurement processes\r\nproblematic, and how can these challenges be resolved</i>. Background discussion\r\nand related research in Section 2 on business process reengineering (BPR),\r\nelectronic commerce (EC) and information technology (IT) for process management\r\ncan be used to formulate initial answers to these questions. However, developing\r\ngrounded answers to these questions requires an empirical investigation.\r\nThis is the purpose of the case study at ONR found in Section 3. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The paper describes an approach, technology, and case study for understanding,\r\n redesigning and transforming procurement processes and information work\r\nenvironment for a complex, multi-site organization. It begins with a background\r\nthat characterizes what must be understood in order to redesign and transform\r\nthe procurement of services, specifically R&amp;D services supported by contracts \r\nand grants from ONR. The next section provides an overview of related research \r\nused in the case study that follows. Through the ONR case study, six challenges \r\nfor what's involved in understanding, redesigning and transforming procurement \r\nprocesses to utilize Web-based EC capabilities are identified and addressed. \r\nA discussion of these challenges and the consequence of their resolution at\r\nONR follows. Finally, the conclusions reexamine the four research questions \r\nthat motivate this study. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Through this effort, a dramatic reduction in the cycle time by a factor\r\n of 20 was achieved, while operational cost savings worth $10M-$15M per year \r\nwere identified and mobilized. The case study thus serves to explain how these\r\nresults were accomplished by overcoming challenges in place at ONR.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b><i><font face=\"Arial\">2. Understanding service procurement and how\r\nto reengineer it</font></i></b> </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Procurement typically refers to organizational activities associated with \r\nthe purchase of raw materials and production goods, supplies for maintenance,\r\n repair and operations (MRO), as well as for capital goods. Materials, supplies\r\n and production goods are generally items that can be found and described\r\nin catalogs, then purchased in quantity units per transaction. The procurement\r\n of items like these is a focus of research and practice for how EC may be \r\napplied in organizations through Internet-based procurement processes [3, \r\n8, 9, 14, 27]. Nonetheless, many organizations also procure <i>contracted\r\n services </i>of one kind or another. Services may or may not result in the \r\ndelivery of materials, supplies or goods. Services instead may provide new, \r\nenhanced, or sustaining capabilities to an organization. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>R&amp;D service contracts (including research grants) often expend amounts\r\n between $10K-$10M per year. At ONR, the average expense for a research contract \r\nis about $100K per year. As a result, fulfillment of contracted services procurement\r\nusually takes months or years to complete. Similarly, due to the high cost,\r\ngovernance and management controls associated with service contracts of this\r\nkind, the procurement of research service is usually not a single purchase\r\ntransaction. Instead, it is a sequence of incremental procurement actions\r\nover the course of a contract. Long duration contract service procurements, \r\nsuch as a research grant, give rise to many short-term procurement actions. \r\nSubsequently, the structure and workflow of short-term service transactions \r\nin the context of a long-term fulfillment become the focus of what must be \r\nredesigned and transformed in order to utilize Internet or Web-based EC systems \r\nassociated with the procurement of contracted services. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>2.1 Understanding the procurement of contracted services</b> </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The authorization and obligation of start-up or incremental funding are \r\ncommon actions when procuring contracted services. Such actions obligate\r\nfunds and designate budget line items in the corporate treasury to be charged,\r\nwhich in turn are exposed for expenditure draws, subject to various corporate\r\naccounting policies and auditing controls. Invoices submitted by service\r\nproviders can then be paid, for instance via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).\r\nProgress payments to pay for incremental or ongoing services are made until\r\nthe funding authorization is exhausted, changed or rescinded, subject to\r\nother terms and conditions stipulated and agreed to in the contract. In order\r\nto redesign the processes for procuring services such as R&amp;D, details\r\nsuch as these point to the control logic, pre- and post-conditions (i.e.,\r\nbusiness rules) associated with different procurement process steps or workflow\r\nactions. Similarly, these details begin to identify the types of information\r\nentities that procurement participants may need to access, update or manipulate\r\nthrough an Internet-based user interface to underlying EC applications. Examples \r\nof these details are presented later. </p>\r\n \r\n<h3> 2.2 How is service procurement at ONR the same/different than other government\r\norganizations or commercial enterprises?</h3>\r\n  ONR's procurement activities are focused on the <i>acquisition of science\r\n and technology R&amp;D services. </i>It acquires these services from a few \r\nthousand academic, non-profit and for-profit institutions to support the research\r\nagenda of the U.S. Navy. The providers of research services are distributed\r\nthroughout the U.S., but a small number of providers are based in settings\r\nin Europe, Japan, and elsewhere. ONR also acts as a research funding intermediary\r\n(or \"contract manager\") for other Government agencies that do not or may\r\nnot be able to manage R&amp;D service procurements. ONR acquires research\r\nservices using contracts, grants (i.e., limited contracts), and other agreements.\r\nSubsequently, during the 1990's, ONR procured research services through grants\r\ntotaling between $500M-$2B/year via 4000-8000 procurement actions (process\r\ninstances) per year. Thus, at this point, ONR is similar to other large organizations\r\nin the amount of money spent through procurements. ONR also serves a similar\r\npurpose within the Government as other research funding agencies (NSF, HHS,\r\nDOE, NASA, etc.) focused on the acquisition of R&amp;D services. However,\r\nONR chose not to automate existing processes for grant management, in contrast\r\nto the NSF FastLane system that automated its existing research grant proposal\r\nsubmission and review process in 1996-98 (cf. http://www.fastlane.nsf.gov).\r\n \r\n<p>Acquiring R&amp;D services is big business. The acquisition of R&amp;D\r\n services represents a substantial area of procurement actions and expenditures\r\n within the U.S. Government, with total U.S. Government outlays for R&amp;D\r\n services in 1998 exceeding $70B [25]. Understanding how procurement processes\r\n at ONR may be redesigned to use Internet-based EC capabilities may shed\r\nlight on how it may be applied in similar research acquisition settings.\r\nThus, a substantial opportunity exists for exploring how Internet-based EC\r\ncan be applied to support the acquisition and procurement of R&amp;D services. \r\nHowever, things may be different in the private sector. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Few corporations, if any, acquire scientific research services from external \r\nsources at the total dollar level or total number of procurement actions compared\r\nto ONR or similar Government agencies. Nonetheless, a large portion of corporations\r\nand non-research oriented Government departments frequently acquire contracted\r\nservices of various kinds (E.g., consulting, engineering, and facilities\r\nmanagement) from external providers. These acquisitions may come in the form\r\nof service contracts, sub-contracts, or other outsourcing arrangements. Thus,\r\nthis study can help highlight issues and challenges that can arise when a\r\nlarge organization seeks to redesign its procurement processes for contracted\r\nservices to take advantage on Internet-based EC capabilities. A foundation\r\nfor these capabilities now follows. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Two areas of related research bear on this study. These are business process \r\nreengineering and EC. Each is addressed in turn, though the results cited \r\nwill be framed in terms of their application for procurement processes. Also, \r\nthe process-driven IT employed in this study is introduced and described.\r\n </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>2.3 How to reengineer business processes like procurement?</b> </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Following the work of Hammer, Davenport and their colleagues, existing\r\n as-is procurement processes should be either obliterated rather than automated\r\n [13], or else understood and measured [5]. Accordingly, innovative to-be\r\nprocurement processes should be prototyped using leading-edge IT as a new\r\nfoundation for coordinating research grants management activities [5]. However,\r\nthe ability to successfully realize the benefits of radical IT-based changes \r\nin most business processes has been elusive. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Reflective studies of the problems, pitfalls and best practices of BPR\r\n find that certain organizational variables, rather than IT, are key to achieving \r\nsuccessful BPR outcomes [1, 12]. In many of the BPR projects examined, BPR \r\nfailure was reported to be the outcome about 70% of the time [1]. How can \r\nBPR failure be avoided when redesigning procurement processes? Available research\r\nresults indicate that critical conditions to help realize successful BPR\r\nshould include the participation and commitment of top management executives, \r\nempowered workers, shared vision, realistic expectations, changes in worker \r\nroles and responsibilities, new performance measurements, worker incentives, \r\nand the like [1, 12]. Conversely if these organizational conditions are insignificant \r\nor missing, then we should expect the application of BPR to processes like \r\nprocurement to fail. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The dilemma of how to realize the benefits of a successful BPR project,\r\n while avoiding the likelihood of failure, gave rise to a series of empirical\r\n field studies and surveys to track down the source of variation and causality.\r\n Results from representative investigations [2, 6, 10] emphasized the importance\r\n of addressing BPR implementation within the broader context of organizational\r\n change in a complex socio-technical environment [cf. 17]. For instance,\r\nsome organizations may choose to reengineer a set of processes over time,\r\nin order to learn from what succeeds and what fails [2]. Applying a lesson\r\nlearned from Caron and colleagues [2] to procurement reveals that BPR efforts\r\nshould be implemented bottom-up by the process end-users, rather than imposed\r\ntop-down by senior management [cf. 13], to succeed. Following this, senior\r\nmanagement should provide the strategic vision for an effort to redesign\r\nprocesses, such as procurement, that empowers process staff to participate\r\nin directing and implementing the effort [6]. Similarly, change management\r\nstrategies and techniques, technological competence, tactical planning and\r\nproject management, and training personnel for to-be processes, should be\r\nfactors related to success when redesigning procurement processes [10]. Subsequently,\r\ndrawing from the emerging theoretical basis of BPR [15], when redesigning\r\nprocurement processes, focus should be on the creation of an organizational\r\nenvironment that supports change management strategies, learning, knowledge\r\nsharing supplemented with IT, internal and external partnering, and measurable\r\nprocess improvements, as prerequisites for BPR success. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Finally, recent studies of BPR establish ties between process change and \r\ntheir consequence on organizational performance. For example, applying the \r\nresults of Guha and colleagues [11], reengineering procurement processes\r\nshould require the creation of a learning organization where the interdependencies\r\n between the change environment, process management and change management.\r\n Following [30], when redesigning procurement processes, management controls\r\n of organizational resources, such as procurement expenditures, must remain\r\n effective though perhaps in a more streamlined manner. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>2.4 How is Electronic Commerce Research Related to Procurement Processes?</b>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Procurement has been identified as one of the key areas for the application\r\n and integration of EC tools and techniques [14]. However, the relationship\r\n seems to primarily emphasize the use of EC to support the procurement of\r\nMRO commodities, supplies or goods, rather than contracted services. How\r\nto best support contracting, contract management, and negotiation in the\r\ncontext of EC is seen as a topic for future research [24], yet procurement\r\ncontract management processes are central to this study. Emerging theory\r\non EC points to the need to understand business processes in terms of the\r\ninterdependencies of variables such as business partnering arrangements [26],\r\nnetworked IT infrastructure design [31], and transaction (governance) costs\r\n[32]. Thus, we should assume these interdependencies can arise in the context\r\nof applying EC technologies and techniques to contracted service procurement,\r\nand so they should be investigated. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>2.5 Redesigning Procurement Processes with IT for Process Management</b>\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Research results in BPR draw attention to the need to focus on change\r\nmanagement and process management. Change management draws attention to understanding \r\nand transforming work activities, the organizational setting and the ways \r\nparticipants act towards both. For process management, we choose to understand, \r\nanalyze, and engineer complex organizational processes using process-driven \r\nintranets (PDIs) supported by a knowledge-based systems approach [19, 23, \r\n28, 29]. The PDI and underlying technology developed at the USC ATRIUM Laboratory \r\nin the mid-1990's (and possibly appearing somewhat dated) are not the focus \r\nof this paper, but they are described elsewhere [23, 29]. Instead, attention \r\nis directed at the approach taken for process management, and the role the \r\nPDI played in supporting this approach. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The incremental specification and system-based interpretation of business\r\n process representations is central to this approach. Such representations\r\n can be designated as <i>organizational process architectures</i> (OPAs).\r\nAn OPA denotes a structured, software-based representation of the object,\r\nattributes, relations, methods and constraints. These representations collectively\r\ndefine and link the structure and flow of work processes within an organizational\r\n and technological context [29, 22]. Such a computational representation\r\nis more than a graphical workflow specification; it is instead an <i>ontology\r\n </i>that specifies the structure and definition of relationships between \r\nobjects denoting who does what, where, when, why and how in the course of \r\nenacting work processes. Description of the ontology is found elsewhere [19, \r\n28]. Using such an ontology, OPAs can be formalized as knowledge representations\r\n (semantic networks) that model the web of processes, products, people (roles\r\n and workgroups), information infrastructure, and tools central to an organization\r\n in its routine and ad hoc work operations [17, 19, 28, 29]. Highlights of \r\nthe activities associated with development of OPAs now follow, since their \r\ndetails appear elsewhere [28, 29]. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>In simplest terms, support for understanding and redesigning business\r\nprocesses entails the development of OPAs through knowledge-based engineering\r\nof the<i>  process life cycle</i> [28, 29]. PLC engineering is a technique\r\nfor process management [4], rather than a BPR methodology practiced by industry\r\nconsultants [16]. Process management subsumes common BPR activities such\r\nas process modeling, visualization, analysis, simulation, redesign and prototyping.\r\nOur approach to process management adds support for these capabilities across\r\nmulti-partner (virtual) enterprises and multiple settings [23]. Similarly,\r\nit adds Internet-based IT mechanisms for integrating multiple distributed\r\nprocesses, automated process-driven IT environment generation, semi-automated\r\nprocess enactment, automated enactment monitoring and history capture (plus\r\nreplay), recovery from process enactment failures, and process asset management,\r\nas part of its life cycle [23, 28, 29]. None of these capabilities are specific\r\nto procurement processes, and thus these capabilities can be used to support\r\nany organizational process whose OPA can be formally modeled following our\r\napproach. However, these capabilities provide an Internet-based IT infrastructure\r\nto rapidly configure, prototype and instantiate a PDI that can serve as a\r\n<i>collaboratory for process reengineering </i>[cf. 18]. Such a PDI provided\r\na computer-supported learning environment where personnel from multiple ONR\r\nsites could share and participate off-/on-site with USC researchers to incrementally\r\nelicit, visualize, prototype, refine and integrate organizational processes,\r\nusing tools and OPAs accessed over the Internet [22, 23, 28, 29]. These were\r\nnew capabilities previously not used in BPR projects (in 1996-97), though\r\nthey have been used in other domains [19, 22, 29]. Furthermore, existing\r\ntools for redesigning or implementing procurement processes generally lack\r\nthese capabilities [cf. 3, 5, 14, 27]. Subsequently, our choice was to use\r\nthis approach to process management to support the BPR of contracted procurement \r\nprocesses by a research team partnered with process end-users. </p>\r\n \r\n<h2> <i><font face=\"Arial\">3. Case Study: Reengineering research service procurement\r\nat ONR</font></i></h2>\r\n  ONR conducts its commerce through thousands of procurement actions per\r\nyear. These provide initial or incremental funding to pay for the salaries,\r\nexpenses and other costs incurred by the research service providers. In return,\r\nONR receives products from the research projects it funds in the form of\r\ntechnical reports, research publications, system prototypes, presentation\r\nbriefings, and so forth.  \r\n<p>In this case study, the BPR focus was directed at the set of four processes\r\n of ONR's research acquisition activity:<i> Pre-Award</i> (proposal solicitation\r\n [20] and review), <i>Award</i> (funding decision and obligation), <i>Administration</i>\r\n  (funds disbursement and field office operations), and <i>Close-out</i>\r\n(funding completion, reconciliation, and reporting compliance). These four\r\ninterrelated processes consisted of about 150 as-is process steps (i.e.,\r\nproblem-solving tasks) at ONR, representing up to four levels of process\r\ndecomposition and supervision. Five regional offices support ONR across the\r\nU.S. to facilitate or perform these processes. Thus inputs, outputs or refinements\r\nto/from the activities involved in the reengineering effort had to be accessible\r\nin locations across the U.S. The choice made was to utilize a collaborative\r\nInternet-based information infrastructure for process redesign developed\r\nto address this need [29]. Accordingly, collective effort was focused on\r\nlearning and demonstrating how process life cycle activities could access,\r\nsupport, and deliver procurement processes at ONR offices over the Internet\r\nusing a PDI and EC service transactions. Examples will be highlighted along\r\nthe way. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>As part of this study, ONR wanted to adopt a corporate-wide intranet to \r\nsupport its internal processes throughout its offices associated with funding \r\nand tracking of research contracts and grants. This intranet was envisioned \r\nby senior management at ONR to eventually use EC tools and techniques, in \r\nline with emerging Government EC initiatives [7]. Senior management's long-term \r\ngoal at ONR was to evolve this intranet to integrate and support EDI for research\r\ngrant paperwork submissions, EFT for funds distribution, and various information\r\nrepositories to organize, broker, track, evaluate, and report on funded R&amp;D\r\nproject activities. Nonetheless, the existing IT-based systems at ONR operated\r\nmainly as independent systems. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>3.1 Challenges in redesigning ONR procurement processes for Internet-based\r\n EC</b> </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Understanding and modeling the situation at hand was the first goal [5]. \r\nThrough a series of meetings and initial process elicitation, we came to discover\r\na number of challenging problems had to be addressed in redesigning  ONR's\r\nacquisition processes to eventually accommodate a multi-site corporate  intranet.\r\nSix such problems became apparent: </p>\r\n \r\n<p><i>Personnel at ONR were unfamiliar with the concepts, techniques, and\r\n tools for understanding and redesigning their work processes</i>. This seems \r\ntrue of organizations that have not undertaken a process redesign effort [1].\r\nThus, we could not expect that ONR personnel could readily describe or articulate\r\nhigh fidelity specifications of their work processes and arrangements, though\r\nthey work within them on a daily basis. Most of their knowledge of these\r\nroutine processes had become tacit. Thus we and they had to collectively educate\r\nand share with each other how these processes operate, the operational problems\r\narising during these processes, and how these processes might be changed\r\nand streamlined [15]. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><i>ONR had a heterogeneous computing infrastructure and isolated information\r\n systems that often made information sharing problematic. </i>ONR possessed\r\n the basic compliment of Internet-based systems and infrastructure needed\r\nto conduct EC. These systems included TCP/IP LANs with Internet connectivity,\r\n secure web server and web browsers installed on desktop PCs. ONR also employed\r\n a database system for managing procurement actions, a second database system\r\n used by field offices for contract and grant administration, and a third\r\ndatabase system outside of ONR under the control of the U.S. Dept. of Defense\r\nComptroller for tracking ONR's expended funds. In addition, ONR employs an\r\nexperimental EDI testbed, and various data analysis and management reporting\r\nutilities. However, all these capabilities existed as distinct stand-alone\r\nsystems. ONR stipulated that these legacy systems could not be thrown out\r\nor bypassed. Instead, they must be incorporated into proposed redesign alternatives.\r\nImplementing an intranet thus would require bridging and integrating these\r\nheterogeneous \"islands of automation\" [22]. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><i>There was recurring difficulty in efficiently managing and tracking\r\n research grants funding expenditures</i>. The management of contract service\r\n expenditures was not a routine everyday activity at ONR, compared to the\r\nfour research acquisition processes. Instead, it was an ad hoc, on-demand\r\nprocess to gather, summarize and report data on the status of overall procurement\r\n funds from different financial databases accessed or maintained by ONR.\r\nDemand for expenditure management updates could be triggered by programmatic\r\nchanges in budget authorization or unexpected budget shortfalls/surpluses.\r\nHowever, relevant data was located in different information systems or personal\r\ninformation spaces. Elements of this information were said to be inconsistent,\r\ndepending on whose \"numbers\" staff could access and when. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><i>There was a lack of trust and lack of data integrity controls in existing \r\ndata sets</i>. This gave rise to problems higher up in the organization since \r\ndecision-makers need timely access to current budget totals for procurement\r\n funds obligated, encumbered, and expended across different categories and\r\n research programs [cf. 30]. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><i>There was limited visibility and slow response to external customer\r\n inquiries (from outside agencies using ONR research grants management services)\r\n on the status of pending funding actions for research proposal grants to\r\nbe awarded.</i> Untimely delays or inconsistent data could lead to loss of\r\nobligation authority for funding contract procurements inside ONR or its\r\nfunding partners (e.g., DARPA), due to Federal budgeting process constraints\r\nand DoD financial controls. These constraints and controls had to be maintained,\r\nwhile conformance to them needed to be streamlined [cf. 30]. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><i>Can all of the five preceding challenges be concurrently address via \r\nan approach to process management that incorporates organizational transformation, \r\nprocess redesign and Internet-based systems integration</i>? The basic issue \r\nhere is to avoid development of an ad hoc, piece-meal, or point solution to\r\neach of the preceding challenges, and instead pursue a collaborative, comprehensive\r\nand integrated solution. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Subsequently, this set of challenges suggests that redesigning research\r\n service procurement at ONR would be a major undertaking [cf. 27]. </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>3.2 Addressing the challenges</b> </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The USC research team came to the view that the preceding problems were\r\n interrelated. Thus, the solutions to these problems should also be related.\r\n For example, data integrity problems were assigned a top priority by ONR\r\nsenior management for action. Subsequently, process redesign would need to\r\nprovide upstream data quality checks to minimize the likelihood of getting\r\ninconsistent data into the systems [12, 30]. One goal of process redesign\r\nwould need to address how to make sure that people who were most interested\r\nin getting correct data input to a process were enabled and self-motivated\r\nto do so. For instance, the principal investigator or institution that submits\r\na research proposal to ONR should be capable and well-motivated to correctly\r\nenter data pertaining to their proposed budget, schedule of deliverables,\r\nand surface or electronic mail addresses for receiving payments. However,\r\nthis was a to-be vision. In the as-is condition, different ONR staff would\r\nre-enter such data in various procurement steps, in different organizational\r\nlocations, in different formats into different information systems. This\r\nadds no value to the data, but instead increases the likelihood of error,\r\ndata inconsistency, process workarounds, and subsequent processing delays.\r\nProviding Web-based input forms and corresponding ONR server-side database\r\nentry routines could support such a redesign [5, 13]. This in turn could\r\neliminate some of the existing as-is process pathologies that compromise\r\ndata integrity. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Subsequently, the process redesign team found the other challenges could\r\n be resolved through a series of solution steps that bring people, processes,\r\n work products, and extant information system technologies into alignment.\r\n A description of these steps now follows. </p>\r\n \r\n<h4> <i>Step 1: Facilitate collaborative understanding, redesign and transformation\r\n of ONR processes.</i></h4>\r\n  Procurement is traditionally viewed as a back office business activity\r\nconcerned with purchasing, corporate financial operations, expenditure management, \r\nand status reporting [7, 8, 14]. At ONR, it is also an activity governed by\r\na large number of changing acquisition regulations and policies at Federal, \r\nDoD, and Navy levels. Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs) apply to all \r\ngovernment agencies, including those involved in procuring R&amp;D services \r\nthrough contracts and grants. Conditions and constraints stipulated in the \r\nFARs ultimately prescribed how different kinds of procurement actions will \r\nbe processed. Nonetheless, the processes and artifacts used to manage development \r\ncontracts are essentially the same as those used to manage research grants. \r\nIn addition, the ONR personnel who administer grant awards from ONR's five \r\nfield offices across the U.S. are the same people who manage contract fulfillment \r\nobligations, as well as FAR compliance and reporting requirements at institutions \r\nreceiving research funding. Thus, the domain of acquisition and procurement \r\nof research service contracts for Federal agencies is highly tractable and \r\nsufficiently structured to enable successful understanding of the as-is and \r\nto-be OPA [5].  \r\n<p>Procurement organizations are populated with personnel that are usually\r\n not specialists with advanced information technology. They cannot be expected\r\n to already be familiar with a wide range of intranet tools or EC concepts.\r\n This was true at ONR. Furthermore, they might resist the intervention by\r\n\"outsiders\" whose purpose may be perceived as eliminating their jobs or reducing\r\ntheir administrative autonomy through a process redesign effort [cf. 1, 2].\r\nNonetheless, ONR like other government agencies is under substantial pressure\r\nto accept increasing workloads, improve organizational efficiency and effectiveness, \r\nand reduce operational costs, all within shrinking operating budgets. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Understanding the as-is and to-be OPA of research procurement processes\r\n at ONR benefited from the involvement, participation, and intellectual engagement \r\nof personnel from the top to the bottom of the ONR organization [1, 15]. The\r\nUSC researchers needed to educate ONR personnel on our motives, methods and\r\ncapabilities; ONR needed to help us learn about the generic, circumstantial, \r\nand problematic variants of their work processes and information flow [10, \r\n11]. Two or three iterations of process elicitation, analysis, visualization \r\nand redesign refinements were typically performed, particularly with key process\r\nend-users, process owners or subject-matter experts. Follow-up validations \r\nand refinements by other personnel not necessarily involved in earlier iterations \r\nwere also performed. Furthermore, a shared vision and constraints were established \r\nearly on between the research team and ONR personnel covering the following \r\nitems [cf. 1, 6, 10, 15]: </p>\r\n \r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> the USC research team would identify opportunities for optimizing\r\nthe redesign of work processes, information flow and information integration \r\n(see Table 1 for examples);</li>\r\n   <li> effort would be directed at improving personnel effectiveness and \r\nworkflow without increasing anyone's workload--personnel had to be more satisfied\r\n with the new redesigned work arrangements than with the status quo;</li>\r\n   <li> no new personnel positions would be created or added, but responsibilities\r\n could change;</li>\r\n   <li> four ONR acquisition processes examined would be developed in three \r\nforms: as-is (legacy form), to-be (alternative process architecture), and \r\nhere-to-there transition forms (steps taken in 30 day increments to progressively \r\ntransform the organizational work patterns and processes from the as-is to \r\nto-be forms--see Table 2 for examples).</li>\r\n   <li> all intermediate and in-progress results would be posted on the USC \r\nATRIUM web site, so ONR personnel could access this information over the Web\r\nat their discretion, and provide questions or feedback via email, telephone\r\n or face-to-face meetings;</li>\r\n   <li> ONR personnel would make final decisions on the selection, prioritization\r\n and schedule of process redesign alternatives to be implemented;</li>\r\n   <li> any process improvements to be implemented had to be self-motivating \r\nor enable local organizational incentives to increase the likelihood of their\r\n successful implementation and routinization.</li>\r\n   \r\n</ul>\r\n  Because of these efforts and shared agreements, there was little or no\r\nresistance among the participating staff. Instead, participants indicated\r\nthey felt empowered and intellectually engaged in the organizational transformation.\r\n The overall process redesign effort was defined and structured as inherently\r\n collaborative in purpose, method, and outcome. Subsequently, the commitments\r\n and actions of ONR's participants to transform and sustain their OPAs would\r\n determine the ultimate success of this process redesign effort.  \r\n<p>One key aspect of the collaborative strategy for redesigning procurement\r\n processes at ONR was the ability to identify multiple alternatives for how \r\nthe process structure or flow could be streamlined. Accordingly, the USC researchers\r\nidentified ten possible process redesign options that could be applied in\r\ndifferent parts of the procurement process at ONR. Table 1 presents these\r\nin the following manner. The first column identifies the \"process diagnostics\" \r\nthat characterize some part of the as-is procurement processes at ONR, derived \r\nfrom measurements on the OPA [27]. The second column identifies the corresponding \r\nredesign opportunities [12] or \"process redesign heuristics\" [29] that seek \r\nto resolve the problems associated with a process diagnostic [20, 21]. The \r\nfinal column represents a collective, subjective assessment by the USC and \r\nONR process redesign team for the expected return on investment if ONR were \r\nto provide the resources required to successfully implement the corresponding \r\nredesign heuristic. No robust cost analysis or attendant effort to collect \r\ncost data was performed. Nonetheless, ONR decision-makers were comfortable \r\nwith such an assessment, given the openness of the process redesign and assessment \r\nactivity, discussion and perceived outcomes [1]. </p>\r\n

redesign\r\n alternatives exist, but with varying perceived returns. Most of the redesign\r\n heuristics point to a new information infrastructure for procurement that\r\n manages new or existing information entities with new/legacy tools or process\r\n automation capabilities that could be integrated with Internet-based technologies.\r\n But to do so would require making many changes in how procurement processes\r\n work at ONR. The USC researchers were responsible for proposing process\r\nredesigns, then prototyping and demonstrating the resulting information infrastructure \r\nfor the redesigned procurement processes. These results could be turned over \r\nto one or more commercial IT service contractors ONR uses for final implementation \r\nand ongoing production support. ONR personnel were then responsible for choosing \r\nwhich process redesigns to pursue, resource and implement. In the end, ONR \r\npersonnel selected all but one of the redesign alternatives, with the exception \r\nbeing the rule-based contract document builder. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>ONR needed to implement the proposed changes from the as-is to to-be forms \r\nof the procurement processes and information infrastructure. The process redesign\r\nteam in conjunction with many others at ONR then developed and refined a\r\nhere-to-there transition plan which relevant ONR personnel had to approve \r\nand commit the necessary resources. Table 2 provides a sample from the 25 \r\ntransition steps that characterize the priority and level of resources/effort \r\nneeded to incrementally make the requisite transitions from as-is to to-be \r\nprocurement processes. <br>\r\n &nbsp; </p>\r\n \r\n<center> \r\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"7\" width=\"588\">\r\n  <tbody>\r\n     <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"51%\">        \r\n      <center><font size=\"-1\">Update R&amp;D proposal submission guidelines \r\non ONR Web site&nbsp;</font></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"49%\">        \r\n      <center><font size=\"-1\">Less than 30 days</font></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"51%\">        \r\n      <center><font size=\"-1\">Automate proposal received notification in relevant\r\nONR divisions</font></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"49%\">        \r\n      <center><font size=\"-1\">60 days</font></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"51%\">        \r\n      <center><font size=\"-1\">Automate routing of procurement action requests \r\nto appropriate ONR grant specialists</font></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"49%\">        \r\n      <center><font size=\"-1\">90 days</font></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"51%\">        \r\n      <center><font size=\"-1\">Automate the distribution of all proposal grant \r\npackage information and records within ONR</font></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"49%\">        \r\n      <center><font size=\"-1\">Greater than 90 days (but less than 6 months)</font></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n     \r\n  </tbody> \r\n</table>\r\n </center>\r\n    \r\n<center>  \r\n<p><a name=\"Table2\"></a><b><font size=\"-1\">Table 2</font>.

The corresponding priority and schedule for implementation\r\n appear in the right column. Selected results from transformations such as \r\nthese are described below, as well as in related papers [23, 29]. </p>\r\n \r\n<h4> <i>Step 2: Iteratively prototype, demonstrate and refine a PDI for ONR\r\n procurement processes.</i></h4>\r\n  The development and technology of PDIs are not the focus of this paper.\r\nBut what is important to know about PDIs is that they can be used to collaboratively\r\n and incrementally specify, visualize, prototype and automate the enactment\r\n of complex business processes with Web-based mechanisms, using an OPA as\r\ninput. The OPA can be specified incrementally, or as you proceed, in a process\r\nmodeling language which serves as input to a PDI compiler that instantiates\r\na distributed process enactment web [23, 29]. This means that the USC researchers\r\ncould represent and model as-is and to-be procurement processes that were\r\nbeing iteratively investigated and refined by ONR personnel. Following each\r\niteration, a Web-based prototype that provides authorized users navigational\r\nviews of their work processes through a Web browser would be generated, together\r\nwith links to associated applications and data. The following figures provide \r\na brief glimpse of user interface displays from the PDI designed and generated \r\nby USC researchers for ONR procurement processes. By themselves, these displays \r\nmay convey little of the procurement processes, since the total set of process \r\nsteps in the four redesigned processes now numbers in the dozens (from about \r\n150 to less than 40). However, most users of these processes only see a small \r\nsubset of the steps and corresponding user interfaces specified for their \r\nuser-role (contract administrator, grants specialist, program officer, research \r\ninvestigator, etc.).  \r\n<p>Figure 1 shows one example step (in a then current Netscape 1.2 browser\r\n window in 1996) within procurement processes at ONR. This step is part of \r\nthe Pre-Award process, whereby a research investigator (a user role) submits \r\na proposal to ONR for funding consideration. As part of this step, the investigator \r\nenters data needed by ONR for logging and tracking subsequent actions pertaining \r\nto the submitted proposal. This includes identifying the proposal file to \r\nbe submitted for upload or transfer to ONR. When the user satisfactorily enters\r\nthe requested data, the transfer is initiated by selecting the \"Done\" button.\r\nAfter this, the user can then select the \"Next Task\" from a list of those\r\nready to be performed. Although not shown, it is a similar step whereby the\r\ninvestigator submits an electronic budget form that accompanies the proposal\r\nsubmission. Finally, the frame in the bottom right that displays the history\r\nof steps done as a way of recording the in-progress status of each cycle\r\nthrough the process. In this way, multiple concurrent process instances (i.e.,\r\nprocurement action requests in progress) may be active in different steps\r\nat any time. Users can select the one the wish to work on by selecting from\r\nthe \"available tasks\" (not shown here) form maintained in a repository for\r\nuser-role, process-instance status. Depending on auditing requirements, other\r\nattributes indicating the date and time of step completion, PC network (IP)\r\naddress, etc. can be recorded and later replayed or analyzed for process\r\nimprovement opportunities. </p>\r\n \r\n<center>  \r\n<p><img src=\"Image4.gif\" height=\"458\" width=\"639\">\r\n  </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b>Figure 1</b>.

This view simply provides \r\nthe user with a validation of data submitted, and requires no further action \r\non the part of the user, unless they recognize an error in their data entry \r\n[cf. 12]. Nonetheless, the data that is posted can be automatically entered \r\ninto a logging procedure for proposals submitted to update pending procurement \r\nactions in the ONR corporate procurement database. This information can similarly \r\nbe used to automate the notification of proposal received to relevant ONR \r\ndivisions as well, as required in one of the transition steps noted in Table \r\n2. Server-side resources control repositories for executable process representations, \r\nuser role access, and database transactions. Other procurement process steps \r\nmay also use client-side \"helper application\" tools for editing data forms/records,\r\n preparing correspondence or presentation reporting materials, calculating\r\n spreadsheet functions, and database query and update transaction forms.\r\nThe multi-level scheme used for integrating different kinds of tools, data\r\nor legacy applications into a PDI, and the overall system architecture of\r\na PDI are described elsewhere [22, 23]. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Last, PDIs provide additional forms of security through fine-grain access\r\n control [cf. 3, 14, 30]. Specifically, when users access information through\r\n a PDI, they do so by first establishing their user-id, password, and process\r\n role. In a process involving many people performing in different roles,\r\nthe PDI can provide role-specific access to only those parts of the process\r\nthat a registered user in a designated role requires in order to complete\r\ntheir work. In this way, access to information can be specified and controlled\r\nby user-id, user group-id, assigned role or process step. As a person might\r\nalso have multiple roles in different processes, then access control can\r\nbe assigned in a corresponding manner. Similarly, access control can be further\r\nspecified by process step, since traversal of each process step in a PDI\r\nconstitutes an event or process transaction that can have pre-condition guards,\r\npost-condition triggers or other business rules assigned to them [cf. 23].\r\nFine-grain access controls such as these are now, in 1999, widespread on\r\nInternet-based EC sites and applications. </p>\r\n \r\n<h4> <i>Step 3: Facilitate the tactical challenges of expenditure management,\r\n data integrity, external customer queries through Internet-based systems\r\nintegration.</i></h4>\r\n  A recurring problem in the conduct of ONR's commerce was <i>expenditure\r\nmanagement</i> : determining how much unallocated research funds are available\r\nfor new procurement obligations, and how much has been actually encumbered\r\n(invoiced) or expended (disbursed). From a financial control standpoint,\r\ndisbursements represent an outward flow of funds, invoices represent bills\r\nsubmitted by service providers for payment (but subject to approval under\r\nFARs), while obligations represent budget allocations that can be altered\r\nat any time. If procurement action lead time (PALT) measurements exhibit\r\ncycle times measured in months or weeks, then uncertainty, misunderstanding,\r\nand organizational inefficiency can occur relative to the status of funds\r\navailability. For instance, if ONR disburses $1B/yr. for research procurements,\r\nthen on average it disburses about $20M/week. If PALT processing takes 6-10\r\nweeks, then the budget status of well over $100M may be in question, resulting\r\nin uncertainty and further delay in processing subsequent research procurement\r\nrequests. Reducing PALTs to days (or even to hours!) can mitigate these dilemmas.\r\n \r\n<p>At ONR, expenditure management was complicated by the fact that the requisite \r\ninformation was distributed across three distinct information systems and \r\nacross the four research acquisition processes. Each such system had its own\r\nadministrative authority, organizational location, database, data model, and\r\ndata format. Subsequently, as-is expenditure management reports and briefings \r\nfor ONR senior management had to be constructed on an ad hoc basis. This often\r\nrequired manually transcribing procurement expenditure data into PC-based \r\nspreadsheets, which in turn were summarized and incorporated into presentation \r\nmaterials (i.e., MS PowerPoint slides). The temporal relevancy of this data \r\nwas often 3-6 weeks old, whereas $500K to $3M or more might be expended on \r\na workday. Thus, a timely, less cumbersome solution was needed for expenditure \r\nmanagement. A view of the proposed solution can now be described. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>In Table 3, each of the three rightmost columns represents data managed\r\n by a separate database management system and administrative authority. Integrating \r\nthese heterogeneous databases into a single global database would be an expensive \r\nand time-consuming proposition. Therefore this was not a redesign option. \r\nInstead, the USC researchers proposed a networked form-based script that provides\r\nread-only views through a purpose-built data cache that periodically queries,\r\ndownloads, reformats, and sorts (using Award and Request Numbers as indices)\r\nthe funding data from each database. Table 3 shows a representative view\r\nintegration, although other ONR or provider-specific information is not shown.\r\nIn addition, ONR's external customers (E.g., Program Managers at DARPA) could\r\nquery-access this data through their role-specific views and Award numbers\r\nfrom a Web-based PDI user interface in their offices. </p>\r\n \r\n<center> \r\n<table border=\"1\" width=\"584\">\r\n  <tbody>\r\n     <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\" height=\"48\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">ONR AWARD NUMBER</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\" height=\"48\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">PR REQUEST NUMBER</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\" height=\"48\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">OBLIGATED FUNDING</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\" height=\"48\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">AMOUNT INVOICED</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"19%\" height=\"48\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">AMOUNT DISBURSED</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">N00014-95-1-0986</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">96PR03062-00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">100,000.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">100,000.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"19%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">100,000.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">N00014-94-2-0011</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">96PR04842-02</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">606,317.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">500,000.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"19%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">350,000.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">N00014-95-2-0014</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">96PR05343-00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">381,562.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">81,562.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"19%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">81,562.00</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">...</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">...</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">...</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">...</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"19%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">...</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n   <tr>\r\n  <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\"><font size=\"-1\">&nbsp;</font></td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"22%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">Totals</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">...</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"18%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">...</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n   <td valign=\"CENTER\" width=\"19%\">        \r\n      <center><b><font size=\"-1\">...</font></b></center>\r\n  </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n     \r\n  </tbody> \r\n</table>\r\n </center>\r\n    \r\n<center>  \r\n<p><b>Table 3</b><font size=\"-1\">: </font>A proposed integrated view of ONR\r\n funds across procurement expenditure processes</p>\r\n </center>\r\n    \r\n<p>ONR personnel indicated on-demand access to an integrated view of funding\r\n actions over an intranet would address critical decision-making needs in\r\nways not previously available.

Subsequently, being able to address\r\npractical problems such as expenditure management, status reporting and external\r\ncustomer queries may determine the eventual success in being able to apply\r\nthese results in other settings. </p>\r\n \r\n<h2> <i><font face=\"Arial\">4. Results and Discussion</font></i></h2>\r\n  This case study reveals six challenges in redesigning and transforming\r\nprocurement processes at ONR to realize Internet-based EC capabilities. Three\r\nsolution steps were identified to address and resolve the challenges. Surprisingly, \r\nnone of these challenges seem unique to the procurement of contracted services, \r\nprocurement of R&amp;D, or procurement processes specific to a government \r\norganization. Instead, these challenges may be typical for mid-to-large organizations \r\nthat want to redesign their procurement processes to exploit Internet-based \r\nEC capabilities [cf. 14, 26, 27, 32]. This requires further study to substantiate. \r\nNonetheless, the solution steps are specific to the IT resources, organizational \r\nsetting, OPA, and participants at ONR.  \r\n<p>The relatively ease with which the approach and results reported here\r\ncan be replicated outside of ONR is a matter of opinion. However, this case\r\nstudy conveys what was done, how it was accomplished, and how it might be\r\napplied, reproduced or reused in other organizational settings. For example,\r\nutilizing collaborative IT-based process management, the process redesign\r\nheuristics outlined in the Table 1, and change management techniques, we\r\nobserved a substantial reduction in cycle time for PALT. PALT measurements\r\nindicate the elapsed time at ONR from a research grant-funding obligation\r\nto the time when the grant recipient can begin to expend their funding award.\r\nAs more than 5000 research procurement actions are performed per year at\r\nONR (1995-1997), a reduction of average PALT from 70 days in 1994-5, to 7-10\r\ndays in 1997, to 2-3 days in early 1999 represents a demonstration of successful\r\nprocess reengineering and ongoing improvement at ONR. It also represents\r\nwhat people working together can accomplish when they collaborate in efforts\r\nthat were specified to make their work practices more timely, more efficient,\r\nand more effective through careful understanding and redesign of their OPA.\r\nOther proposed transformations such as the adoption and internal distribution\r\nof electronic research proposals, electronic budgets and associated procurement \r\nactions status tracking would save ONR $10M-$15M per year. Finally, the plan \r\nand steps for transitioning ONR to a PDI was developed by a collaborative \r\nprocess redesign team working using a process reengineering collaboratory \r\nmobilized for this effort. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>The action research method and shared effort agreements were also key\r\nenablers for achieving the results described here. Similarly, the OPA and\r\nprocess life cycle tools, techniques, and concepts employed were a key enabler\r\n[23, 28, 29]. Last, the capability to provide remote access to our research\r\ntechnologies to external customers and internal users, such as personnel\r\nat ONR Headquarters and at its five field offices across the U.S., was also\r\na key enabler helping to affect empowerment, distance learning, process redesign,\r\nand change management.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Finally, how do other alternatives to PDIs compare in addressing the challenges \r\nencountered at ONR? For example, the Zephyr System [9], and those from vendors \r\nsuch as Ariba Inc. or CommerceOne [27], can be considered a PDI for the procurement \r\nof non-commodity parts or MRO supplies, respectively. They differ from the \r\nPDI technology used in this study [23, 29] in that they are designed to specifically \r\nimplement processes for routine procurement and EC. Similarly, none of these \r\nother systems were designed nor implemented as a distributed multi-site collaboratory \r\n[18]. The PDI technology from USC takes an OPA specification as input, then \r\ncompiles it to automatically generate a PDI application corresponding to modeled\r\nprocess. This PDI capability can be used to collaboratively model, visualize,\r\nprototype, automate, or (re)engineer business processes of all kinds over\r\nthe Internet, whether or not the processes are related to routine or contracted\r\nservice procurement. In so doing, it then becomes possible to rapidly create\r\nPDI collaboratories for different types of processes, that can integrate\r\ndifferent types of data, data repositories, legacy applications, control\r\nand version management schemes, and multiple process instances [29]. Thus,\r\nwhile the alternative systems may be successful and easy to adopt or use\r\nin their targeted procurement processes, they would seem to be a poor fit\r\nfor the procurement processes for contracted services at ONR. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Beyond this, alternative systems may use XML based notations for specifying\r\n and exchanging procurement data formats as a technique for integrating disparate \r\nor heterogeneous systems. However, prior research has already revealed that \r\nintegrating heterogeneous systems across wide-area networks requires multiple \r\ntechniques for data, control flow, and process integration [22, 23, 28]. Similarly,\r\nthe technique used to address the expenditure management challenge at ONR\r\nrelies on computational methods (i.e., automated processes) to construct and\r\npresent an integrated view of data from multiple disparate databases. Markup\r\nnotations like HTML or XML serve to enable Web browsers (or other PC applications)\r\nto display or present shared data. Subsequently, view integration is the\r\ntechnical accomplishment that emulates heterogeneous systems integration, \r\nrather than the use of a data markup notation. Thus, at best techniques such \r\nas XML can simplify data exchange between heterogeneous systems, but they \r\ndo not address the range of issues or mechanisms needed for systems integration.\r\n </p>\r\n \r\n<p><b><i><font face=\"Arial\">5. Conclusions</font></i></b> </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Four questions motivated this research study. Each can now be reexamined\r\n in turn. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>First, the procurement of contracted research services at ONR is different\r\n from the routine procurement of materials, supplies and goods in a many\r\nways. Contracted services are procured incrementally over periods of months\r\nto year in the course of their completion, versus the quantity unit purchase\r\n transactions associated with routine procurements. PALTs are a key performance\r\n measure for contracted service procurement. ONR like other government agencies\r\n in the research service contract business are subject to Federal Acquisition\r\n Regulations which add process steps and problem-solving tasks that do not\r\n occur in commercial firms. Thus, procurement of contracted research services\r\n at ONR is sufficiently different than commercial packages targeted to support\r\n routine procurement activities over the Internet would not work without\r\nmodification, if that is possible. However, ONR is sufficiently like other\r\ngovernment research agencies in that understanding and redesigning its research\r\nprocurement processes may lead to solutions that can be reused in these agencies,\r\nand thus contribute in some way to a more efficient federal government. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Second, reengineering the processes for procuring contracted research\r\nservices at ONR was precipitated by a combination of concepts from BPR and\r\nEC together with IT-based process management tools. Nonetheless, the case\r\nstudy also makes clear that reengineering projects must address the organizational\r\nsituation, the roles participants play in understanding as-is and to-be versions\r\nof their procurement processes, and provide a transition path for how to\r\ntransform the situation, participants and processes. Off-the-shelf software\r\npackages that facilitate procurement services over the Internet by themselves\r\nwill not provide such an understanding of what exists, what's desired, nor\r\nhow to get from here to there. Change management techniques, collaborative\r\nlearning environments (PDIs), and process management technologies can however\r\nhelp.  </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Third, new IT or Web-based systems for process management can play a significant \r\nrole in facilitating the collaborative understanding, redesign and incremental \r\ntransformation of procurement processes for contracted services. This appears \r\nespecially true in an organization like ONR that has multiple field offices \r\nin geographically dispersed locations. Procurement processes for research \r\nservices are enacted and spread across multiple sites, systems, and administrative \r\nunits. Process-directed intranets represent an appealing choice for providing \r\na wide-area information infrastructure that supports collaborative learning \r\nthrough shared process management activities. PDIs model and enact organizational \r\nprocess architectures. A knowledge-based systems approach to process life \r\ncycle engineering of an OPA provides a strategy for how to blend process management\r\nactivities together with change management and organizational learning techniques.\r\nSuch an approach differs from conventional EC system approaches where the\r\nfocus may be aimed primarily at providing only the computational functions\r\nneeded to conduct purchasing or procurement transactions. Thus, they may\r\nnot be open to the needs identified in the preceding two research questions\r\n(e.g., ability to support FARs, support BPR change management and incremental\r\ntransformation techniques). </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Last, six challenges were encountered at ONR that made the transition\r\nto Web-based procurement processes problematic. However, these challenges\r\nwere specific to this case study, though they might also be found in other\r\nsettings. Nonetheless, resolving these problematic challenges required an\r\napproach to reengineering ONR's processes for procuring contracted research\r\nservices that provided a coherent, integrated approach to organizational\r\nchange management and process management. This approach was based on related\r\nresearch in BPR, EC and IT-based process life cycle engineering, that was\r\nput into practice and grounded through a three step, collaborative action\r\nresearch strategy. This approach proved successful in this case study at\r\nONR in giving rise to substantial reductions in the cycle time and operational\r\ncosts associated with the procurement of contracted research services. </p>\r\n \r\n<p>Overall, the four research questions that motivated this paper provide\r\n a new conceptual framework for understanding problems like how to reengineer\r\n procurement processes for contracted services using Internet-based, EC technologies. \r\nWhat is clear from this study, however, is that these technologies alone do\r\nnot affect a solution strategy, nor do they cause the organizational transformations \r\nneeded to transition new systems into productive operation. Instead, a more \r\ncomprehensive approach that combines and balances organizational change management \r\ntechniques with new Web-based process management technologies provides a promising\r\navenue for further research and practice in reengineering procurement processes.\r\n</p>\r\n \r\n<p>Acknowledgements </p>\r\n \r\n<p><font size=\"-1\">This research was supported by ONR contract N00014-94-1-0889\r\n and the Experimental Acquisition Research Program (EARP) of the Defense\r\nAcquisition University by grant N487650-27803.
