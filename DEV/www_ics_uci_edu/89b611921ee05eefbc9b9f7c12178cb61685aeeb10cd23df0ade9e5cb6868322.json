In order to use it, you first have to activate your UCInetID if you haven't already.  UCI provides all its students with basic computing, including electronic mail and other Internet services, via a \"UCInetID\" computer account.  Instructions for activating this account are available from several sources, but perhaps the easiest way is to activate your account on-line at <a href=\"http://activate.uci.edu/\">activate.uci.edu</a>.  All ICS 142 students need this account, both for using Checkmate, and also so that the course staff can email you when necessary.  If you have not activated your UCInetID, do so immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To use Checkmate once you've activated your UCInetID, all you need to do is go to <a href=\"http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/\">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a>, log in using your UCInetID, and follow the instructions there.  (If you get a message about security certificates, just click \"Continue.\")</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it has proved to be resilient in the past, you may encounter occasional outages, unexpected behavior, or unclear error messages when using Checkmate.  If you have any reason to believe that the system isn't working as you believe it should, read the instructions carefully, try it a second time, and if you're still having difficulty, send <a href=\"mailto:thornton@ics.uci.edu\">me</a> an email describing the problem as precisely as possible.  If you keep us informed about problems in a timely way, we will make sure that any problems with Checkmate won't affect your grade.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"history\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"nomarker\">\r\n  <li>Adapted from the ICS 22 Winter 2004 version of this document by Alex Thornton, Winter 2004.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
