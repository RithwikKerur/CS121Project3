If affords an immediate step,\nhowever, to associative indexing, the basic idea of which is a\nprovision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately\nand automatically another.  This is the essential feature of the\nmemex.  The process of tying two items together is the important\nthing.\n\n<p>\n\nWhen the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts the name in\nhis code book, and taps it out on his keyboard.  Before him are the\ntwo items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions.  At\nthe bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a\npointer is set to indicate one of these on each item.  The user taps a\nsingle key, and the items are permanently joined.  In each code space\nappears the code word.  Out of view, but also in the code space, is\ninserted a set of dots for photocell viewing; and on each item these\ndots by their positions designate the index number of the other item.\n\n<p>\n\nThereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other\ncan be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the\ncorresponding code space.  Moreover, when numerous items have been\nthus joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn,\nrapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning\nthe pages of a book.  It is exactly as though the physical items had\nbeen gathered together to form a new book.  It is more than this, for\nany item can be joined into numerous trails.\n\n<p>\n\nThe owner of the memex, let us say, is interested in the origin and\nproperties of the bow and arrow.  Specifically he is studying why the\nshort Turkish bow was apparently superior to the English long bow in\nthe skirmishes of the Crusades.  He has dozens of possibly pertinent\nbooks and articles in his memex.  First he runs through an\nencyclopedia, finds and interesting but sketchy article, leaves it\nprojected,  Next, in a history, he finds another pertinent item, and\nties the two together.  Thus he goes, building a trail of many items.\nOccasionally he inserts a comment of his own, either linking it into\nthe main trail or joining it by a side trail to a particular item.\nWhen it becomes evident that the elastic properties of available\nmaterials had a great deal to do with the bow, he branches off on a\nside trail which takes him through textbooks on elasticity and tables\nof physical constants.  He inserts a page of longhand analysis of his\nown.  Thus he builds a trail of his interest through the maze of\nmaterials available to him.\n\n<p>\n\nAnd his trails do not fade.  Several years later, his talk with a\nfriend turns to the queer ways in which a people resist innovations,\neven of vital interest.  He has an example, in the fact that the\noutranged Europeans still failed to adopt the Turkish bow.  In fact he\nhas a trail on it.  A touch brings up the code book.  Tapping a few\nkeys projects the head of the trail.  A lever runs through it at will,\nstopping at interesting items, going off on side excursions.  It is an\ninteresting trail, pertinent to the discussion.  So he sets a\nreproducer in action, photographs the whole trail out, and passes it\nto his friend for insertion in his own memex, there to be linked into\nthe more general trail.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Next:</b> <a href=\"section8.html\">Section 8</a>,\n<b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"section6.html\">Section 6</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
