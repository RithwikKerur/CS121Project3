I solve two open problems in drawing trees with low ply number.\n</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For any Delta, there is a value of alpha such that we can draw any tree with maximum degree Delta with an alpha-ply number of 1. Previously, this had only been studied for trees with degree 3.</li>\n<li>\nFor any Delta, we can draw trees of maximum degree Delta with O(log n) ply number in polynomial area. Previously, this was only possible for trees with maximum degree 6.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
