Perry and Alexander L. Wolf\nin <I>ACM SIGSOFT Software Engineering Notes</I>, vol. 17, no. 4,\npages 40-52, October 1992.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to build the foundation for software architecture.\nWe first develop an intuition for software architecture by appealing to several\nwell-established architectural disciplines.  On the basis of this intuition, we\npresent a model of software architecture that consists of three components:\nelements, form, and rationale.  Elements are either processing, data, or\nconnecting elements.  Form is defined in terms of the properties of, and the\nrelationships among, the elements---that is, the constraints on the elements.\nThe rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of\nthe system constraints, which most often derive from the system requirements.\nWe discuss the components of the model in the context of both architectures and\narchitectural styles and present an extended example to illustrate some\nimportant architecture and style considerations.  We conclude by presenting\nsome of the benefits of our approach to software architecture, summarizing our\ncontributions, and relating our approach to other current work.\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:23:52 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
