The model of computation \nis that a problem is broken up into tasks, and each computer in the project \nrequests a task from a central coordinator.  When it finishes computing the \ntask, it returns the results to the coordinator and requests a new task \nuntil the project is completed.  In order to keep network bandwidth to a \nminimum, the description and results of a task should be short, and each \ntask should take a moderate amount of time (say an hour or a day).</p>\n\n<p>Which of the exponential-algorithm paradigms we've seen in this course \n(e.g. generate-and-test, backtracking, dynamic programming, random-walk, \nand quantum computing) would be suitable for application in such a \ndistributed system?  For each paradigm, explain how it could be partitioned \ninto tasks or why it might be difficult to partition it into tasks.</p>\n\n<h3>Due <a href=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">by email</a>\nFriday, Dec. 8, 10:30AM.</h3>\n\nPlease <b>do not send MS Word</b> or other proprietary formats.\nPlain text, TeX, HTML, or PDF are all acceptable.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
