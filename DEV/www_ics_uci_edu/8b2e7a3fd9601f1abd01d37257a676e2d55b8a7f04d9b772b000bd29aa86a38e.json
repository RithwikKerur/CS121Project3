The boat was\r\ndetained in Yugoslavia for reasons unknown to me and after the Nazis occupied\r\nJugoslavia all the 1300 persons were put in a concentration camp in Kladova ,\r\nJugoslavia. In October 1941 they were transferred to a camp in Sabac\r\nJugoslavia and all were murdered  there by the Nazis\r\nAfter the war,the bodies were exhumed from their mass grave in Sabac,\r\nYugoslavia. and reburied in a Jewish cemetery in Belgrade.\r\nMy  mother, Esther and her two sons waited in Danzig for opportunities to\r\nflee. We left with 500 others, the last to successfully leave, on a train to\r\nBratislava and from here continued on an illegal aliyah ship. After 3 month\r\nof  hardship on the boat where 1800 people were herded into a 500 ton\r\nfreighter we arrived in Haifa. We were brought to a camp in Athlit and\r\ndetained by the British Mandate Police. Here my brother Herman died of typhoid\r\nat the age of 3\r\nMy Mother Esther and myself (Oscar) were exiled to Mauritius until August\r\n1945. Esther remarried but had no more children.\r\n As for myself:  Oscar Langsam married Helga Hadassa Goldrosen in 1954. we\r\nlive now in Rehovot , Israel, have a son Nachum , a daughter Racheli and 6\r\ngrandchildren.\r\nAttached my family tree and a picture of the family\r\nsincerely your's , Oscar Langsam ,       Israel\r\n____________________________________________________________\r\nFrom:  ichisholm@bcps.org\r\nSubject:  Re: Any news from Jessica Langsam Chisholm ?\r\nPostedDate:  05/03/99 12:18:20 PM\r\nSendTo:  CN=Moishe Miller/OU=PSG/O=Prudential\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Miller,\r\n\r\n    My wife Jessica Chisholm's current mailing address is:\r\n    7355 Kindler Rd.\r\n    Columbia, MD 21046\r\n\r\nI'll forward your e-mail questions to her today.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nIan Chisholm\r\n\r\n----------\r\n>From: moishe@langsam.com\r\n>To: ichisholm@bcps.org\r\n>Subject: Re: Any news from Jessica Langsam Chisholm ?\r\n>Date: Sun, Apr 11, 1999, 4:54 PM\r\n>\r\n\r\n> Hi,\r\n> Can you pass this along to your wife and provide some feedback?\r\n> Thanks!\r\n> -Moishe\r\n> moishe@langsam.com\r\n> ---------------------- Forwarded by Moishe Miller/PSG/Prudential on\r\n> 04/11/99 11:57 AM ---------------------------\r\n>\r\n> techspec@ea.net\r\n> Sunday April 11, 1999 11:00 AM\r\n> To:   Moishe Miller/PSG/Prudential\r\n> cc:\r\n> Subject:  Re: Any news from Jessica Langsam Chisholm ?\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> Jessica does not have her own email account, but her husband does.

He had an interesting take \r\non Pesach.  His family lore has it that Pesach is a direct descendant of \r\nIssachar, son of Jacob.  Though he states that his family is connected \r\nto Pesach Langsam, he does not say how. What he does know is that his \r\ngrandparents were Hersch and Ruchel Langsam from Blazowa.\r\n     \r\nHis father, Aaron, their son, was able to get on an illegal ship from \r\nDanzig to Palestine with about 1300 others.

The 3 year boy died \r\nof typhoid.  Esther and Oscar were exiled to Mauritius until August \r\n1945.  Esther remarried and had two more children. \r\n     \r\nOscar sent a tree but I couldn't read it.  I've asked him to mail it to \r\nme since we've had such difficulty communicating.\r\n     \r\nI've asked him if he knows more about how his grandfather might have \r\nbeen connected to Pesach Langsam's children. As far as I know, his \r\nfamily is not in the book. \r\n     \r\nSuzan\r\n     \r\n\r\nOscar's address is \r\noscar@netvision.net.il\r\n________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Thu, 12 Jul 2001 22:12:27 -0400\r\nTo: oscar@netvision.net.il\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Are these your grandparents?\r\n\r\nDear Oscar, \r\n\r\nPlease see line #11 and tell me with if this record for Hersch Langsam \r\nof Blazow with wife Rachel still there are your grandparents?
