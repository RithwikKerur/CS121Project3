In this paper,\nwe study the k-Modality problem, which asks for the existence of a k-modal embedding of\na planar digraph. This combinatorial problem is at the very core of a variety of constrained\nembeddings questions for planar digraphs and flat clustered networks.\nFirst, since the 2-Modality problem can be easily solved in linear time, we consider the\ngeneral k-Modality problem for any value of k > 2 and show that the problem is NP-complete\nfor planar digraphs of maximum degree   k + 3. We relate its computational complexity to\nthat of two notions of planarity for flat clustered networks: Planar Intersection-Link\nand Planar NodeTrix representations. This allows us to answer in the strongest\npossible way an open question by Di Giacomo et al., concerning the complexity of\nconstructing planar NodeTrix representations of flat clustered networks with small clusters,\nand to address a research question by Angelini et al. , concerning intersection-link\nrepresentations based on geometric objects that determine complex arrangements. On the\npositive side, we provide a simple FPT algorithm for partial 2-trees of arbitrary degree, whose\nrunning time is exponential in k and linear in the input size.\nSecond, motivated by the recently-introduced planar L-drawings of planar digraphs,\nwhich require the computation of a 4-modal embedding, we focus our attention on k = 4. On\nthe algorithmic side, we show a complexity dichotomy for the 4-Modality problem with\nrespect to , by providing a linear-time algorithm for planar digraphs with   6. This\nalgorithmic result is based on decomposing the input digraph into its blocks via BC-trees and\neach of these blocks into its triconnected components via SPQR-trees. In particular, we are able\nto show that the constraints imposed on the embedding by the rigid triconnected components\ncan be tackled by means of a small set of reduction rules and discover that the algorithmic\ncore of the problem lies in special instances of NAESAT, which we prove to be always\nNAE-satisfiablea result of independent interest that improves on Porschen et al.\nFinally, on the combinatorial side, we consider outerplanar digraphs and show that any\nsuch a digraph always admits a k-modal embedding with k = 4 and that this value of k is\nbest possible for the digraphs in this family.\n\n\n<p>\n(joint work with Giordano Da Lozzo and Michael T Goodrich)\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
