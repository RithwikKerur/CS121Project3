This problem is stated\non p. 265-6 of Joseph O'Rourke's book \"Art Gallery Theorems and Algorithms.\"\nHe states \"The original poser of the problem is unknown; Klee \npopularized the problem in two articles\" (which are:\n\"Is every polygonal region illuminable from some point?\"\n          Amer. Math. Monthly 76 (1969), 180.\n\"Some unsolved problems in plane geometry,\" \n          Math. Mag. 52 (1979), 131-145.).\n \nFor those of you without access to O'Rourke's book, here are the precise\nproblems, and what is known about them:\n\n\"Let P be a polygon and imagine that all of its edges are perfect mirrors.\nIs there always at least one interior point from which P is completely \nilluminable by a point light bulb?  Is P always illuminable from\n_each_ of its points?  Assume that the light bulb sends out rays in all\ndirections, and that the standard 'angle of reflection = angle of\nincidence' law of reflection holds.  Further assume that a light ray is \nabsorbed if it hits a vertex.  Surprisingly, these problems are unsolved for\npolygons. However, Klee showed the answers to be 'no' if curved\n(differentiable) arcs are permitted.\"  \n\n(In the book are two figures with curved arcs.  One shows a region that\nis not illuminable from a point x, but is illuminable from another point y.\nBasically x is at the center of 2 semicircles, the upper one having a\nlarger radius than the lower one and there are some bays between the\ntwo arcs.  You can use your imagination to reconstruct it from the following:\n                .---------------------.   \n               /           y           \\ &lt;== top circular arc\n               |                       |\n               |                       |\n               |                       |\n                \\_ _/|     x     |\\_ _/  &lt;== bay\n                     |           |\n                      \\_________/   &lt;== bottom circular arc\n\nThe other shows a region that is not illuminable from any of its points.\nThere are two elliptical arcs with foci (a,b) and (a',b') and some bays.\nAny light source above the a'b' major axis will not illuminate regions\nA' or B', and similarly for below the ab axis.  And a light source in A\nwill bounce into B and back again, never illuminating A' or B'.\nYou can use your imagination to reconstruct it from the following:\n                .--------------------------.   \n               /                            \\ &lt;== top elliptical arc\n               |                            |\n               |                            |\n               |         a       b          |\n                \\___A___/\\       /\\___B____/  &lt;== bays\n                          |     |\n                          |     |\n                 _______  |     |  ________   \n                /   A'  \\/       \\/   B'   \\  &lt;== bays\n               |         a'      b'         |\n               |                            |\n               |                            |\n               \\                            / &lt;== bottom elliptical arc\n                \\__________________________/   \n).\n\nO'Rourke goes on to say:\n\n\"Although the problem remains unsolved for polygonal regions, some progress\nhas been made in understanding the behavior of single light rays in a\n_rational_ polygon, one whose angles are all rational multiples of $\\Pi$.\n(Orthogonal polygons are a very special case of rational polygons.)  A\nsingle light ray is more usually called a \"billiard ball\" in the now rather\nsubstantial literature on the subject...\n\nTheorem 10.4 [Boldrighini et al. 1978' Kerckhoff et al. 1985].  Let x be\na point in a rational polygon P and $\\Theta$ a direction.  Then, except\nfor a countable number of \"exceptional\" directions $\\Theta$, the path of\na billiard ball issuing from x in the direction $\\Theta$ is spatially dense\nin P, that is, passes arbitrarily lose to every point of P.\n\nOne implication of this result is that every rational polygon is \nilluminable from each of its points in the sense that no finite area\nregion will be left unilluminated;  whether an isolated point could remain\nin the dark is unclear.\n\nFor irrational polygons, almost nothing is known.  It is not even known \nif every triangle admits a dense billiard path.\"\n\nC. Boldrighini, M. Keane, and F. Marchetti, \"Billiards in polygons,\"\n   Ann. Prob. 6 (1978), 532-540.\nS. Kerckhoff, H.
