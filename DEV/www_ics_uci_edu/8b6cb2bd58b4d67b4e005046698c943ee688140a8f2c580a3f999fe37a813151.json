Information about the meeting can be\nfound at:\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/cambridge/\n\nThere were 18 attendees at this meeting, a complete list of which can\nbe found at\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/cambridge/Participants.html.\nThese attendees were members of companies which make general purpose\napplication software, document management systems, configuration\nmanagement systems, distributed authoring tools, and networking\nsoftware, along with researchers in hypertext versioning, and many\nparticipants from the World Wide Web Consortium.\n\nThe meeting was very productive.  The main accomplishments of the\nmeeting were:\n\n  - reaching rough consensus on the draft distributed authoring\n    requirements\n  - reaching rough consensus on the draft versioning requirements\n  - an understanding of the language and terminology being used\n\nAdditionally, there was much discussion of various approaches for\naddressing these requirements.  There was some discussion on the \ndraft charter for the working group, which generated some good\nfeedback.\n\nThe meeting produced several action items:\n\n1. Modify the distributed authoring requirements, \"Requirements\n   on HTTP for Distributed Content Editing,\" based on comments\n   received at the meeting.  Assigned: Jim Whitehead, due: 9/20/96\n\n2. Revise the versioning requirements, \"Functional Requirements and\n   Framework for Versioning on the WWW,\" based on feedback received\n   at the meeting.  Assigned: David Durand, due 9/27/96.\n\n3. Revise the draft charter based on feedback received at the meeting,\n   and also from the mailing list.  Assigned: Jim Whitehead, due: 9/20/96\n\n4. Submit a draft distributed authoring and versioning scenarios\n   document to the mailing list for review.  Assigned: Ora Lasilla,\n   due: 9/20/96\n\nAdditionally, several documents were promised by meeting participants:\n\n- A draft protocol specification for distributed authoring and verisoning\n  capability, Yaron Goland, by 9/20/96\n\n- A document listing scenarios which result in server-to-server \n  communication, Stephen Carter, week of 9/23-9/27/96.\n\nWe also revisited action items from the San Mateo meeting:\n\n- Create a task-oriented list of scenarios which interoperable\n  distributed authoring tools should be able to perform. Keith Dawson,\n  Atria, is the editor of this document.\n\nDue to other commitments, Keith is unable to edit this document. Ora\nLasilla has graciously agreed to become the editor of the scenarios\ndocument, and will be producing a draft shortly.\n\n- Create a list which collates the \"key functionality\" among\n  AOLpress/AOLserver, FrontPage, Word, as well as other distributed\n  authoring tools. Dave Long, America Online, is the editor of this\n  document.\n\nThe general sentiment is that while this document would still be\nuseful to produce, its main purpose was to motivate the generation\nof requirements, which has already occurred without having this\ninformation.  Dave Long is still willing to accept contributions\nand edit them.  However, this activity is currently low priority.\n\n- Criteria for completion of the group's work were discussed, and need\n  to be clearly described in writing.\n\nI have submitted a draft read/write interoperability definition to the\nworking group.  This document still requires revision, and feedback.\nRead/write interoperability is only one aspect of this group's work,\nand more effort needs to go into defining exit criteria.\n\n- The working group was tentatively interested in seeking sponsorship\n  by the W3C. However,before the group is officially sponsored, members\n  needs to know the intellectual property rights implications of such\n  sponsorship.\n\nThe working group is still interested in pursuing W3C sponsorship, due\nto the perception that it can move more rapidly in standards development.\nThe issue of intellectual property rights has still not been addressed,\nbeyond a general sentiment that the results of the working group should\nbe open, and non-proprietary.\n\n- There should be a reinvestigation of work previously performed by\n  Murray Maloney on standard LINK REL and REV tags.\n\nWhile there is still some disagreement on whether this group should \nattempt to define some standard link types, with the dominant opinion\nholding that this group should not, this document is still of interest\nto our discussions.  Originally issued as an internet-draft, it has\ncurrently expired.  I have made it available from the working group\npage, and at URL:\n\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/draft-ietf-html-relrev-00.txt\n\n- There should be an investigation by the versioning and configuration\n  management group into the utility of entity tags (etags) for\n  performing versioning.\n\nAs a result of this action item, there was some discussion on the\nmailing list about use of entity tags.  However, there is still a real\nneed to collect this information about entity tags into one\ndefinitive, \"use of entity tags in versioning\" document, which\nlists their uses and limitations.  Any takers?  I asked for\nvolunteers at the meeting, but there were no takers.  However,\nthere was some interest in having another thread on the issue.\nWould someone like to start?\n\n- Jim Whitehead <ejw@ics.uci.edu>\n\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
