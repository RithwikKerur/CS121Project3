Freedman, Stanislaw Jarecki,&nbsp;Shabsi Walfish</B></P>\r\n<P>ABSTRACT:\r\n</P>\r\n<P>We build several highly-practical and optimized signcryption constructions \r\n\tdirectly from trapdoor permutations, in the random oracle model.&nbsp; All our \r\n\tconstructions share features such as simplicity, efficiency, generality, \r\n\tnear-optimal exact security, flexible and ad-hoc key management, key reuse for \r\n\tsending/receiving data, optimally-low message expansion, \"backward\" use for \r\n\tplain signature/encryption, long message and associated data support, the \r\n\tstronger known qualitative security (so-called IND-CCA and sUF-CMA) and, \r\n\tfinally, compatibility with the PKCS#1 infrastructure.&nbsp; While some of \r\n\tthese features are present in previous works to various extents, we believe \r\n\tthat our schemes improve on earlier proposals in at least several dimensions.</P>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
