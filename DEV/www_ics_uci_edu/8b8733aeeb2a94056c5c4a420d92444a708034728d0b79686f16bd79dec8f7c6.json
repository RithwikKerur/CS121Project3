A relevant\nproblem is to partition a graph into as many disjoint edge\ncoverings as possible. Generally it is hard to get a lower bound of\nthe second problem on any class of graphs. But if we loosen the constraint of\n'edge covering' by allowing one vertex not covered, there come some\ninteresting results.\n\nWe call a set of edges covering all vertices except $v$ a $v$-excluding edge\ncovering and denote it by $C(v)$. Then we show that a serial parallel graph\ncan be partitioned into $\\kappa^{\\prime}$ disjoint $C(v)$'s, where\n$\\kappa^{\\prime}$ is the edge connectivity and $v$ is arbitrary. Furthermore,\nthough we can't make a formal conjection, we hope that planar graphs also\nhave such partitions with cardinality $\\kappa^{\\prime}$. And this proposition\non planar graph is stronger than the 4-Color Theorem.\n\nOur talk will focus on an algorithmic proof on serial parallel graphs.\n\n\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
