Server\nIn one window, run\n\t./server\nor\n\t./server -p <port#>\nif you want to specify a port on the command line.\nThe server runs forever, accepting connections (one at a time).\nBreak out of it via ^C (or whatever your interrupt character is).\n\nThe server simply accepts connections and prints the address and port\nof the connecting client.\n\n2. Client\nIn another window (possibly on another machine), run the client:\n\t./client\n\nThe usage for client is\n\tclient [-h host] [-p port]\n\nIf you are running the client on another machine, you must specify the\nmachine where the server is running. If you specified a port number on the\nserver with -p, you'll need to tell the client to use the same port. For example:\n\tclient -h romulus -p 2422\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
