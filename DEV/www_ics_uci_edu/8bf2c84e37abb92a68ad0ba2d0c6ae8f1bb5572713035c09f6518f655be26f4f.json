No 2 of the chords intersect\nin the interior of the polygon.\n\nI want to know how many different areas are possible.  Formally,\nI want a function t(n) as large as possible (linear would be ideal)\nsatisfying:\n\nfor all n-vertex convex polygons there exists a triangulation\ncontaining at least t(n) triangles of different areas.\n\nI have not seen how to create an example in which 3 triangles\nmust have the same area.  I would be interested in such an\nexample, if it exists.\n\nThe polygons I am interested in are special.  They lie in planes\nin R^3, and all of the vertices are lattice points, within the\nm x m x m cube.  The normal directions to the planes can be written\nwith integer coordinates at most m.  An answer in terms of m would \nbe helpful, although less satisfying.\n\nEddie Grove\n                                Eddie Grove\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
