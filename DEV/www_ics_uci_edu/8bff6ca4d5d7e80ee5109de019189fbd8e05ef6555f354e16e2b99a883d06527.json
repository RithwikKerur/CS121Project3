As they begin to dry out,\nthe water starts to evaporate.  And after a while enough water has evaporated\nso that the potatoes are now 98% water.\nIf you were to weigh those potatoes at that moment when they are 98%\nwater, how much would they weigh?\n      </li><li> Three different numbers are chosen at random, and one is written\non each of three slips of paper. The slips are then placed face down on\nthe table. The objective is to choose the slip upon which is written the\nlargest number.  Here are the rules: You can turn over any slip of paper\nand look at the amount written on it. If for any reason you think this\nis the largest, you're done; you keep it. Otherwise you discard it and\nturn over a second slip. Again, if you think this is the one with the\nbiggest number, you keep that one and the game is over. If you don't,\nyou discard that one too, in which case you're stuck with the third one.\n<br>\nThe chance of getting the highest number is one in three.\nOr is it? Is there a strategy by which you can improve the odds?\n      </li><li> How can you identify the one heavy coin out of fifty in just\nfour weighings using a balance scale?\n      </li><li> In how many ways can you change one dollar\n(allowing pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, half dollars)?\n      </li><li> At one point, a remote island's population of chameleons was\ndivided as follows: 13 red chameleons, 15 green chameleons, 17 blue chameleons.\nEach time two different colored chameleons would meet, they would change\ntheir color to the third color.  Is it ever possible for all chameleons\nto become the same color?  Why or why not?\n    </li></ul>\n</li></ul>\n<p>\n\n</p><hr>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Egoodrich\">\nMichael Goodrich</a> <br>\n<address>\nComputer Science Department<br>\nUniversity of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3435\n</address>\n<tt>goodrich at ics.uci.edu</tt><br>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
