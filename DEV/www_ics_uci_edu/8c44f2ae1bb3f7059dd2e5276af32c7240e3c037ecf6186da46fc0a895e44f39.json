Usually a traditional wacipi will \noccur during the summer months and can last about three days, beginning \nat noon and continuing on till the wee hours of the morning.  There are \nvarious styles of dance for men and women, each with their own origin \nmyths.  The men may dance Traditonal, Grass Dance, or Fancy \nWar, whereas the women dance Traditional, Fancy Shawl, or Jingle Dress.  \nFor each style, the regalia clearly defines the differences.  However; \none thing that is common to the dancers outfit is the footgear, also\nknown as moccasins which can be adorned with <A \nHREF=\"http://www.state.sd.us/state/executive/tourism/sioux/artifact.htm\"> \nquillwork</A> or beadwork.    \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>What type of syntax does the Mosaic browser read?\n\n</B></A><br>\nThis question was originally, for the Jingle Dress dance style, what \ntribe did it originate from?  The answer regarding syntax that the Mosaic \nbrowser can read is <A \nHREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html#4\"> HTML</A> \n(Hypertext Markup Language).  This language utilizes documents which \ncontain hypertext links, the relationship between two documents, which \nallows a viewer the ability to jump from page to page by using the 'mouse' \nto point and click to the desired document. The\n<A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html\">elements of \nHTML</A> are very important, they are what comprise an appropriate \ndocument.  There are many things which should be included in an HTML \ndocument; however the most important are the 'links' and what is included \nin the text portion.\n\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>What tribe did the U.S. Government first promise physician\nservices as partial payment for rights & property ceded?</B></A><br> \nThe U.S. Government's first <A \nHREF=\"http://www.tucson.ihs.gov/Docs/GenFolder/IHSFacts.html\">Federal-Tribal \nrelationship</A> that promised physician services was with the Winnebago \ntribe in 1832. Today this agreement is referred to as \nthe <A HREF=\"http://www.tucson.ihs.gov/Docs/GenFolder/IHSProfile.html\"> \nIndian Health Service (IHS)</A>.  The IHS was established to meet the health\nneeds of American Indian and Alaska Native people on and off the \nreservations.  The services provided include hospitals, emergency rooms, \nand health management.  Even though this modern-day medical service is \nprovided as a result from past treaties and agreements, the American Indian \npeople are not always openly accepting towards a 'strange' medicine.  For \nhundreds of years, they have relied upon traditional means of curing - \ntheir spirituality (healing the whole, rather than the part) and turning to \nMother Earth for roots and herbs.\n\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>Where would one go to learn about Labanotation?</B></A><br>\nInterestingly enough one can learn about Labanotation here \nat <A HREF=\"http://www.cwis.uci.edu/information.html\"> UCI</A>.  There are \ncurrently two professors within the \n<A HREF=\"gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/new.cat/fa/dance\">Dance \nDepartment</A> who are certified Labanotators: the Chair of the Dance \nDepartment - Professor James Penrod, and Mary Corey.  Labanotation is the \nway in which one records dance movement and steps through a system of \nsymbols that represent body parts, direction (three-dimensionally) and \ntiming (phrasing and musicality).  All the elements involved with a \ndancer and her movements. This method of notation allows choreographers \nto preserve their 'works' in exact duplication, rather than relying on \nmemory or handwritten notes (usually the interpretation gets lost with \nwords and is not always comprehensible by others reading the notes).   It's \ncomparable to learning a foreign language. \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>What can the World Wide Web offer?\n</B></A><br>\nIt has become a cold-hard fact that computers are an integral part of \ntoday's society.  The World Wide Web was proposed \nby <A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/People/Berners-Lee-Bio.html\"> \nTim Berners-Lee</A> of \nthe <A HREF=\"http://www.cern.ch/\">CERN</A> laboratory in Geneva, \nSwitzerland to be a system which could \neasily be accessed universally by anyone with Internet connections.  By \nmeans of the Web, one has connections to various forms of multimedia - \nsound, music, video, games and CD-ROM.  Since the Web was set up to be as \nsimple as possible, a person can locate information such as universities \nin the United States, find out the weather in a certain city or even read \ncartoons.  The search is endless and 'surfing' the Web allows people in \nvarious fields a chance to locate their interests and needs.  FYI:  this \nquestion was formerly - what university is ranked number one for their \nDance Department?\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 13, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
