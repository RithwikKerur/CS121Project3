It's formed by cutting\nspace by a hyperplane, then recursively partitioning each of the two\nresulting halfspaces.  The result is a hierarchical decomposition of\nspace into convex cells.</P>\n\n<P>In 1974, <a href=\"refs.html#Tv\">Helge Tverberg</a> showed that, given\nany convex polytope K, one can find a binary space partition that decomposes\nK into simplices.  This is obvious for two dimensional polytopes (just\nrepeatedly cut along polygon diagonals); the general proof proceeds by\ninduction on dimension and number of faces:</P>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nWe assume K is not a simplex or we would already be done.\n\n<P>If K has a vertex P incident to more than d facets, then (by induction on dimension) we can partition K by hyperplanes through P into smaller polytopes\neach of which has exactly d facets incident to P.\nThe number of facets not incident to P in each of these polytopes\nis at most the same as in K, so each smaller polytope has fewer facets than K.\nBy induction on number of facets, we can recursively partition the smaller polytopes into simplices.\n\n<P>On the other hand suppose that each vertex of K has only d incident facets.\nLet P be a vertex of K that is not adjacent to some two facets F1 and F2\n(we can find P, F1, and F2 by induction on dimension if K has a non-simplicial facet; if all facets of K are simplices, let F1 and F2 be two adjacent facets and P be any vertex other than the d+1 vertices shared by F1 and F2).\nLet L be the hyperline contained in the hyperplanes through F1 and F2,\nand cut K by a hyperplane through P and L.\nThen each of the two pieces avoids one of the facets Fi, but has a new facet\non the cut plane, so its number of facets is not increased.\nOne can show that each piece either has more than d facets at P\n(in which case we can apply the previous case), or avoids an additional\nfacet of K (in which case we can apply induction on the number of\nfacets), so either way we can partition each piece recursively.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nThe number of cuts in this partition may be exponential in the number of facets,\nbut this seems unavoidable due to examples like the hypercube which have few facets but require many cuts.\n\n<P>Tverberg then proves that the Euler characteristic X(K)\n(as defined more precisely for the\n<a href=\"shell.html\">shelling proof</a>) is always zero,\nby induction on dimension and on the number of cuts in the binary space\npartition:\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nIf K is a simplex, the number of faces of any dimension is\ncounted by a binomial coefficient, and the identity X(K)=0\nis just the application of the binomial theorem to\nthe evaluation of (1+x)<sup>d</sup> at x&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1.\n\n<P>Otherwise, let the top level cut of the\nbinary space partition split K into\ntwo polytopes K1 and K2.  Let K3 be the convex hull of\nthe set of vertices of K that are contained in the cutting hyperplane,\nand let K4 be the intersection of K with the cutting hyperplane.\nThen we have the formula\n\n<DIV ALIGN=CENTER>\nX(K) = X(K1) + X(K2) + 2 X(K3) - 3 X(K4),\n</DIV>\n\n<P>since each face of K is either contained in the cutting hyperplane\n(contributing to all four terms X(Ki)), split by the cutting hyperplane\n(forming a face of one lower dimension in K1, K2, and K4, and\ncontributing a negated term to each of these three polytopes' Euler\ncharacteristics), or is contained in one of the two halfspaces (and\ncontributes only to X(K1) or X(K2)).\n\n<P>K1 and K2 have smaller binary space partitions, and K3 and K4 have lower dimension, so by induction all have zero Euler characteristic.\nTherefore, X(K) is also zero.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
