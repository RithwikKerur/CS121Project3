Use\nthe div/mod algorithm introduced in lecture for performing the operations.\nRemember that your div/mod entity should contain the datapath and the\ncontroller entities.\n\nImplement an exhaustive testbench for your div/mod sequential entity in\nVHDL.\n\nSimulate your testbench and div/mod entity and show the wave-forms of input\nand output signals to your TA. Make sure your TA checks out your demo. This\nwill be worth 70% of the points for this project.\n\nComplete a report and attach to it all source VHDL files. Your report should\ninclude your name, a description of the VHDL files attached, any special\nnotes or comments, and a description of how you tested your design. Also, your\nreport should contain the datapath drawing and controller FSM. How many clock\ncycles does your processor take to compute one div/mod operation?\n\nYour TA will provide you with information on tools, lab setup, and other things\nrelated to this project. Make sure you seek help to get you started.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
