We give new algorithms that with high\nprobability achieve a poly-logarithmic fraction (in the size of the\nnetwork) of the optimal solution. The decisions of our algorithms do not\ndepend on the current load of all network links, as in previous\nalgorithms for general network topologies [AAP93]. Instead, their\nadmission decisions depend only on link loads along a single path\nbetween the communicating parties, and they can thus be performed in a\ndistributed hop-by-hop manner through the network. Furthemore, our\nalgorithms can handle concurrent requests in the network.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
