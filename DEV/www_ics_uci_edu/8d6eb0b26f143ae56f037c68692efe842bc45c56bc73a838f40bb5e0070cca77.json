This prevents the \"lost update problem,\"\n   in which modifications are lost as first one author then another\n   writes changes without merging the other author's changes.\n</t><t>\n   Namespace Operations: The ability to instruct the server to copy and\n   move Web resources.\n</t><t>\n   Requirements and rationale for these operations are described in a\n   companion document, \"Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and\n   Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web\" <xref target=\"RFC2291\" />.\n</t><t>\n   The sections below provide a detailed introduction to resource\n   properties (section 4), collections of resources (section 5), and\n   locking operations (section 6).  These sections introduce the\n   abstractions manipulated by the WebDAV-specific HTTP methods\n   described in section 8, \"HTTP Methods for Distributed Authoring\".\n</t><t>\n   In HTTP/1.1, method parameter information was exclusively encoded in\n   HTTP headers. Unlike HTTP/1.1, WebDAV encodes method parameter\n   information either in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) <xref target=\"REC-XML\" />\n   request entity body, or in an HTTP header.  The use of XML to encode\n   method parameters was motivated by the ability to add extra XML\n   elements to existing structures, providing extensibility; and by\n   XML's ability to encode information in ISO 10646 character sets,\n   providing internationalization support. As a rule of thumb,\n   parameters are encoded in XML entity bodies when they have unbounded\n   length, or when they may be shown to a human user and hence require\n   encoding in an ISO 10646 character set.  Otherwise, parameters are\n   encoded within HTTP headers.  Section 9 describes the new HTTP\n   headers used with WebDAV methods.\n</t><t>\n   In addition to encoding method parameters, XML is used in WebDAV to\n   encode the responses from methods, providing the extensibility and\n   internationalization advantages of XML for method output, as well as\n   input.\n</t><t>\n   XML elements used in this specification are defined in section 12.\n</t><t>\n   The XML namespace extension (Appendix 4) is also used in this\n   specification in order to allow for new XML elements to be added\n   without fear of colliding with other element names.\n</t><t>\n   While the status codes provided by HTTP/1.1 are sufficient to\n   describe most error conditions encountered by WebDAV methods, there\n   are some errors that do not fall neatly into the existing categories.\n   New status codes developed for the WebDAV methods are defined in\n   section 10.  Since some WebDAV methods may operate over many\n   resources, the Multi-Status response has been introduced to return\n   status information for multiple resources.  The Multi-Status response\n   is described in section 11.\n</t><t>\n   WebDAV employs the property mechanism to store information about the\n   current state of the resource.  For example, when a lock is taken out\n   on a resource, a lock information property describes the current\n   state of the lock. Section 13 defines the properties used within the\n   WebDAV specification.\n</t><t>\n   Finishing off the specification are sections on what it means to be\n   compliant with this specification (section 15), on\n   internationalization support (section 16), and on security (section\n   17).\n</t>\n</section>\n\n\n<section title=\"Notational Conventions\">\n<t>\n   Since this document describes a set of extensions to the HTTP/1.1\n   protocol, the augmented BNF used herein to describe protocol elements\n   is exactly the same as described in section 2.1 of <xref target=\"RFC2068\" />.  Since\n   this augmented BNF uses the basic production rules provided in\n   section 2.2 of <xref target=\"RFC2068\" />, these rules apply to this document as well.\n</t><t>\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n   \"SHOULD\", SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\n   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target=\"RFC2119\" />.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Terminology\">\n<t>\n   URI/URL - A Uniform Resource Identifier and Uniform Resource Locator,\n   respectively. These terms (and the distinction between them) are\n   defined in <xref target=\"RFC2396\" />.\n</t><t>\n   Collection - A resource that contains a set of URIs, termed member\n   URIs, which identify member resources and meets the requirements in\n   section 5 of this specification.\n</t><t>\n   Member URI - A URI which is a member of the set of URIs contained by\n   a collection.\n</t><t>\n   Internal Member URI - A Member URI that is immediately relative to\n   the URI of the collection (the definition of immediately relative is\n   given in section 5.2).\n</t><t>\n   Property - A name/value pair that contains descriptive information\n   about a resource.\n</t><t>\n   Live Property - A property whose semantics and syntax are enforced by\n   the server.  For example, the live \"getcontentlength\" property has\n   its value, the length of the entity returned by a GET request,\n   automatically calculated by the server.\n</t><t>\n   Dead Property - A property whose semantics and syntax are not\n   enforced by the server.  The server only records the value of a dead\n   property; the client is responsible for maintaining the consistency\n   of the syntax and semantics of a dead property.\n</t><t>\n   Null Resource - A resource which responds with a 404 (Not Found) to\n   any HTTP/1.1 or DAV method except for PUT, MKCOL, OPTIONS and LOCK.\n   A NULL resource MUST NOT appear as a member of its parent collection.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Data Model for Resource Properties\">\n\n<section title=\"The Resource Property Model\">\n<t>\n   Properties are pieces of data that describe the state of a resource.\n   Properties are data about data.\n</t><t>\n   Properties are used in distributed authoring environments to provide\n   for efficient discovery and management of resources.  For example, a\n   'subject' property might allow for the indexing of all resources by\n   their subject, and an 'author' property might allow for the discovery\n   of what authors have written which documents.\n</t><t>\n   The DAV property model consists of name/value pairs.  The name of a\n   property identifies the property's syntax and semantics, and provides\n   an address by which to refer to its syntax and semantics.\n</t><t>\n   There are two categories of properties: \"live\" and \"dead\".  A live\n   property has its syntax and semantics enforced by the server. Live\n   properties include cases where a) the value of a property is read-\n   only, maintained by the server, and b) the value of the property is\n   maintained by the client, but the server performs syntax checking on\n   submitted values. All instances of a given live property MUST comply\n   with the definition associated with that property name.  A dead\n   property has its syntax and semantics enforced by the client; the\n   server merely records the value of the property verbatim.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Existing Metadata Proposals\">\n<t>\n   Properties have long played an essential role in the maintenance of\n   large document repositories, and many current proposals contain some\n   notion of a property, or discuss web metadata more generally.  These\n   include PICS <xref target=\"REC-PICS\" />, PICS-NG, XML, Web Collections, and several\n   proposals on representing relationships within HTML. Work on PICS-NG\n   and Web Collections has been subsumed by the Resource Description\n   Framework (RDF) metadata activity of the World Wide Web Consortium.\n   RDF consists of a network-based data model and an XML representation\n   of that model.\n</t><t>\n   Some proposals come from a digital library perspective.  These\n   include the Dublin Core <xref target=\"RFC2413\" /> metadata set and the Warwick\n   Framework <xref target=\"WF\" />, a container architecture for different metadata\n   schemas.  The literature includes many examples of metadata,\n   including MARC <xref target=\"USMARC\" />, a bibliographic metadata format, and a\n   technical report bibliographic format employed by the Dienst system\n   <xref target=\"RFC1807\" />. Additionally, the proceedings from the first IEEE Metadata\n   conference describe many community-specific metadata sets.\n</t><t>\n   Participants of the 1996 Metadata II Workshop in Warwick, UK <xref target=\"WF\" />,\n   noted that \"new metadata sets will develop as the networked\n   infrastructure matures\" and \"different communities will propose,\n   design, and be responsible for different types of metadata.\" These\n   observations can be corroborated by noting that many community-\n   specific sets of metadata already exist, and there is significant\n   motivation for the development of new forms of metadata as many\n   communities increasingly make their data available in digital form,\n   requiring a metadata format to assist data location and cataloging.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Properties and HTTP Headers\">\n<t>\n   Properties already exist, in a limited sense, in HTTP message\n   headers.  However, in distributed authoring environments a relatively\n   large number of properties are needed to describe the state of a\n   resource, and setting/returning them all through HTTP headers is\n   inefficient.  Thus a mechanism is needed which allows a principal to\n   identify a set of properties in which the principal is interested and\n   to set or retrieve just those properties.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Property Values\">\n<t>\n   The value of a property when expressed in XML MUST be well formed.\n</t><t>\n   XML has been chosen because it is a flexible, self-describing,\n   structured data format that supports rich schema definitions, and\n   because of its support for multiple character sets.  XML's self-\n   describing nature allows any property's value to be extended by\n   adding new elements.  Older clients will not break when they\n   encounter extensions because they will still have the data specified\n   in the original schema and will ignore elements they do not\n   understand.  XML's support for multiple character sets allows any\n   human-readable property to be encoded and read in a character set\n   familiar to the user.  XML's support for multiple human languages,\n   using the \"xml:lang\" attribute, handles cases where the same\n   character set is employed by multiple human languages.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Property Names\">\n<t>\n   A property name is a universally unique identifier that is associated\n   with a schema that provides information about the syntax and\n   semantics of the property.\n</t><t>\n   Because a property's name is universally unique, clients can depend\n   upon consistent behavior for a particular property across multiple\n   resources, on the same and across different servers, so long as that\n   property is \"live\" on the resources in question, and the\n   implementation of the live property is faithful to its definition.\n</t><t>\n   The XML namespace mechanism, which is based on URIs <xref target=\"RFC2396\" />, is\n   used to name properties because it prevents namespace collisions and\n   provides for varying degrees of administrative control.\n</t><t>\n   The property namespace is flat; that is, no hierarchy of properties\n   is explicitly recognized.  Thus, if a property A and a property A/B\n   exist on a resource, there is no recognition of any relationship\n   between the two properties.  It is expected that a separate\n   specification will eventually be produced which will address issues\n   relating to hierarchical properties.\n</t><t>\n   Finally, it is not possible to define the same property twice on a\n   single resource, as this would cause a collision in the resource's\n   property namespace.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Media Independent Links\">\n<t>\n   Although HTML resources support links to other resources, the Web\n   needs more general support for links between resources of any media\n   type (media types are also known as MIME types, or content types).\n   WebDAV provides such links. A WebDAV link is a special type of\n   property value, formally defined in section 12.4, that allows typed\n   connections to be established between resources of any media type.\n   The property value consists of source and destination Uniform\n   Resource Identifiers (URIs); the property name identifies the link\n   type.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Collections of Web Resources\">\n<t>\n   This section provides a description of a new type of Web resource,\n   the collection, and discusses its interactions with the HTTP URL\n   namespace. The purpose of a collection resource is to model\n   collection-like objects (e.g., file system directories) within a\n   server's namespace.\n</t><t>\n   All DAV compliant resources MUST support the HTTP URL namespace model\n   specified herein.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"HTTP URL Namespace Model\">\n<t>\n   The HTTP URL namespace is a hierarchical namespace where the\n   hierarchy is delimited with the \"/\" character.\n</t><t>\n   An HTTP URL namespace is said to be consistent if it meets the\n   following conditions: for every URL in the HTTP hierarchy there\n   exists a collection that contains that URL as an internal member.\n   The root, or top-level collection of the namespace under\n   consideration is exempt from the previous rule.\n</t><t>\n   Neither HTTP/1.1 nor WebDAV require that the entire HTTP URL\n   namespace be consistent.  However, certain WebDAV methods are\n   prohibited from producing results that cause namespace\n   inconsistencies.\n</t><t>\n   Although implicit in <xref target=\"RFC2068\" /> and <xref target=\"RFC2396\" />, any resource, including\n   collection resources, MAY be identified by more than one URI. For\n   example, a resource could be identified by multiple HTTP URLs.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n\n<section title=\"Collection Resources\">\n<t>\n   A collection is a resource whose state consists of at least a list of\n   internal member URIs and a set of properties, but which may have\n   additional state such as entity bodies returned by GET.  An internal\n   member URI MUST be immediately relative to a base URI of the\n   collection.  That is, the internal member URI is equal to a\n   containing collection's URI plus an additional segment for non-\n   collection resources, or additional segment plus trailing slash \"/\"\n   for collection resources, where segment is defined in section 3.3 of\n   <xref target=\"RFC2396\" />.\n</t><t>\n   Any given internal member URI MUST only belong to the collection\n   once, i.e., it is illegal to have multiple instances of the same URI\n   in a collection.  Properties defined on collections behave exactly as\n   do properties on non-collection resources.\n</t><t>\n   For all WebDAV compliant resources A and B, identified by URIs U and\n   V, for which U is immediately relative to V, B MUST be a collection\n   that has U as an internal member URI. So, if the resource with URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/blah is WebDAV compliant and if the resource with\n   URL http://foo.com/bar/ is WebDAV compliant then the resource with\n   URL http://foo.com/bar/ must be a collection and must contain URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/blah as an internal member.\n</t><t>\n   Collection resources MAY list the URLs of non-WebDAV compliant\n   children in the HTTP URL namespace hierarchy as internal members but\n   are not required to do so. For example, if the resource with URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/blah is not WebDAV compliant and the URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/ identifies a collection then URL\n   http://foo.com/bar/blah may or may not be an internal member of the\n   collection with URL http://foo.com/bar/.\n</t><t>\n   If a WebDAV compliant resource has no WebDAV compliant children in\n   the HTTP URL namespace hierarchy then the WebDAV compliant resource\n   is not required to be a collection.\n</t><t>\n   There is a standing convention that when a collection is referred to\n   by its name without a trailing slash, the trailing slash is\n   automatically appended.  Due to this, a resource may accept a URI\n   without a trailing \"/\" to point to a collection. In this case it\n   SHOULD return a content-location header in the response pointing to\n   the URI ending with the \"/\".  For example, if a client invokes a\n   method on http://foo.bar/blah (no trailing slash), the resource\n   http://foo.bar/blah/ (trailing slash) may respond as if the operation\n   were invoked on it, and should return a content-location header with\n   http://foo.bar/blah/ in it.  In general clients SHOULD use the \"/\"\n   form of collection names.\n</t><t>\n   A resource MAY be a collection but not be WebDAV compliant.  That is,\n   the resource may comply with all the rules set out in this\n   specification regarding how a collection is to behave without\n   necessarily supporting all methods that a WebDAV compliant resource\n   is required to support.  In such a case the resource may return the\n   DAV:resourcetype property with the value DAV:collection but MUST NOT\n   return a DAV header containing the value \"1\" on an OPTIONS response.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Creation and Retrieval of Collection Resources\">\n<t>\n   This document specifies the MKCOL method to create new collection\n   resources, rather than using the existing HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST\n   method, for the following reasons:\n</t><t>\n   In HTTP/1.1, the PUT method is defined to store the request body at\n   the location specified by the Request-URI.  While a description\n   format for a collection can readily be constructed for use with PUT,\n   the implications of sending such a description to the server are\n   undesirable.  For example, if a description of a collection that\n   omitted some existing resources were PUT to a server, this might be\n   interpreted as a command to remove those members.  This would extend\n   PUT to perform DELETE functionality, which is undesirable since it\n   changes the semantics of PUT, and makes it difficult to control\n   DELETE functionality with an access control scheme based on methods.\n</t><t>\n   While the POST method is sufficiently open-ended that a \"create a\n   collection\" POST command could be constructed, this is undesirable\n   because it would be difficult to separate access control for\n   collection creation from other uses of POST.\n</t><t>\n   The exact definition of the behavior of GET and PUT on collections is\n   defined later in this document.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Source Resources and Output Resources\">\n<t>\n   For many resources, the entity returned by a GET method exactly\n   matches the persistent state of the resource, for example, a GIF file\n   stored on a disk.  For this simple case, the URI at which a resource\n   is accessed is identical to the URI at which the source (the\n   persistent state) of the resource is accessed.  This is also the case\n   for HTML source files that are not processed by the server prior to\n   transmission.\n</t><t>\n   However, the server can sometimes process HTML resources before they\n   are transmitted as a return entity body.  For example, a server-\n   side-include directive within an HTML file might instruct a server to\n   replace the directive with another value, such as the current date.\n   In this case, what is returned by GET (HTML plus date) differs from\n   the persistent state of the resource (HTML plus directive).\n   Typically there is no way to access the HTML resource containing the\n   unprocessed directive.\n</t><t>\n   Sometimes the entity returned by GET is the output of a data-\n   producing process that is described by one or more source resources\n   (that may not even have a location in the URI namespace).  A single\n   data-producing process may dynamically generate the state of a\n   potentially large number of output resources.  An example of this is\n   a CGI script that describes a \"finger\" gateway process that maps part\n   of the namespace of a server into finger requests, such as\n   http://www.foo.bar.org/finger_gateway/user@host.\n</t><t>\n   In the absence of distributed authoring capabilities, it is\n   acceptable to have no mapping of source resource(s) to the URI\n   namespace. In fact, preventing access to the source resource(s) has\n   desirable security benefits.  However, if remote editing of the\n   source resource(s) is desired, the source resource(s) should be given\n   a location in the URI namespace.  This source location should not be\n   one of the locations at which the generated output is retrievable,\n   since in general it is impossible for the server to differentiate\n   requests for source resources from requests for process output\n   resources.  There is often a many-to-many relationship between source\n   resources and output resources.\n</t><t>\n   On WebDAV compliant servers the URI of the source resource(s) may be\n   stored in a link on the output resource with type DAV:source (see\n   section 13.10 for a description of the source link property).\n   Storing the source URIs in links on the output resources places the\n   burden of discovering the source on the authoring client.  Note that\n   the value of a source link is not guaranteed to point to the correct\n   source.  Source links may break or incorrect values may be entered.\n   Also note that not all servers will allow the client to set the\n   source link value.  For example a server which generates source links\n   on the fly for its CGI files will most likely not allow a client to\n   set the source link value.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n\n<section title=\"Locking\">\n<t>\n   The ability to lock a resource provides a mechanism for serializing\n   access to that resource.  Using a lock, an authoring client can\n   provide a reasonable guarantee that another principal will not modify\n   a resource while it is being edited.  In this way, a client can\n   prevent the \"lost update\" problem.\n</t><t>\n   This specification allows locks to vary over two client-specified\n   parameters, the number of principals involved (exclusive vs. shared)\n   and the type of access to be granted. This document defines locking\n   for only one access type, write. However, the syntax is extensible,\n   and permits the eventual specification of locking for other access\n   types.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"Exclusive Vs. Shared Locks\">\n<t>\n   The most basic form of lock is an exclusive lock.  This is a lock\n   where the access right in question is only granted to a single\n   principal.  The need for this arbitration results from a desire to\n   avoid having to merge results.\n</t><t>\n   However, there are times when the goal of a lock is not to exclude\n   others from exercising an access right but rather to provide a\n   mechanism for principals to indicate that they intend to exercise\n   their access rights.  Shared locks are provided for this case.  A\n   shared lock allows multiple principals to receive a lock.  Hence any\n   principal with appropriate access can get the lock.\n</t><t>\n   With shared locks there are two trust sets that affect a resource.\n   The first trust set is created by access permissions.  Principals who\n   are trusted, for example, may have permission to write to the\n   resource.  Among those who have access permission to write to the\n   resource, the set of principals who have taken out a shared lock also\n   must trust each other, creating a (typically) smaller trust set\n   within the access permission write set.\n</t><t>\n   Starting with every possible principal on the Internet, in most\n   situations the vast majority of these principals will not have write\n   access to a given resource.  Of the small number who do have write\n   access, some principals may decide to guarantee their edits are free\n   from overwrite conflicts by using exclusive write locks.  Others may\n   decide they trust their collaborators will not overwrite their work\n   (the potential set of collaborators being the set of principals who\n   have write permission) and use a shared lock, which informs their\n   collaborators that a principal may be working on the resource.\n</t><t>\n   The WebDAV extensions to HTTP do not need to provide all of the\n   communications paths necessary for principals to coordinate their\n   activities.  When using shared locks, principals may use any out of\n   band communication channel to coordinate their work (e.g., face-to-\n   face interaction, written notes, post-it notes on the screen,\n   telephone conversation, Email, etc.)  The intent of a shared lock is\n   to let collaborators know who else may be working on a resource.\n</t><t>\n   Shared locks are included because experience from web distributed\n   authoring systems has indicated that exclusive locks are often too\n   rigid.  An exclusive lock is used to enforce a particular editing\n   process: take out an exclusive lock, read the resource, perform\n   edits, write the resource, release the lock.  This editing process\n   has the problem that locks are not always properly released, for\n   example when a program crashes, or when a lock owner leaves without\n   unlocking a resource.  While both timeouts and administrative action\n   can be used to remove an offending lock, neither mechanism may be\n   available when needed; the timeout may be long or the administrator\n   may not be available.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Required Support\">\n<t>\n   A WebDAV compliant server is not required to support locking in any\n   form.  If the server does support locking it may choose to support\n   any combination of exclusive and shared locks for any access types.\n</t><t>\n   The reason for this flexibility is that locking policy strikes to the\n   very heart of the resource management and versioning systems employed\n   by various storage repositories.  These repositories require control\n   over what sort of locking will be made available.  For example, some\n   repositories only support shared write locks while others only\n   provide support for exclusive write locks while yet others use no\n   locking at all.  As each system is sufficiently different to merit\n   exclusion of certain locking features, this specification leaves\n   locking as the sole axis of negotiation within WebDAV.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Lock Tokens\">\n<t>\n   A lock token is a type of state token, represented as a URI, which\n   identifies a particular lock.  A lock token is returned by every\n   successful LOCK operation in the lockdiscovery property in the\n   response body, and can also be found through lock discovery on a\n   resource.\n</t><t>\n   Lock token URIs MUST be unique across all resources for all time.\n   This uniqueness constraint allows lock tokens to be submitted across\n   resources and servers without fear of confusion.\n</t><t>\n   This specification provides a lock token URI scheme called\n   opaquelocktoken that meets the uniqueness requirements.  However\n   resources are free to return any URI scheme so long as it meets the\n   uniqueness requirements.\n</t><t>\n   Having a lock token provides no special access rights. Anyone can\n   find out anyone else's lock token by performing lock discovery.\n   Locks MUST be enforced based upon whatever authentication mechanism\n   is used by the server, not based on the secrecy of the token values.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"opaquelocktoken Lock Token URI Scheme\">\n<t>\n   The opaquelocktoken URI scheme is designed to be unique across all\n   resources for all time.  Due to this uniqueness quality, a client may\n   submit an opaque lock token in an If header on a resource other than\n   the one that returned it.\n</t><t>\n   All resources MUST recognize the opaquelocktoken scheme and, at\n   minimum, recognize that the lock token does not refer to an\n   outstanding lock on the resource.\n</t><t>\n   In order to guarantee uniqueness across all resources for all time\n   the opaquelocktoken requires the use of the Universal Unique\n   Identifier (UUID) mechanism, as described in <xref target=\"ISO-11578\" />.\n</t><t>\n   Opaquelocktoken generators, however, have a choice of how they create\n   these tokens.  They can either generate a new UUID for every lock\n   token they create or they can create a single UUID  and then add\n   extension characters.  If the second method is selected then the\n   program generating the extensions MUST guarantee that the same\n   extension will never be used twice with the associated UUID.\n</t><t>\n   OpaqueLockToken-URI = \"opaquelocktoken:\" UUID [Extension]  ; The UUID\n   production is the string representation of a UUID, as defined in\n   <xref target=\"ISO-11578\" />. Note that white space (LWS) is not allowed between\n   elements of this production.\n</t><t>\n   Extension = path  ; path is defined in section 3.2.1 of RFC 2068\n   <xref target=\"RFC2068\" />\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"Node Field Generation Without the IEEE 802 Address\">\n<t>\n   UUIDs, as defined in <xref target=\"ISO-11578\" />, contain a \"node\" field that\n   contains one of the IEEE 802 addresses for the server machine.  As\n   noted in section 17.8, there are several security risks associated\n   with exposing a machine's IEEE 802 address. This section provides an\n   alternate mechanism for generating the \"node\" field of a UUID which\n   does not employ an IEEE 802 address.  WebDAV servers MAY use this\n   algorithm for creating the node field when generating UUIDs.  The\n   text in this section is originally from an Internet-Draft by Paul\n   Leach and Rich Salz, who are noted here to properly attribute their\n   work.\n</t><t>\n   The ideal solution is to obtain a 47 bit cryptographic quality random\n   number, and use it as the low 47 bits of the node ID, with the most\n   significant bit of the first octet of the node ID set to 1.  This bit\n   is the unicast/multicast bit, which will never be set in IEEE 802\n   addresses obtained from network cards; hence, there can never be a\n   conflict between UUIDs generated by machines with and without network\n   cards.\n</t><t>\n   If a system does not have a primitive to generate cryptographic\n   quality random numbers, then in most systems there are usually a\n   fairly large number of sources of randomness available from which one\n   can be generated. Such sources are system specific, but often\n   include:\n</t><t><list style=\"symbols\">\n     <t>the percent of memory in use</t>\n     <t>the size of main memory in bytes</t>\n     <t>the amount of free main memory in bytes</t>\n     <t>the size of the paging or swap file in bytes</t>\n     <t>free bytes of paging or swap file</t>\n     <t>the total size of user virtual address space in bytes</t>\n     <t>the total available user address space bytes</t>\n     <t>the size of boot disk drive in bytes</t>\n     <t>the free disk space on boot drive in bytes</t>\n     <t>the current time</t>\n     <t>the amount of time since the system booted</t>\n     <t>the individual sizes of files in various system directories</t>\n     <t>the creation, last read, and modification times of files in\n       various system directories</t>\n     <t>the utilization factors of various system resources (heap, etc.)</t>\n     <t>current mouse cursor position</t>\n     <t>current caret position</t>\n     <t>current number of running processes, threads</t>\n     <t>handles or IDs of the desktop window and the active window</t>\n     <t>the value of stack pointer of the caller</t>\n     <t>the process and thread ID of caller</t>\n     <t>various processor architecture specific performance counters\n       (instructions executed, cache misses, TLB misses)</t>\n</list></t><t>\n   (Note that it is precisely the above kinds of sources of randomness\n   that are used to seed cryptographic quality random number generators\n   on systems without special hardware for their construction.)\n</t><t>\n   In addition, items such as the computer's name and the name of the\n   operating system, while not strictly speaking random, will help\n   differentiate the results from those obtained by other systems.\n</t><t>\n   The exact algorithm to generate a node ID using these data is system\n   specific, because both the data available and the functions to obtain\n   them are often very system specific. However, assuming that one can\n   concatenate all the values from the randomness sources into a buffer,\n   and that a cryptographic hash function such as MD5 is available, then\n   any 6 bytes of the MD5 hash of the buffer, with the multicast bit\n   (the high bit of the first byte) set will be an appropriately random\n   node ID.\n</t><t>\n   Other hash functions, such as SHA-1, can also be used. The only\n   requirement is that the result be suitably random _ in the sense that\n   the outputs from a set uniformly distributed inputs are themselves\n   uniformly distributed, and that a single bit change in the input can\n   be expected to cause half of the output bits to change.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Lock Capability Discovery\">\n<t>\n   Since server lock support is optional, a client trying to lock a\n   resource on a server can either try the lock and hope for the best,\n   or perform some form of discovery to determine what lock capabilities\n   the server supports.  This is known as lock capability discovery.\n   Lock capability discovery differs from discovery of supported access\n   control types, since there may be access control types without\n   corresponding lock types.  A client can determine what lock types the\n   server supports by retrieving the supportedlock property.\n</t><t>\n   Any DAV compliant resource that supports the LOCK method MUST support\n   the supportedlock property.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Active Lock Discovery\">\n<t>\n   If another principal locks a resource that a principal wishes to\n   access, it is useful for the second principal to be able to find out\n   who the first principal is.  For this purpose the lockdiscovery\n   property is provided.  This property lists all outstanding locks,\n   describes their type, and where available, provides their lock token.\n</t><t>\n   Any DAV compliant resource that supports the LOCK method MUST support\n   the lockdiscovery property.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Usage Considerations\">\n<t>\n   Although the locking mechanisms specified here provide some help in\n   preventing lost updates, they cannot guarantee that updates will\n   never be lost.  Consider the following scenario:\n</t><t>\n   Two clients A and B are interested in editing the resource '\n   index.html'.  Client A is an HTTP client rather than a WebDAV client,\n   and so does not know how to perform locking.\n</t><t>\n   Client A doesn't lock the document, but does a GET and begins\n   editing.\n</t><t>\n   Client B does LOCK, performs a GET and begins editing.\n</t><t>\n   Client B finishes editing, performs a PUT, then an UNLOCK.\n</t><t>\n   Client A performs a PUT, overwriting and losing all of B's changes.\n</t><t>\n   There are several reasons why the WebDAV protocol itself cannot\n   prevent this situation.  First, it cannot force all clients to use\n   locking because it must be compatible with HTTP clients that do not\n   comprehend locking.  Second, it cannot require servers to support\n   locking because of the variety of repository implementations, some of\n   which rely on reservations and merging rather than on locking.\n   Finally, being stateless, it cannot enforce a sequence of operations\n   like LOCK / GET / PUT / UNLOCK.\n</t><t>\n   WebDAV servers that support locking can reduce the likelihood that\n   clients will accidentally overwrite each other's changes by requiring\n   clients to lock resources before modifying them.  Such servers would\n   effectively prevent HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 clients from modifying\n   resources.\n</t><t>\n   WebDAV clients can be good citizens by using a lock / retrieve /\n   write /unlock sequence of operations (at least by default) whenever\n   they interact with a WebDAV server that supports locking.\n</t><t>\n   HTTP 1.1 clients can be good citizens, avoiding overwriting other\n   clients' changes, by using entity tags in If-Match headers with any\n   requests that would modify resources.\n</t><t>\n   Information managers may attempt to prevent overwrites by\n   implementing client-side procedures requiring locking before\n   modifying WebDAV resources.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Write Lock\">\n<t>\n   This section describes the semantics specific to the write lock type.\n   The write lock is a specific instance of a lock type, and is the only\n   lock type described in this specification.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"Methods Restricted by Write Locks\">\n<t>\n   A write lock MUST prevent a principal without the lock from\n   successfully executing a PUT, POST, PROPPATCH, LOCK, UNLOCK, MOVE,\n   DELETE, or MKCOL on the locked resource.  All other current methods,\n   GET in particular, function independently of the lock.\n</t><t>\n   Note, however, that as new methods are created it will be necessary\n   to specify how they interact with a write lock.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Write Locks and Lock Tokens\">\n<t>\n   A successful request for an exclusive or shared write lock MUST\n   result in the generation of a unique lock token associated with the\n   requesting principal.  Thus if five principals have a shared write\n   lock on the same resource there will be five lock tokens, one for\n   each principal.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Write Locks and Properties\">\n<t>\n   While those without a write lock may not alter a property on a\n   resource it is still possible for the values of live properties to\n   change, even while locked, due to the requirements of their schemas.\n   Only dead properties and live properties defined to respect locks are\n   guaranteed not to change while write locked.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Write Locks and Null Resources\">\n<t>\n   It is possible to assert a write lock on a null resource in order to\n   lock the name.\n</t><t>\n   A write locked null resource, referred to as a lock-null resource,\n   MUST respond with a 404 (Not Found) or 405 (Method Not Allowed) to\n   any HTTP/1.1 or DAV methods except for PUT, MKCOL, OPTIONS, PROPFIND,\n   LOCK, and UNLOCK.  A lock-null resource MUST appear as a member of\n   its parent collection.  Additionally the lock-null resource MUST have\n   defined on it all mandatory DAV properties.  Most of these\n   properties, such as all the get* properties, will have no value as a\n   lock-null resource does not support the GET method.  Lock-Null\n   resources MUST have defined values for lockdiscovery and\n   supportedlock properties.\n</t><t>\n   Until a method such as PUT or MKCOL is successfully executed on the\n   lock-null resource the resource MUST stay in the lock-null state.\n   However, once a PUT or MKCOL is successfully executed on a lock-null\n   resource the resource ceases to be in the lock-null state.\n</t><t>\n   If the resource is unlocked, for any reason, without a PUT, MKCOL, or\n   similar method having been successfully executed upon it then the\n   resource MUST return to the null state.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Write Locks and Collections\">\n<t>\n   A write lock on a collection, whether created by a \"Depth: 0\" or\n   \"Depth: infinity\" lock request, prevents the addition or removal of\n   member URIs of the collection by non-lock owners.  As a consequence,\n   when a principal issues a PUT or POST request to create a new\n   resource under a URI which needs to be an internal member of a write\n   locked collection to maintain HTTP namespace consistency, or issues a\n   DELETE to remove a resource which has a URI which is an existing\n   internal member URI of a write locked collection, this request MUST\n   fail if the principal does not have a write lock on the collection.\n</t><t>\n   However, if a write lock request is issued to a collection containing\n   member URIs identifying resources that are currently locked in a\n   manner which conflicts with the write lock, the request MUST fail\n   with a 423 (Locked) status code.\n</t><t>\n   If a lock owner causes the URI of a resource to be added as an\n   internal member URI of a locked collection then the new resource MUST\n   be automatically added to the lock.  This is the only mechanism that\n</t><t>\n   allows a resource to be added to a write lock.  Thus, for example, if\n   the collection /a/b/ is write locked and the resource /c is moved to\n   /a/b/c then resource /a/b/c will be added to the write lock.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Write Locks and the If Request Header\">\n<t>\n   If a user agent is not required to have knowledge about a lock when\n   requesting an operation on a locked resource, the following scenario\n   might occur.  Program A, run by User A, takes out a write lock on a\n   resource.  Program B, also run by User A, has no knowledge of the\n   lock taken out by Program A, yet performs a PUT to the locked\n   resource.  In this scenario, the PUT succeeds because locks are\n   associated with a principal, not a program, and thus program B,\n   because it is acting with principal A's credential, is allowed to\n   perform the PUT.  However, had program B known about the lock, it\n   would not have overwritten the resource, preferring instead to\n   present a dialog box describing the conflict to the user.  Due to\n   this scenario, a mechanism is needed to prevent different programs\n   from accidentally ignoring locks taken out by other programs with the\n   same authorization.\n</t><t>\n   In order to prevent these collisions a lock token MUST be submitted\n   by an authorized principal in the If header for all locked resources\n   that a method may interact with or the method MUST fail.  For\n   example, if a resource is to be moved and both the source and\n   destination are locked then two lock tokens must be submitted, one\n   for the source and the other for the destination.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"Example - Write Lock\">\n<figure><preamble>\n   >>Request</preamble>\n<artwork><![CDATA[\n   COPY /~fielding/index.html HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.ics.uci.edu\n   Destination: http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html\n   If: <http://www.ics.uci.edu/users/f/fielding/index.html>\n       (<opaquelocktoken:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6>)\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<figure><preamble>\n   >>Response</preamble>\n<artwork><![CDATA[\n   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<t>\n   In this example, even though both the source and destination are\n   locked, only one lock token must be submitted, for the lock on the\n   destination.  This is because the source resource is not modified by\n   a COPY, and hence unaffected by the write lock. In this example, user\n   agent authentication has previously occurred via a mechanism outside\n   the scope of the HTTP protocol, in the underlying transport layer.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Write Locks and COPY/MOVE\">\n<t>\n   A COPY method invocation MUST NOT duplicate any write locks active on\n   the source.  However, as previously noted, if the COPY copies the\n   resource into a collection that is locked with \"Depth: infinity\",\n   then the resource will be added to the lock.\n</t><t>\n   A successful MOVE request on a write locked resource MUST NOT move\n   the write lock with the resource. However, the resource is subject to\n   being added to an existing lock at the destination, as specified in\n   section 7.5. For example, if the MOVE makes the resource a child of a\n   collection that is locked with \"Depth: infinity\", then the resource\n   will be added to that collection's lock. Additionally, if a resource\n   locked with \"Depth: infinity\" is moved to a destination that is\n   within the scope of the same lock (e.g., within the namespace tree\n   covered by the lock), the moved resource will again be a added to the\n   lock. In both these examples, as specified in section 7.6, an If\n   header must be submitted containing a lock token for both the source\n   and destination.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Refreshing Write Locks\">\n<t>\n   A client MUST NOT submit the same write lock request twice.  Note\n   that a client is always aware it is resubmitting the same lock\n   request because it must include the lock token in the If header in\n   order to make the request for a resource that is already locked.\n</t><t>\n   However, a client may submit a LOCK method with an If header but\n   without a body.  This form of LOCK MUST only be used to \"refresh\" a\n   lock.  Meaning, at minimum, that any timers associated with the lock\n   MUST be re-set.\n</t><t>\n   A server may return a Timeout header with a lock refresh that is\n   different than the Timeout header returned when the lock was\n   originally requested.  Additionally clients may submit Timeout\n   headers of arbitrary value with their lock refresh requests.\n   Servers, as always, may ignore Timeout headers submitted by the\n   client.\n</t><t>\n   If an error is received in response to a refresh LOCK request the\n   client SHOULD assume that the lock was not refreshed.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"HTTP Methods for Distributed Authoring\">\n<t>\n   The following new HTTP methods use XML as a request and response\n   format.  All DAV compliant clients and resources MUST use XML parsers\n   that are compliant with <xref target=\"REC-XML\" />.  All XML used in either requests\n   or responses MUST be, at minimum, well formed.  If a server receives\n   ill-formed XML in a request it MUST reject the entire request with a\n   400 (Bad Request).  If a client receives ill-formed XML in a response\n   then it MUST NOT assume anything about the outcome of the executed\n   method and SHOULD treat the server as malfunctioning.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"PROPFIND\" anchor=\"METHOD_PROPFIND\">\n<t>\n   The PROPFIND method retrieves properties defined on the resource\n   identified by the Request-URI, if the resource does not have any\n   internal members, or on the resource identified by the Request-URI\n   and potentially its member resources, if the resource is a collection\n   that has internal member URIs.  All DAV compliant resources MUST\n   support the PROPFIND method and the propfind XML element (section\n   12.14) along with all XML elements defined for use with that element.\n</t><t>\n   A client may submit a Depth header with a value of \"0\", \"1\", or\n   \"infinity\" with a PROPFIND on a collection resource with internal\n   member URIs.  DAV compliant servers MUST support the \"0\", \"1\" and\n   \"infinity\" behaviors. By default, the PROPFIND method without a Depth\n   header MUST act as if a \"Depth: infinity\" header was included.\n</t><t>\n   A client may submit a propfind XML element in the body of the request\n   method describing what information is being requested.  It is\n   possible to request particular property values, all property values,\n   or a list of the names of the resource's properties.  A client may\n   choose not to submit a request body.  An empty PROPFIND request body\n   MUST be treated as a request for the names and values of all\n   properties.\n</t><t>\n   All servers MUST support returning a response of content type\n   text/xml or application/xml that contains a multistatus XML element\n   that describes the results of the attempts to retrieve the various\n   properties.\n</t><t>\n   If there is an error retrieving a property then a proper error result\n   MUST be included in the response.  A request to retrieve the value of\n   a property which does not exist is an error and MUST be noted, if the\n   response uses a multistatus XML element, with a response XML element\n   which contains a 404 (Not Found) status value.\n</t><t>\n   Consequently, the multistatus XML element for a collection resource\n   with member URIs MUST include a response XML element for each member\n   URI of the collection, to whatever depth was requested. Each response\n   XML element MUST contain an href XML element that gives the URI of\n   the resource on which the properties in the prop XML element are\n   defined.  Results for a PROPFIND on a collection resource with\n   internal member URIs are returned as a flat list whose order of\n   entries is not significant.\n</t><t>\n   In the case of allprop and propname, if a principal does not have the\n   right to know whether a particular property exists then the property\n   should be silently excluded from the response.\n</t><t>\n   The results of this method SHOULD NOT be cached.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"Example - Retrieving Named Properties\">\n<figure><preamble>\n   >>Request</preamble>\n<artwork><![CDATA[\n   PROPFIND  /file HTTP/1.1\n   Host: www.foo.bar\n   Content-type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\n   Content-Length: xxxx\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n     <D:prop xmlns:R=\"http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/\">\n          <R:bigbox/>\n          <R:author/>\n          <R:DingALing/>\n          <R:Random/>\n     </D:prop>\n   </D:propfind>\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<figure><preamble>\n   >>Response</preamble>\n<artwork><![CDATA[\n   HTTP/1.1 207 Multi-Status\n   Content-Type: text/xml; charset=\"utf-8\"\n   Content-Length: xxxx\n\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:multistatus xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n     <D:response>\n          <D:href>http://www.foo.bar/file</D:href>\n          <D:propstat>\n               <D:prop xmlns:R=\"http://www.foo.bar/boxschema/\">\n                    <R:bigbox>\n                         <R:BoxType>Box type A</R:BoxType>\n                    </R:bigbox>\n                    <R:author>\n                         <R:Name>J.J.

Properties defined on the resource may be\n   recomputed during PUT processing but are not otherwise affected.  For\n   example, if a server recognizes the content type of the request body,\n   it may be able to automatically extract information that could be\n   profitably exposed as properties.\n</t><t>\n   A PUT that would result in the creation of a resource without an\n   appropriately scoped parent collection MUST fail with a 409\n   (Conflict).\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"PUT for Collections\">\n<t>\n   As defined in the HTTP/1.1 specification <xref target=\"RFC2068\" />, the \"PUT method\n   requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied\n   Request-URI.\"  Since submission of an entity representing a\n   collection would implicitly encode creation and deletion of\n   resources, this specification intentionally does not define a\n   transmission format for creating a collection using PUT.  Instead,\n   the MKCOL method is defined to create collections.\n</t>\n<t>\n   When the PUT operation creates a new non-collection resource all\n   ancestors MUST already exist.  If all ancestors do not exist, the\n   method MUST fail with a 409 (Conflict) status code.  For example, if\n   resource /a/b/c/d.html is to be created and /a/b/c/ does not exist,\n   then the request must fail.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n\n<section title=\"COPY Method\" anchor=\"METHOD_COPY\">\n<t>\n   The COPY method creates a duplicate of the source resource,\n   identified by the Request-URI, in the destination resource,\n   identified by the URI in the Destination header.  The Destination\n   header MUST be present.  The exact behavior of the COPY method\n   depends on the type of the source resource.\n</t><t>\n   All WebDAV compliant resources MUST support the COPY method.\n   However, support for the COPY method does not guarantee the ability\n   to copy a resource. For example, separate programs may control\n   resources on the same server.  As a result, it may not be possible to\n   copy a resource to a location that appears to be on the same server.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"COPY for HTTP/1.1 resources\">\n<t>\n   When the source resource is not a collection the result of the COPY\n   method is the creation of a new resource at the destination whose\n   state and behavior match that of the source resource as closely as\n   possible.  After a successful COPY invocation, all properties on the\n   source resource MUST be duplicated on the destination resource,\n   subject to modifying headers and XML elements, following the\n   definition for copying properties.  Since the environment at the\n   destination may be different than at the source due to factors\n   outside the scope of control of the server, such as the absence of\n   resources required for correct operation, it may not be possible to\n   completely duplicate the behavior of the resource at the destination.\n   Subsequent alterations to the destination resource will not modify\n   the source resource.  Subsequent alterations to the source resource\n   will not modify the destination resource.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"COPY for Properties\">\n<t>\n   The following section defines how properties on a resource are\n   handled during a COPY operation.\n</t><t>\n   Live properties SHOULD be duplicated as identically behaving live\n   properties at the destination resource.  If a property cannot be\n   copied live, then its value MUST be duplicated, octet-for-octet, in\n   an identically named, dead property on the destination resource\n   subject to the effects of the propertybehavior XML element.\n</t><t>\n   The propertybehavior XML element can specify that properties are\n   copied on best effort, that all live properties must be successfully\n   copied or the method must fail, or that a specified list of live\n   properties must be successfully copied or the method must fail. The\n   propertybehavior XML element is defined in section 12.12.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"COPY for Collections\">\n<t>\n   The COPY method on a collection without a Depth header MUST act as if\n   a Depth header with value \"infinity\" was included.  A client may\n   submit a Depth header on a COPY on a collection with a value of \"0\"\n   or \"infinity\".  DAV compliant servers MUST support the \"0\" and\n   \"infinity\" Depth header behaviors.\n</t><t>\n   A COPY of depth infinity instructs that the collection resource\n   identified by the Request-URI is to be copied to the location\n   identified by the URI in the Destination header, and all its internal\n   member resources are to be copied to a location relative to it,\n   recursively through all levels of the collection hierarchy.\n</t><t>\n   A COPY of \"Depth: 0\" only instructs that the collection and its\n   properties but not resources identified by its internal member URIs,\n   are to be copied.\n</t><t>\n   Any headers included with a COPY MUST be applied in processing every\n   resource to be copied with the exception of the Destination header.\n</t><t>\n   The Destination header only specifies the destination URI for the\n   Request-URI. When applied to members of the collection identified by\n   the Request-URI the value of Destination is to be modified to reflect\n   the current location in the hierarchy.  So, if the Request- URI is\n   /a/ with Host header value http://fun.com/ and the Destination is\n   http://fun.com/b/ then when http://fun.com/a/c/d is processed it must\n   use a Destination of http://fun.com/b/c/d.\n</t><t>\n   When the COPY method has completed processing it MUST have created a\n   consistent namespace at the destination (see section 5.1 for the\n   definition of namespace consistency).  However, if an error occurs\n   while copying an internal collection, the server MUST NOT copy any\n   resources identified by members of this collection (i.e., the server\n   must skip this subtree), as this would create an inconsistent\n   namespace. After detecting an error, the COPY operation SHOULD try to\n   finish as much of the original copy operation as possible (i.e., the\n   server should still attempt to copy other subtrees and their members,\n   that are not descendents of an error-causing collection).  So, for\n   example, if an infinite depth copy operation is performed on\n   collection /a/, which contains collections /a/b/ and /a/c/, and an\n   error occurs copying /a/b/, an attempt should still be made to copy\n   /a/c/. Similarly, after encountering an error copying a non-\n   collection resource as part of an infinite depth copy, the server\n   SHOULD try to finish as much of the original copy operation as\n   possible.\n</t><t>\n   If an error in executing the COPY method occurs with a resource other\n   than the resource identified in the Request-URI then the response\n   MUST be a 207 (Multi-Status).\n</t><t>\n   The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code SHOULD NOT be returned in the\n   207 (Multi-Status) response from a COPY method.  These responses can\n   be safely omitted because the client will know that the progeny of a\n   resource could not be copied when the client receives an error for\n   the parent.  Additionally 201 (Created)/204 (No Content) status codes\n   SHOULD NOT be returned as values in 207 (Multi-Status) responses from\n   COPY methods.

All DAV compliant resources MUST support the MOVE\n   method.  However, support for the MOVE method does not guarantee the\n   ability to move a resource to a particular destination.\n</t><t>\n   For example, separate programs may actually control different sets of\n   resources on the same server.  Therefore, it may not be possible to\n   move a resource within a namespace that appears to belong to the same\n   server.\n</t><t>\n   If a resource exists at the destination, the destination resource\n   will be DELETEd as a side-effect of the MOVE operation, subject to\n   the restrictions of the Overwrite header.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"MOVE for Properties\">\n<t>\n   The behavior of properties on a MOVE, including the effects of the\n   propertybehavior XML element, MUST be the same as specified in\n   section 8.8.2.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"MOVE for Collections\">\n<t>\n   A MOVE with \"Depth: infinity\" instructs that the collection\n   identified by the Request-URI be moved to the URI specified in the\n   Destination header, and all resources identified by its internal\n   member URIs are to be moved to locations relative to it, recursively\n   through all levels of the collection hierarchy.\n</t><t>\n   The MOVE method on a collection MUST act as if a \"Depth: infinity\"\n   header was used on it.

As a result, a lock on a\n   resource MUST also lock the resource's properties.\n</t><t>\n   For collections, a lock also affects the ability to add or remove\n   members.

A successful result MUST return a\n   single lock token which represents all the resources that have been\n   locked.  If an UNLOCK is successfully executed on this token, all\n   associated resources are unlocked.  If the lock cannot be granted to\n   all resources, a 409 (Conflict) status code MUST be returned with a\n   response entity body containing a multistatus XML element describing\n   which resource(s) prevented the lock from being granted.

However,\n   the server is not required to honor or even consider these requests.\n   Clients MUST NOT submit a Timeout request header with any method\n   other than a LOCK method.\n</t><t>\n   A Timeout request header MUST contain at least one TimeType and may\n   contain multiple TimeType entries. The purpose of listing multiple\n   TimeType entries is to indicate multiple different values and value\n   types that are acceptable to the client.  The client lists the\n   TimeType entries in order of preference.\n</t><t>\n   Timeout response values MUST use a Second value, Infinite, or a\n   TimeType the client has indicated familiarity with.  The server may\n   assume a client is familiar with any TimeType submitted in a Timeout\n   header.\n</t><t>\n   The \"Second\" TimeType specifies the number of seconds that will\n   elapse between granting of the lock at the server, and the automatic\n   removal of the lock.  The timeout value for TimeType \"Second\" MUST\n   NOT be greater than 2^32-1.\n</t><t>\n   The timeout counter SHOULD be restarted any time an owner of the lock\n   sends a method to any member of the lock, including unsupported\n   methods, or methods which are unsuccessful.  However the lock MUST be\n   refreshed if a refresh LOCK method is successfully received.\n</t><t>\n   If the timeout expires then the lock may be lost.  Specifically, if\n   the server wishes to harvest the lock upon time-out, the server\n   SHOULD act as if an UNLOCK method was executed by the server on the\n   resource using the lock token of the timed-out lock, performed with\n   its override authority. Thus logs should be updated with the\n   disposition of the lock, notifications should be sent, etc., just as\n   they would be for an UNLOCK request.\n</t><t>\n   Servers are advised to pay close attention to the values submitted by\n   clients, as they will be indicative of the type of activity the\n   client intends to perform.  For example, an applet running in a\n   browser may need to lock a resource, but because of the instability\n   of the environment within which the applet is running, the applet may\n   be turned off without warning.  As a result, the applet is likely to\n   ask for a relatively small timeout value so that if the applet dies,\n   the lock can be quickly harvested.  However, a document management\n   system is likely to ask for an extremely long timeout because its\n   user may be planning on going off-line.\n</t><t>\n   A client MUST NOT assume that just because the time-out has expired\n   the lock has been lost.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n\n<section title=\"Status Code Extensions to HTTP/1.1\">\n<t>\n   The following status codes are added to those defined in HTTP/1.1\n   <xref target=\"RFC2068\" />.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"102 Processing\" anchor=\"STATUS_102\">\n<t>\n   The 102 (Processing) status code is an interim response used to\n   inform the client that the server has accepted the complete request,\n   but has not yet completed it.  This status code SHOULD only be sent\n   when the server has a reasonable expectation that the request will\n   take significant time to complete. As guidance, if a method is taking\n   longer than 20 seconds (a reasonable, but arbitrary value) to process\n   the server SHOULD return a 102 (Processing) response. The server MUST\n   send a final response after the request has been completed.\n</t><t>\n   Methods can potentially take a long period of time to process,\n   especially methods that support the Depth header.  In such cases the\n   client may time-out the connection while waiting for a response.

In this specification,\n   human-readable fields can be found either in the value of a property,\n   or in an error message returned in a response entity body.  In both\n   cases, the human-readable content is encoded using XML, which has\n   explicit provisions for character set tagging and encoding, and\n   requires that XML processors read XML elements encoded, at minimum,\n   using the UTF-8 <xref target=\"UTF-8\" /> encoding of the ISO 10646 multilingual plane.\n   XML examples in this specification demonstrate use of the charset\n   parameter of the Content-Type header, as defined in <xref target=\"RFC2376\" />, as\n   well as the XML \"encoding\" attribute, which together provide charset\n   identification information for MIME and XML processors.\n</t><t>\n   XML also provides a language tagging capability for specifying the\n   language of the contents of a particular XML element.  XML uses\n   either IANA registered language tags (see <xref target=\"RFC1766\" />) or ISO 639\n   language tags <xref target=\"ISO-639\" /> in the \"xml:lang\" attribute of an XML element\n   to identify the language of its content and attributes.\n</t><t>\n   WebDAV applications MUST support the character set tagging, character\n   set encoding, and the language tagging functionality of the XML\n   specification.  Implementors of WebDAV applications are strongly\n   encouraged to read \"XML Media Types\" <xref target=\"RFC2376\" /> for instruction on\n   which MIME media type to use for XML transport, and on use of the\n   charset parameter of the Content-Type header.\n</t><t>\n   Names used within this specification fall into three categories:\n   names of protocol elements such as methods and headers, names of XML\n   elements, and names of properties.  Naming of protocol elements\n   follows the precedent of HTTP, using English names encoded in USASCII\n   for methods and headers.  Since these protocol elements are not\n   visible to users, and are in fact simply long token identifiers, they\n   do not need to support encoding in multiple character sets.\n   Similarly, though the names of XML elements used in this\n   specification are English names encoded in UTF-8, these names are not\n   visible to the user, and hence do not need to support multiple\n   character set encodings.\n</t><t>\n   The name of a property defined on a resource is a URI.  Although some\n   applications (e.g., a generic property viewer) will display property\n   URIs directly to their users, it is expected that the typical\n   application will use a fixed set of properties, and will provide a\n   mapping from the property name URI to a human-readable field when\n   displaying the property name to a user.  It is only in the case where\n   the set of properties is not known ahead of time that an application\n   need display a property name URI to a user. We recommend that\n   applications provide human-readable property names wherever feasible.\n</t><t>\n   For error reporting, we follow the convention of HTTP/1.1 status\n   codes, including with each status code a short, English description\n   of the code (e.g., 423 (Locked)).  While the possibility exists that\n   a poorly crafted user agent would display this message to a user,\n   internationalized applications will ignore this message, and display\n   an appropriate message in the user's language and character set.\n</t><t>\n   Since interoperation of clients and servers does not require locale\n   information, this specification does not specify any mechanism for\n   transmission of this information.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Security Considerations\">\n<t>\n   This section is provided to detail issues concerning security\n   implications of which WebDAV applications need to be aware.\n</t><t>\n   All of the security considerations of HTTP/1.1 (discussed in\n   <xref target=\"RFC2068\" />) and XML (discussed in <xref target=\"RFC2376\" />) also apply to WebDAV. In\n   addition, the security risks inherent in remote authoring require\n   stronger authentication technology, introduce several new privacy\n   concerns, and may increase the hazards from poor server design.\n   These issues are detailed below.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"Authentication of Clients\">\n<t>\n   Due to their emphasis on authoring, WebDAV servers need to use\n   authentication technology to protect not just access to a network\n   resource, but the integrity of the resource as well.  Furthermore,\n   the introduction of locking functionality requires support for\n   authentication.\n</t><t>\n   A password sent in the clear over an insecure channel is an\n   inadequate means for protecting the accessibility and integrity of a\n   resource as the password may be intercepted.  Since Basic\n   authentication for HTTP/1.1 performs essentially clear text\n   transmission of a password, Basic authentication MUST NOT be used to\n   authenticate a WebDAV client to a server unless the connection is\n   secure. Furthermore, a WebDAV server MUST NOT send Basic\n   authentication credentials in a WWW-Authenticate header unless the\n   connection is secure.  Examples of secure connections include a\n   Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection employing a strong cipher\n   suite with mutual authentication of client and server, or a\n   connection over a network which is physically secure, for example, an\n   isolated network in a building with restricted access.\n</t><t>\n   WebDAV applications MUST support the Digest authentication scheme\n   <xref target=\"RFC2069\" />. Since Digest authentication verifies that both parties to\n   a communication know a shared secret, a password, without having to\n   send that secret in the clear, Digest authentication avoids the\n   security problems inherent in Basic authentication while providing a\n   level of authentication which is useful in a wide range of scenarios.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Denial of Service\">\n<t>\n   Denial of service attacks are of special concern to WebDAV servers.\n   WebDAV plus HTTP enables denial of service attacks on every part of a\n   system's resources.\n</t><t>\n   The underlying storage can be attacked by PUTting extremely large\n   files.\n</t><t>\n   Asking for recursive operations on large collections can attack\n   processing time.\n</t><t>\n   Making multiple pipelined requests on multiple connections can attack\n   network connections.\n</t><t>\n   WebDAV servers need to be aware of the possibility of a denial of\n   service attack at all levels.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Security through Obscurity\">\n<t>\n   WebDAV provides, through the PROPFIND method, a mechanism for listing\n   the member resources of a collection.  This greatly diminishes the\n   effectiveness of security or privacy techniques that rely only on the\n   difficulty of discovering the names of network resources.  Users of\n   WebDAV servers are encouraged to use access control techniques to\n   prevent unwanted access to resources, rather than depending on the\n   relative obscurity of their resource names.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Privacy Issues Connected to Locks\">\n<t>\n   When submitting a lock request a user agent may also submit an owner\n   XML field giving contact information for the person taking out the\n   lock (for those cases where a person, rather than a robot, is taking\n   out the lock). This contact information is stored in a lockdiscovery\n   property on the resource, and can be used by other collaborators to\n   begin negotiation over access to the resource.  However, in many\n   cases this contact information can be very private, and should not be\n   widely disseminated.  Servers SHOULD limit read access to the\n   lockdiscovery property as appropriate.  Furthermore, user agents\n   SHOULD provide control over whether contact information is sent at\n   all, and if contact information is sent, control over exactly what\n   information is sent.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Privacy Issues Connected to Properties\">\n<t>\n   Since property values are typically used to hold information such as\n   the author of a document, there is the possibility that privacy\n   concerns could arise stemming from widespread access to a resource's\n   property data.  To reduce the risk of inadvertent release of private\n   information via properties, servers are encouraged to develop access\n   control mechanisms that separate read access to the resource body and\n   read access to the resource's properties.  This allows a user to\n   control the dissemination of their property data without overly\n   restricting access to the resource's contents.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Reduction of Security due to Source Link\">\n<t>\n   HTTP/1.1 warns against providing read access to script code because\n   it may contain sensitive information.  Yet WebDAV, via its source\n   link facility, can potentially provide a URI for script resources so\n   they may be authored.  For HTTP/1.1, a server could reasonably\n   prevent access to source resources due to the predominance of read-\n   only access.  WebDAV, with its emphasis on authoring, encourages read\n   and write access to source resources, and provides the source link\n   facility to identify the source.  This reduces the security benefits\n   of eliminating access to source resources.  Users and administrators\n   of WebDAV servers should be very cautious when allowing remote\n   authoring of scripts, limiting read and write access to the source\n   resources to authorized principals.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Implications of XML External Entities\">\n<t>\n   XML supports a facility known as \"external entities\", defined in\n   section 4.2.2 of <xref target=\"REC-XML\" />, which instruct an XML processor to\n   retrieve and perform an inline include of XML located at a particular\n   URI. An external XML entity can be used to append or modify the\n   document type declaration (DTD) associated with an XML document.  An\n   external XML entity can also be used to include XML within the\n   content of an XML document.  For non-validating XML, such as the XML\n   used in this specification, including an external XML entity is not\n   required by <xref target=\"REC-XML\" />. However, <xref target=\"REC-XML\" /> does state that an XML\n   processor may, at its discretion, include the external XML entity.\n</t><t>\n   External XML entities have no inherent trustworthiness and are\n   subject to all the attacks that are endemic to any HTTP GET request.\n   Furthermore, it is possible for an external XML entity to modify the\n   DTD, and hence affect the final form of an XML document, in the worst\n   case significantly modifying its semantics, or exposing the XML\n   processor to the security risks discussed in <xref target=\"RFC2376\" />.  Therefore,\n   implementers must be aware that external XML entities should be\n   treated as untrustworthy.\n</t><t>\n   There is also the scalability risk that would accompany a widely\n   deployed application which made use of external XML entities.  In\n   this situation, it is possible that there would be significant\n   numbers of requests for one external XML entity, potentially\n   overloading any server which fields requests for the resource\n   containing the external XML entity.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Risks Connected with Lock Tokens\">\n<t>\n   This specification, in section 6.4, requires the use of Universal\n   Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) for lock tokens, in order to guarantee\n   their uniqueness across space and time.  UUIDs, as defined in [ISO-\n   11578], contain a \"node\" field which \"consists of the IEEE address,\n   usually the host address.  For systems with multiple IEEE 802 nodes,\n   any available node address can be used.\"  Since a WebDAV server will\n   issue many locks over its lifetime, the implication is that it will\n   also be publicly exposing its IEEE 802 address.\n</t><t>\n   There are several risks associated with exposure of IEEE 802\n   addresses.  Using the IEEE 802 address:\n</t>\n<t><list style=\"symbols\">\n   <t>It is possible to track the movement of hardware from subnet to\n   subnet.</t>\n\n   <t>It may be possible to identify the manufacturer of the hardware\n   running a WebDAV server.</t>\n\n   <t>It may be possible to determine the number of each type of computer\n   running WebDAV.</t>\n</list></t>\n<t>\n   Section 6.4.1 of this specification details an alternate mechanism\n   for generating the \"node\" field of a UUID without using an IEEE 802\n   address, which alleviates the risks associated with exposure of IEEE\n   802 addresses by using an alternate source of uniqueness.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"IANA Considerations\">\n<t>\n   This document defines two namespaces, the namespace of property\n   names, and the namespace of WebDAV-specific XML elements used within\n   property values.\n   URIs are used for both names, for several reasons. Assignment of a\n   URI does not require a request to a central naming authority, and\n   hence allow WebDAV property names and XML elements to be quickly\n   defined by any WebDAV user or application.  URIs also provide a\n   unique address space, ensuring that the distributed users of WebDAV\n   will not have collisions among the property names and XML elements\n   they create.\n</t><t>\n   This specification defines a distinguished set of property names and\n   XML elements that are understood by all WebDAV applications.  The\n   property names and XML elements in this specification are all derived\n   from the base URI DAV: by adding a suffix to this URI, for example,\n   DAV:creationdate for the \"creationdate\" property.\n</t><t>\n   This specification also defines a URI scheme for the encoding of lock\n   tokens, the opaquelocktoken URI scheme described in section 6.4.\n</t><t>\n   To ensure correct interoperation based on this specification, IANA\n   must reserve the URI namespaces starting with \"DAV:\" and with\n   \"opaquelocktoken:\" for use by this specification, its revisions, and\n   related WebDAV specifications.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Intellectual Property\">\n<t>\n   The following notice is copied from RFC 2026 <xref target=\"RFC2026\" />, section 10.4,\n   and describes the position of the IETF concerning intellectual\n   property claims made against this document.\n</t><t>\n   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any\n   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to\n   pertain to the implementation or use other technology described in\n   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights\n   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it\n   has made any effort to identify any such rights.

The first is to declare an XML element of the\n   form &lt;A>&lt;/A>.  The second is to declare an XML element of the form\n   &lt;A/>.  The two XML elements are semantically identical.\n</t><t>\n   It is a violation of the XML specification to use the &lt;A>&lt;/A> form if\n   the associated DTD declares the element to be EMPTY (e.g., &lt;!ELEMENT\n   A EMPTY>).  If such a statement is included, then the empty element\n   format, &lt;A/> must be used.  If the element is not declared to be\n   EMPTY, then either form &lt;A>&lt;/A> or &lt;A/> may be used for empty\n   elements.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Notes on Illegal XML Processing\">\n<t>\n   XML is a flexible data format that makes it easy to submit data that\n   appears legal but in fact is not.  The philosophy of \"Be flexible in\n   what you accept and strict in what you send\" still applies, but it\n   must not be applied inappropriately.  XML is extremely flexible in\n   dealing with issues of white space, element ordering, inserting new\n   elements, etc.  This flexibility does not require extension,\n   especially not in the area of the meaning of elements.\n</t><t>\n   There is no kindness in accepting illegal combinations of XML\n   elements.  At best it will cause an unwanted result and at worst it\n   can cause real damage.\n</t>\n\n<section title=\"Example - XML Syntax Error\">\n<t>\n   The following request body for a PROPFIND method is illegal.\n</t>\n<figure><artwork><![CDATA[\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n     <D:allprop/>\n     <D:propname/>\n   </D:propfind>\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<t>\n   The definition of the propfind element only allows for the allprop or\n   the propname element, not both.  Thus the above is an error and must\n   be responded to with a 400 (Bad Request).\n</t><t>\n   Imagine, however, that a server wanted to be \"kind\" and decided to\n   pick the allprop element as the true element and respond to it.  A\n   client running over a bandwidth limited line who intended to execute\n   a propname would be in for a big surprise if the server treated the\n   command as an allprop.\n</t><t>\n   Additionally, if a server were lenient and decided to reply to this\n   request, the results would vary randomly from server to server, with\n   some servers executing the allprop directive, and others executing\n   the propname directive. This reduces interoperability rather than\n   increasing it.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Example - Unknown XML Element\">\n<t>\n   The previous example was illegal because it contained two elements\n   that were explicitly banned from appearing together in the propfind\n   element.  However, XML is an extensible language, so one can imagine\n   new elements being defined for use with propfind.  Below is the\n   request body of a PROPFIND and, like the previous example, must be\n   rejected with a 400 (Bad Request) by a server that does not\n   understand the expired-props element.\n</t>\n<figure><artwork><![CDATA[\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"\n   xmlns:E=\"http://www.foo.bar/standards/props/\">\n     <E:expired-props/>\n   </D:propfind>\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<t>\n   To understand why a 400 (Bad Request) is returned let us look at the\n   request body as the server unfamiliar with expired-props sees it.\n</t>\n<figure><artwork><![CDATA[\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"\n               xmlns:E=\"http://www.foo.bar/standards/props/\">\n   </D:propfind>\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<t>\n   As the server does not understand the expired-props element,\n   according to the WebDAV-specific XML processing rules specified in\n   section 14, it must ignore it.  Thus the server sees an empty\n   propfind, which by the definition of the propfind element is illegal.\n</t><t>\n   Please note that had the extension been additive it would not\n   necessarily have resulted in a 400 (Bad Request).  For example,\n   imagine the following request body for a PROPFIND:\n</t>\n<figure><artwork><![CDATA[\n   <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?>\n   <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"\n               xmlns:E=\"http://www.foo.bar/standards/props/\">\n     <D:propname/>\n     <E:leave-out>*boss*</E:leave-out>\n   </D:propfind>\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<t>\n   The previous example contains the fictitious element leave-out. Its\n   purpose is to prevent the return of any property whose name matches\n   the submitted pattern.  If the previous example were submitted to a\n   server unfamiliar with leave-out, the only result would be that the\n   leave-out element would be ignored and a propname would be executed.\n</t>\n</section>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"XML Namespaces for WebDAV\">\n\n<section title=\"Introduction\">\n<t>\n   All DAV compliant systems MUST support the XML namespace extensions\n   as specified in <xref target=\"REC-XML-NAMES\" />.\n</t>\n</section>\n\n<section title=\"Meaning of Qualified Names\">\n<t>\n   [Note to the reader: This section does not appear in <xref target=\"REC-XML-NAMES\" />,\n   but is necessary to avoid ambiguity for WebDAV XML processors.]\n</t>\n<t>\n   WebDAV compliant XML processors MUST interpret a qualified name as a\n   URI constructed by appending the LocalPart to the namespace name URI.\n</t>\n<figure><artwork><![CDATA[\n   Example\n\n   <del:glider xmlns:del=\"http://www.del.jensen.org/\">\n     <del:glidername>\n          Johnny Updraft\n     </del:glidername>\n     <del:glideraccidents/>\n   </del:glider>\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<t>\n   In this example, the qualified element name \"del:glider\" is\n   interpreted as the URL \"http://www.del.jensen.org/glider\".\n</t>\n<figure><artwork><![CDATA[\n   <bar:glider xmlns:del=\"http://www.del.jensen.org/\">\n     <bar:glidername>\n          Johnny Updraft\n     </bar:glidername>\n     <bar:glideraccidents/>\n   </bar:glider>\n]]></artwork></figure>\n<t>\n   Even though this example is syntactically different from the previous\n   example, it is semantically identical.
