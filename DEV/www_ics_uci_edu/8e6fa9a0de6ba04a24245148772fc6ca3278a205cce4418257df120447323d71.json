Shouldn't machine counts and recounts\r\nof ballots produce repeatable, reliable results?</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">A: Many people have wondered why a computerized\r\nvote-counting system</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">would have any significant inaccuracies. Some\r\nhave publicly speculated that such variation must be the result of deliberate\r\nhuman action. Some people believe that computerized counts will always\r\nbe more accurate than human counts, because of inevitable \"human error.\"</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">However, computerized vote-counting systems\r\nare complex, prone to</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">several kinds of error. Well-designed vote-counting\r\nsystems minimize these errors. Some systems, particularly older systems,\r\nare not so well-designed,and are more prone to error. To illustrate this\r\nproblem, we will describe some reliability problems with the oldest type\r\nof computerized ballot still in use, the Vote-O-Matic(tm). This system\r\nwas once very popular and is still used in many places, including 15 Florida\r\ncounties: Broward, Collier, Dade, Duval, Highlands, Hillsborough, Indian\r\nRiver, Lee, Marion, Osceola, Palm Beach, Pasco, Pinellas, Sarasota, and\r\nSumpter.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The following describes reliability problems\r\nassociated with one phase of the elections process: gathering ballots and\r\nrunning them through readers. Problems may occur in other phases, included\r\nmaterials design and printing, polling place administration, voter education,\r\nand vote tally software. By focusing on this one phase, we do not imply\r\nthat the other phases are trivial. Conducting elections is demanding work,\r\nin all phases. Also, this paper focuses on errors. Elections frauds certainly\r\nhave arisen in the history of American politics, but to our knowledge no\r\nfraud has been alleged in the ballot counting process for this election.\r\nSome level of error is inevitable when counting Vote-O-Matic ballots, however.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">CPSR has been studying Vote-O-Matic-type vote\r\ncounting systems for over ten years. Experts, including CPSR's own project\r\npersonnel, have concluded that the Vote-O-Matic system has inherent accuracy\r\nlimitations. Furthermore,careful manual counting of Vote-O-Matic ballots\r\nshould always be more accurate than machine counts.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The Vote-O-Matic system uses as a ballot the\r\nHollerith punch card, also known as a \"computer card.\" This once-common\r\ncard is roughly 3\" by 7\", with small rectangular holes. For Vote-O-Matic\r\ncards, each hole in the card represents a vote for one candidate (or in\r\nfavor or against a ballot measure). The ballot is counted by feeding it,\r\nshort-side first, into a reader. (The card is made with one corner clipped,\r\nso that the correct end of the card is fed in first.) The reader has lights\r\nand sensors. When a hole passes over the sensor, light shines through,\r\nand the hole is read as a vote.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Hollerith cards were used for the 1890 census,\r\nand millions and millions of critical activities between then and the 1970's.\r\nThus, one might expect the Vote-O-Matic system to be extremely reliable.\r\nBut important differences between the standard Hollerith card and the Vote-O-Matic\r\ncard make the Vote-O-Matic far less stable and reliable. There are three\r\nmain problem areas:</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- ballots</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- ballot reader machines</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- what happens when a ballot reader reads a\r\nballot</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">* Ballots</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The ballots use essentially the same card size\r\nand hole positions that IBM adopted in 1924 soon after they bought Hollerith's\r\ncompany. However, the cards are not the same. Hollerith's approach was\r\nto punch a hole in a solid piece of paper. Vote-O-Matic cards are pre-punched.\r\nEach square \"chad\" is held in place by a small wad of paper fibers at each\r\ncorner. The vote then makes a hole by pushing the chad out with a round\r\nstylus. However, sometimes a chad will be partly punched out or will snag\r\non something and be pulled out, creating what is known as \"hanging chad.\"</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Hanging chad can be attached at one, two, or\r\nthree corners. Chad attached at one corner are usually torn off by the\r\ncard reader or in handling. Chad attached at two corners are also often\r\ntorn off, unless the two corners are on the side of the chad that is fed\r\nfirst into the card reader. Then, often,the chad will be forced back into\r\nthe hole, only to flap open again later. chad attached at three corners\r\nare also usually forced closed by the card reader. Handling the cards can\r\nalso change the status of hanging chad. Some studies have been done on\r\nchad, but there are many independent variable and complicating situations,\r\nso the preceding is a generalization.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">These pre-punched cards are also reportedly\r\nsensitive to changes humidity. The reasons have not, to our knowledge,\r\nbeen studied, but it is likely because the chad loses and gains moisture\r\nfaster than the bulk material. Thus taking a box of Vote-O-Matic cards\r\nfrom an air-conditioned room to a humid evening to another air-conditioned\r\nroom will have unpredictable effects. It may take the cards some time to\r\nsettle down after the ordeal.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The pre-punches also make the cards less rigid\r\nthan a normal Hollerith card,and thus more prone to bending. Bent cards\r\noften cause problems during reading. The trailing edge of the card is uneven,\r\nbecause of tabs from where the write-in tab was detached. The faces of\r\nthe card are not as smooth as a regular card, again due to the pre-punches.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">&nbsp;</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">* Ballot Reader Machines</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">So far as we know, there are no longer any\r\nmanufacturers of Hollerith card readers. High-speed card readers have a\r\nlot of precision parts. Existing readers must be periodically rebuilt,\r\nbut many companies no longer exist and the remaining manufacturers, so\r\nfar as we know, no longer offer maintenance contracts on the units. Elections\r\nis about the last market left for Hollerith card readers. Elections companies\r\nbuy up equipment from counties as they move away from Vote-O-Matic systems,\r\nand sell it jurisdictions still using Vote-O-Matic.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Elections aren't a particularly hard life for\r\na card reader, since a reader is only used for a few days a year. Still,\r\nthe readers eventually need to be rebuilt, which elections companies do\r\nwith a dwindling supply of spares,hangar queens, and whatever rebuild protocols\r\nthey devise. Still, some parts age more on calendar time than with use.\r\nAs the readers age, they become less reliable and more prone to error and\r\nbreakdown.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">&nbsp;</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">* What Happens When a Ballot Reader Reads a\r\nBallot</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Ideally, a stack of ballots is sucked one-at-a-time\r\nfrom the input hopper to the output hopper of a card reader, each being\r\ncounted accurately. However,sometimes two cards are sucked through. This\r\nis probably because pre-punching makes small ridges on the bottom of the\r\ncard, and an identical pattern of small troughs on the top. The ridges\r\ntend to get caught in the troughs. Also, feed mechanisms have to be engineered\r\nwith consideration of the air cushion between the cards, as one moves relative\r\nto the other. This air cushion will not have the same properties for Vote-O-Matic\r\ncards as for normal cards, due to surface roughness. For whatever reason,\r\nmisfeeds happen.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Hanging chad can flip open and closed. Detached\r\nchad can become stuck in the feed path, increasing double feeds and misfeeds.\r\nDetached chad can jam two cards together, increasing misfeeds. In some\r\nmachines, detached chad can jam over the light or sensor, causing holes\r\nto not be read until the chad blows out of the way. Detached chad can migrate\r\nfrom one card to the next.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Chad that was not detached before, but merely\r\nbuckled or only detached on one corner (which counts as \"not an open hole\"\r\nin many jurisdictions) can catch on other cards and become hanging chad\r\nor be torn loose.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">The read process can be quite traumatic to\r\na Vote-O-Matic card.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">&nbsp;</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Q: Is counting ballots by hand more or less\r\nreliable than counting them by machine?</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">A: A human count of Vote-O-Matic cards should\r\nalmost always produce a significantly more accurate result than automated\r\nreading. People cannot count cards as quickly as a card reader, but a card\r\nreader is much more limited than a person in how it can handle and read\r\na card. Any damage a card has sustained can confuse a card reader or cause\r\nit to malfunction. People are better able to deal with such problems.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Unfortunately, reading a Vote-O-Matic card\r\nby machine changes the card. Cards that have had one or more trips through\r\na high-speed card reader will appear different to a human reader than they\r\nwould have when freshly punched by the voter.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Erik Nilsson, an election technology analyst\r\nfor CPSR, believes that the Vote-O-Matic system should be replaced. \"For\r\na quarter century, election experts have been calling for the Vote-O-Matic\r\nsystem to be retired. The results of the 2000 election show that it is\r\nnow time move beyond this temperamental antique.\"</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">&nbsp;</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Q: Would Internet voting solve this problem?</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">A: Internet voting is often suggested as a\r\nsolution to election counting problems, but has many problems of its own,\r\nfor example:</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- If people voted from home, it would be very\r\ndifficult, perhaps</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">impossible, to assure that those who vote are\r\nwho they say they are.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Someone could vote for one of their family\r\nmembers, for example.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- If people vote from home rather than in a\r\npolling place, vote secrecy and privacy could be compromised. Elections\r\nin many democratic societies, including the U.S., are based on the promise\r\nof secret ballots, where only the voter knows who he or she voted for (unless\r\nhe or she chooses to tell others).</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- A home-based Internet-based voting system\r\nwould favor people who have computers and Internet connections at home.\r\nSuch amenities are not possessed by all citizens in the U.S.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Purely electronic ballots leave no paper\r\ntrail, so electronic subversion of voting records could be difficult or\r\nimpossible to detect.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Voting from home could destroy the sense\r\nof shared civic responsibility and pride that most people clearly feel\r\nwhen they go to an actual polling place to vote.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">On the other hand, Internet voting could offer\r\nthe following advantages:</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Customized presentation of voting choices,\r\nfor example voter-selected font size</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Reliable vote tabulation</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Access for the disabled, and rural</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">- Can handle large numbers of voters</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Computers, of course, can and will be used\r\nin elections. One approach that could provide the advantages without many\r\nof the disadvantages would be to provide Internet terminals in polling\r\nplaces. Voters would come to the polling place and identify themselves,\r\nas they always have. Vote-O-Matic and other outdated, unreliable systems\r\nwould be replaced by more current technology. Each polling place would\r\nhave a \"manual\" backup system on site, for when the network connections\r\nor computers fail (as they surely will) or when a voter is simply unable\r\nto understand how to use the computer.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">A home-based Internet voting system is completely\r\nout of the question until access to the Internet in the U.S. is universal.\r\nUntil such a time, adopting a home-based Internet voting system would be\r\nunconstitutional. Today we are far from universal access. For example,\r\nin some urban poor districts, 14% of households lack even basic phone service,\r\nmuch less Internet connections. On some Indian reservations, the percentage\r\nof phone-less households is even higher: 40%.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility\r\nwas founded in the early 1980s by computer scientists and engineers who\r\nwere concerned about the use of computer technology in military applications,\r\nparticularly the Strategic Defense, or \"Star Wars\", Initiative. In the\r\nmid-1980s, the organization branched out to include other issues, such\r\nas electronic privacy, freedom of speech, and the use of computer technology\r\nin elections.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">For further information, please visit CPSR's\r\nwebsite:</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><U><FONT COLOR=\"#0000FF\">http://www.cpsr.org/issues/voting.html</FONT></U>\r\nor contact the CPSR office</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">at 650-322-3778 or cpsr@cpsr.org to be directed\r\nto experts in the area of Internet voting.</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Susan Evoy * Managing Director</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><U><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><FONT COLOR=\"#0000FF\">http://www.cpsr.org/</FONT></FONT></U>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility</FONT>\r\n\r\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">P.O.
