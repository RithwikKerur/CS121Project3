In particular,\nall four corners of the square require bisecting at least.\nAn additional challenge is to\n\n   minimize the resulting number of triangles\n\nThe answer appears to be eight, as witnessed by my PostScript signature.\nThis fact may very well have been proven somewhere in the literature;\nlet me know if you have a reference.\n\nI attacked the problem of how to make the angles as acute as possible.\nFor an 8 triangle subdivision, this leads to an optimization problem\ninvolving two unknowns (x,y) (being one of the (symmetric) middle points\nin a square ranging from (-1,0) to (1,2)), and three necessarily equal angles.\nApplication of the cosine law results in the simultaneous equations:\n\n     x^2-x+y^2         (1-x)^2-2y+y^2      x sqrt((1-x)^2+y^2)\n   ------------- = --------------------- = -------------------\n   sqrt(x^2+y^2)   sqrt((1-x)^2+(2-y)^2)    sqrt(x^2+(2-y)^2)\n\nWith the help of expert Maple user Walter Lioen\nthis gave me the desired solution\n\n   (x,y)  ~ (.13071391155196, .379831986484951)\n\ncorresponding to an angle of about 85 degrees.\n\nNow I was wondering if a division in more triangles could achieve\neven more acute angles. I discovered that a division in 20 triangles can:\n\nFirst divide the square in two along a main diagonal. Then subdivide\neach of the two triangles into 10 smaller ones,\nby adding a small triangle in the middle (each of whose corners\nconnects to one of the outer triangle), and adding one point on each side\nof the outer triangle, connecting to two corners of the inner one.\n\nMy big question is: how do I go about optimizing the angles in such\na subdivision? It seems to involve three instead of two parameters:\nIf we position the outer triangle at (0,0),(1,0),(0,1), then the small\ninner triangle should be positioned at (w,w),(x,y),(y,x).\n\nThe problem is I'm not sure which angles should up being equal\nwhen w,x,y are chosen so as to minimize the largest angle...\n\nBy fixing some angles and optimizing a remaining single parameter I found\na solution with all angles smaller than 84 degrees, but it seems something\nclose to 80 degrees should be feasible.\n\nAny help is appreciated!\n\nregards,\n\n%!PS                      %  -John Tromp (<A HREF=\"http://www.cwi.nl/~tromp/\">http://www.cwi.nl/~tromp/</A>)\n300 200 translate 2{-1 1 26 76 0 0 200 0 200 400 0 400 26 76 200 400\n200 0 26 76 9 0 76 moveto{lineto}repeat scale}repeat stroke showpage\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> (David Eppstein)\n<B>Date:</B>           24 Oct 1996 14:17:50 -0700\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: nice geometry puzzle\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:tromp.846090364@news.cwi.nl\">tromp.846090364@news.cwi.nl</A>&gt; <A HREF=\"mailto:tromp@cwi.nl\">tromp@cwi.nl</A> (John Tromp) writes:\n&gt; I was recently reminded of an old puzzle asking for\n&gt; a subdivision of a square into acute-angled triangles\n\nThis was one of the problems in the Amer. Math. Monthly a number of\nyears ago.  Unfortunately I've lost the exact reference.\n\n&gt; ...Now I was wondering if a division in more triangles could achieve\n&gt; even more acute angles... I found a solution with all angles smaller\n&gt; than 84 degrees, but it seems something close to 80 degrees should be\n&gt; feasible.\n\nMy paper \"Provably good mesh generation\" [J. Comp. Sys. Sci. 48 (1994)\n384-409] has a triangulation of the unit square with angles at most\nroughly 80 degrees.  It uses a total of 26 triangles, five along each\nside and six in the interior.  I didn't try hard to optimize the angles\nin this triangulation and probably it could be improved a little.\n\nIf you allow subdivisions in which triangles do not always meet edge to\nedge, a method of J. L. Gerver achieves 72 degrees for any polygon\n[The dissection of a polygon into nearly equilateral triangles,\nGeom. Ded.  16 (1984) 93-106].\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:sci.math@wormwood.ICS.UCI.EDU\">sci.math@wormwood.ICS.UCI.EDU</A>, <A HREF=\"mailto:tromp@cwi.nl\">tromp@cwi.nl</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        nice geometry puzzle\n<B>Date:</B>           Thu, 24 Oct 1996 17:37:10 -0700\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nJohn Tromp asked about subdivisions of a square into acute triangles,\nto which I responded with a pointer to 26-triangle solution having all\nangles at most 80, and a method for getting solutions in which triangles\nneed not meet edge to edge, but with maximum angle 72.\n\nI now have a solution with 60 triangles, all of which do meet edge to\nedge, and in which the maximum angle is 72.  Two opposite sides of the\nsquare are partitioned into thirds, each third is covered by a 72-54-54\nisosceles triangle, and the remaining gaps on each side are filled with\nsix 36-72-72 isosceles triangles.  The space in the middle then forms\nthree hexagons, each of which can be filled with 14 triangles\n(maybe fewer triangles per hexagon would also work).\n\nI've put a picture of this triangulation on my web site at\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/acute-square/60-square.gif\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/acute-square.gif</A>.\n\nIt almost works to do a similar solution in which the two opposite sides\nof the square are subdivided in half and then covered as before with\nisosceles triangles.  The spaces between them look like they should be\nable to be filled with 12 more 36-72-72 triangles but there's just\nbarely not enough room (the resulting rectangle has dimensions 1 x 1.013).\n\nIs 72 a hard minimum?  Any better would require avoiding degree-five\nvertices inside the square, which seems to be difficult.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:sci.math@wormwood.ICS.UCI.EDU\">sci.math@wormwood.ICS.UCI.EDU</A>, <A HREF=\"mailto:John.Tromp@cwi.nl\">John.Tromp@cwi.nl</A>, <A HREF=\"mailto:mfineman@ix.netcom.com\">mfineman@ix.netcom.com</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        nice geometry puzzle\n<B>Date:</B>           Sat, 26 Oct 1996 10:44:36 -0700\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nHere's an even better solution to the problem of triangulating a square\nwith all angles at most 72.\n\nPlace as guides two congruent regular pentagons, meeting at a face,\ndiagonally in the square (as large as possible, so that four of their\ncorners touch the square's sides).  Use as triangulation vertices these\nfour points on the square's sides, the two centers of the pentagons (on\none diagonal of the square), and the two points on the other diagonal\nwhere the pentagons share a corner.\n\nThe triangulation has six 54-54-72 triangles (connecting each pentagon\ncenter to three pentagon edges), and eight 45-63-72 triangles (two at\neach corner of the square).\n\nIs fourteen triangles optimal?  One can't do better than 72 degrees\nbecause (by some manipulations with Euler's formula) any triangulated\nsquare has (1) a vertex along a square edge where only two triangles\nmeet, (2) a square corner covered by only one triangle, or (3) an\ninterior vertex where at most five triangles meet.  Cases (1) and (2)\ngive at best 90 degrees, and case (3) gives at best 72.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein\t\tUC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\t<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
