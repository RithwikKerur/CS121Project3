Although one could wait until they print the schedule of \nclasses and hand them out to students, there are severl advantages to \nunderstanding the UCI gopher system.  In the UCI gopher system there is a \nheading entitled \"Student Information\".  There you will find a <A\nHREF= \"gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/new.cat/ss/pol\"> \nschedule of classes </a> for the last couple years.  Then one can look up \nany classes they \nmany be interestd in taking.  To find a discription of political Science \nclasses you can look them up as well using Mosic, and looking into the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/pol/ugrad_program.html\n\"> Political \nScience department</a> Mosic \npage.  <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>What is HTML and how do we make a document \nin HTML format?</H2></A>\nMy answer is...HTML is an <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html#sgmlhtml\"> SGML</a> \napplication for marking up documents for inclusion in the World Wide Web.\n HTML allows you to: \nPublish documents to the Internet in a platform independent format, Create\nlinks to related works from your document, Include graphics and\nmultimedia data with your document, as well as link to non-World Wide Web \ninformation resources on the Internet.\nFor more information please refer to the ICS.1C home page under \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/refs.html\">references</a> or to\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu:80/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell/\"> Jane Powell's \nPaper</a> on defining HTML.   \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>What is the World Wide Web?</H2></A>\n\nMy answer is...A set of nodes interconnected by links.

I will be traveling abroad next year to study through \nour own Education Abroad Program (EAP).  I will be conducting intensive \nresearch that will require me to be familar with not only the country but \nalso with the <A HREF=\"http://www.blpes.ise.ac.uk.ibss\"> UK library \nsystem</a> and how to obtain research information.
