Project teams should consist of 3 or\n4 students.  Each project is expected to go through the following\nmilestones (described in more detail on the pages linked to each topic):\n\n<TABLE>\n<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>\n    <TD>7 Jan:</TD>\n    <TD>Form project teams</TD>\n    </TR>\n<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>\n    <TD>14 Jan:</TD>\n    <TD><A HREF=\"proposal.html\">Submit a proposal</A> describing the\n\tgame to be programmed,\n\tdetailing the features of game positions to be used\n\tin evaluating game positions,\n        and listing the tasks assigned to each of the team members</TD>\n    </TR>\n<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>\n    <TD>21 Jan:</TD>\n    <TD>I will review the proposals and return them to you.
