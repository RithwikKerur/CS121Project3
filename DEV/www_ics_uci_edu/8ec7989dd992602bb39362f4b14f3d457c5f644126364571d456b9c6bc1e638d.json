The scientists, burying their old professional\ncompetition in the demand of a common cause, have shared greatly and\nlearned much.  It has been exhilarating to work in effective\npartnership.  Now, for many, this appears to be approaching an end.\nWhat are the scientists to do next?\n\n<p>\n\nFor the biologists, and particularly for the medical scientists, there\ncan be little indecision, for their war work has hardly required them\nto leave the old paths.  Many indeed have been able to carry on their\nwar research in their familiar peacetime laboratories.  Their\nobjectives remain much the same.\n\n<p>\n\nIt is the physicists who have been thrown most violently off stride,\nwho have left academic pursuits for the making of strange destructive\ngadgets, who have had to devise new methods for their unanticipated\nassignments.  They have done their part on the devices that made it\npossible to turn back the enemy.  They have worked in combined effort\nwith the physicists of our allies.  They have felt within themselves\nthe stir of achievement.  They have been part of a great team.  Now,\nas peace approaches, one asks where they will find objectives worthy\nof their best.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Next:</b> <a href=\"section1.html\">Section 1</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
