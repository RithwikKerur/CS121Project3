The method chosen should depend on the properties\none desires the resulting surface to have; many interpolation methods\nare based on <A HREF=\"voronoi.html\">Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay\ntriangulations</A>.  A piecewise constant approximation, used in\nrainfall estimation, can be found by simply choosing the function value\nin each Voronoi cell to be that of the cell's generating site.  This is\na analog for continuous domains of the nearest neighbor rule from\nmachine learning theory, which has been generalized e.g. to voting among\nthree nearest neighbors; one could similarly define median-of-three\ninterpolation schemes (still piecewise constant, but less susceptable to\nerroneous data), however I know of no application in which such schemes\nhave been tried.  The Delaunay triangulation itself provides a piecewise\nlinear continuous function, defined within the convex hull of the input,\nthat minimizes a certain energy functional.  \"Natural neighbor\ninterpolation\" is defined for each point x by adding x as a site to the\nVoronoi diagram of the original sites, and averaging the sites' values\nweighted by the fraction of the cell for x previously covered by each\nother cell.  This somewhat complicated procedure results in a continuous\nfunction smooth everywhere except at the original sites.\nAt the 1995 ARO-MSI Worksh. on Comp. Geom.,\n<A HREF=\"http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/clarkson/index.html\">Ken\nClarkson</A>\ndescribed a similar technique that results in a function\nsmooth everywhere.\n<P><UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.cs.brown.edu/people/rt/sdcr/hershberger/jeh-node2.html\">Applications of computational geometry</A>.\nJohn Hershberger describes some geometric problems arising in his work\nat Mentor graphics including interpolation of thermal data, minimum spanning trees, and breakout\nrouting in PC board design.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/clarkson/hulltalk.html\">Convex hulls and interpolation</A>.
