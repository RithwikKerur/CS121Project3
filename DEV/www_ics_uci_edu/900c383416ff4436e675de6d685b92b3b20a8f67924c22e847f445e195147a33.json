The original question\nis probably very difficult:\n\n    Imagine a universe consisting of planets arrayed at the grid points\n    of an infinite plane.  On one of the planets, an angel is sitting.\n    Every day, the angel can fly off to another planet, but the angel's\n    range is limited to a distance of (say) 100.\n\n    Unfortunately, there is a devil in the universe.  Every day, the devil\n    can destroy a planet, anywhere in the universe.\n\n    Can the angel forever avoid being trapped?\n\n``Fools rush in where angels fear to tread''\n\nThere is a variation of the angel, called a fool, who, at the advice of the\nhobgoblin of small minds, only travels forward through the stars:\nthe fool only travels in directions between north-east and north-west.\n[Any resemblance to well-known people alive or dead is purely accidental.]\n\nFind a strategy for the devil to trap the fool.  Hint: for maximum jump-size\n\n                                   4*100*100\n100, the devil needs no more than 2            rounds to trap the fool.\n\n    Bill Thurston    ...!princeton!wpt\n    Mathematics Department\n    Princeton University\n    Princeton NJ 08544\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href= \n\"mailto:eppstein@garfield.columbia.edu\">eppstein@garfield.columbia.edu</a>\n<b>To:</b>             princeton!wpt\n<b>Subject:</b>        Beam detectors etc\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n...\n\nFinally, on a totally different subject, namely angels and devils.\nWinning Ways says that it has not been proven that any generalized\nchess piece can escape.

I would be\n&gt;interested in seeing how the devil can counter it.\n&gt;\n&gt;     1. Every stride of the angel is within ten degrees of due east.\n&gt;\n&gt;     2. Of all possible one-degree visual sectors within this twenty-degree\n&gt;    range, the angel selects the one with the least total \"visual darkness\"\n&gt;    and heads in that direction.\n&gt;\n&gt;     3. The angel attemps to go 100 units in the chosen direction, choosing\n&gt;    the nearest legal (and unextinguished) star.\n&gt;\n&gt;\"Visual darkness\" means the total amount of \"black light\" emitted by \n&gt;extinguished stars, as perceived by the angel according to the 1/r law\n&gt;of attenuation. To be precise, the total visual darkness in a one-degree\n&gt;sector S is defined to be \n&gt;$$Darkness(S) = \\sum_i 1/{r_i}$$\n&gt;and the sum is taken over all stars in the sector S.\n&gt;\n&gt;     That's it.\n\nThe type of angel who always goes with a certain sector is called a fool.\nThe devil (S) can catch the fool (F), as follows.  For the definiteness,\nassume that the angel can skip 100 planets in either in each step, and goes\nwithin 45 degrees of north. (any angle &lt; 90 works equally well;\nit just changes the constants.)\n\nS's strategy is to go sufficiently far away from F, choose an east-west line l,\nand defend it.  Whatever time it takes for F to get from where\nhe is halfway to l,  in that time S can eliminate every 400th planet on l\n(since the relevant part of l is twice as long as the distance from S's\nstarting postion to l).\n\nS calculates a position for l which will allow this thinning process to\ncontinue long enough to make an impenetrable barrier, of thickness 100\nplanets: S needs 400*100 iterations.  Each time F gets halfway from his\ncurrent position to l, S reassesses where F might attempt to cross l.\nBy that time the relevant portion is only half as long, so before F halves\nhis distance again S has time to thin out 1/40,000 of the planets.\n\nClearly, a starting east-west line l which is $2^40,000$ planets north of\nF is sufficient!\n\nBill Thurston   Mathematics Department, Princeton   princeton!wpt\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
