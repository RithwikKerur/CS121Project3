At Shlomo's <I>bris</I>, Raphael Meyer, his oldest brother, was given an honor\r\n(like <I>sandik</I> or <I>kvatah</I>). In the 1870's he immigrated south to Hungary. At Tiszakerecseny, \r\nhe obtained papers changing his name to Sch&ouml;nfeld. He married Chaya (<IMG SRC=\"heb/hchaya.gif\" ALIGN=absmiddle HEIGHT=16 WIDTH=31>)\r\n(1852 - 1922 [27 Sivan]), daughter of Avrohm Hersh\r\nGross, who was a chassid of R.

Shlomo \r\nbecame a very affluent cattle dealer. He owned a 350 acre farm and made an annual trip\r\nto Switzerland to purchase cows. He maintained that Swiss cows produced superior milk.\r\nHe was also an agent for the Gott estate. In 1903 (?) he moved to Hodasz, and in 1912, \r\nto Nyirbator, Hungary where he lived a healthy life until his passing. In the fall of 1931 he developed a blockage in\r\nhis intestine. Realizing that his end was near he summoned the family to his bedside. (My grandfather and great-uncle [Naftuli &amp; Shabsi Yitzchok] came from the Kaliva (Nagykallo) Yeshiva by train that Thursday night. Chava Israel was also there). He passed away that night, November 5, 1931, surrounded by his family (he had a <I>minyon</I>). He is buried in Nyirbator \r\nand several years ago his descendants, Chava Israel and Miriam Werczberger, had his grave site restored.\r\n</TD></TR></TABLE><P>\r\n\r\n<UL>\r\n<A NAME=\"L1.2.6.1\"> </A>\r\n\t<LI><FONT SIZE=+1><B>Sarah</B></FONT> <IMG SRC=\"heb/hsara.gif\" ALIGN=absmiddle HEIGHT=14 WIDTH=38>\r\n         <A href=\"frm/fsaram.htm\"><IMG SRC=\"pic/psaram.jpg\" ALIGN=absmiddle HEIGHT=19 WIDTH=30></A>\r\n         (1879 - 1952 [27 Sivan]) of TiszaKerecseny,\r\n         Hodasz, &amp; Nyirbator, Hungary, then Kosice, Slovakia, and finally New York City.
