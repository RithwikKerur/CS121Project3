Now perform a similar\nlight-shining experiment to the one described on the <A\nHREF=\"index.html\">index page</a>:\nplace a light source at an interior point of the polyhedron,\nand place a spherical screen outside the polyhedron\nhaving the light source as its centerpoint.\nThe shadows cast on the screen by the polyhedron edges will form\na spherical triangulation.  Since every edge is on two triangles\nand every triangle has three edges, 2E=3F.\n<P>\nWe now add up the angles of all the triangles; by the spherical trigonometry described above, the sum is (4+F) pi.  Adding the same angles another way, in terms of the vertices, gives a total of 2 V pi.  Since these two sums measure the same set of angles,\nF=2V-4 and combining this with the other equation 2E=3F yields the result.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<a href=\"refs.html#Som\">Sommerville</a> attributes this proof to\n<a href=\"refs.html#Leg\">Legendre</a>.\nBecause of its connections with\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/topo.html\">geometric\ntopology</a>, this is the proof used by\n<a href=\"refs.html#Weeks\">Weeks</a>,\nwho also gives an elegant proof of the spherical angle-area relationship\nbased on inclusion-exclusion of great-circular double wedges.\n<P>\nThe relation A*k = 2 pi (V-E+F)\non a surface of constant curvature k such as the sphere\nis a form of the Gauss-Bonnet formula from differential geometry.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
