For \nexample you might want to find URL's using a specific access method like \nfinding only a gopher resource.  The URL also determines the format of \nthe resource.  The file endings in combination with the protocol can give \nyou a clue what to expect with at a given URL.  The URL also locates the \nnetwork <a href= \n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.10.html\"> server </a> \nwhere you can retrieve the information.  This information is \nimportant if you are trying to find a specific network server, if you are \nlooking for a server in a particular geographic region, or if you are \ntrying to find the \"nearest\" network server in terms of network transfer \nspeed and volume. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>What are URL's</B></A>\nThe <a href= \"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url -primer.html\"> URL </a> \nis an address for the document that you are searching for.  Each URL has \ncertain <a href= \n\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/www/addressing/URL/3_Requirements.html\"> \ncharacteristics. </a>  \nThe URL tells what protocol to use to acess the resource across the \nnetwork.  The URL also tells the format of the resource along with the \nnetwork host.  A URL consists of a string of characters that uniquely \nidentifies a resource on the Internet.  There are different URL's: 1) \nFile URL's which is just an address for a file. 2) Gopher URL's which \nis an address on a Gopher server and 3) HTTP URL's which is an address \nfor hypertext documents. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>What is the purpose of HTML?</B></A>\n<a href= \nhttp://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html#A1.3.1> \nHTML </a> marks up documents for inclusion on the World Wide Web.  Markup is \nthe act of inserting additional text into a document in some way, such \nas capturing document structure or adding hypertext capability.  Markup \nalso refers to the additional text, which are inserted on the document. \n HTML tags are used to mark up the structure of a document.  HTML also \nformats information.  There are three levels of HTML and each HTML \ndocument is contained within the HTML tag. The most common way to send \nHTML documents is through the <a href= \n\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/HTTP2.html\"> HTTP </a> \nprotocol<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>How does economic policy affect every person? </B></A>\n<a href= \"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?economics\">  Economic \n</a> policy affects everyone because it affects financial markets and \nother financial institutions.  The effect that economic policy has on \nthese markets and instritutions defines how easy it is for businesses and \npeople to borrow money.

It helps us \nunderstand and predict when interest rates rise and fall and it helps us \nunderstand the evidence behind monetary policy. <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>What is the function of the Department of the Treasury?</B></A>\nThe function of the <a href= \"http://www.ustreas.gov/Welcome.html\"> \nDepartment of the Treasury </a> is to formulate and \nrecommend economic, fiscal, and tax policies; serve as financial agent of \nthe United States Government; enforce the law; protect the President \nand other officials; and manufacture coins and other currency.
