Our algorithm is randomized\nwith\nan expected running time\nO(m log n), where m is the size of the 2-skeleton of K (i.e, total\nnumber of vertices, edges and triangles),\nand n is the number of vertices. This presents a significant\nimprovement over the previous  \\Theta(mn) time\ncomplexity for arbitrary complex, matches (although in expectation\nonly) the best known result for the\nspecial case of 2-manifolds, and is faster than current algorithms\nfor\nany other special cases (e.g, 3-manifolds). Our algorithm is also very simple to implement.\nPreliminary experimental results show that\nit performs well in practice.\n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
