Why?  Because delivering versioned\n    content will be the most important product of our efforts, and our\n    plans can't rely on changing Netscape.\n\n    Of the various URL decoration proposals, only one satisfies this\n    dual requirement: having the version indicator embedded in the URL,\n    separated off by /'s.  With this, we can reuse the support already\n    in Web clients for handling relative URLs.\n\n    As Fabio discussed, and I wholeheartedly agree with, the hierarchical\n    path component of a URL is well suited to accomodating version\n    information.  This is because, I believe, an entity's version is\n    just another component of its name, albeit a component that locates\n    the entity in time rather than in (filesystem) space.\n\n    The only other possible solution, which is poor, is to have\n    version-aware servers support non version-aware clients by editing\n    the returned HTML on the fly, fixing up links with version info.\n    If anyone supports this solution, I'd like to hear it.\n\nPUT.\n\n    \"When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" My\n    personal feeling is many lives will be lost to this effort.\n    Nonetheless, I think it is inevitable that it will be done.\n\n    The significance of the PUT operation is that the Web plays the role\n    of a client/server configuration management system, with HTTP being\n    the client/server protocol.  Of course, in most cases the Web server\n    is just making use of an existing software configuration management\n    (SCM) system.\n\n    Having written a full-bore SCM system from scratch, and being familiar\n    with a dozen others, I can tell you that supporting the union of\n    all SCM practices and architectures will be, uh, difficult.  The\n    major differences is not whether they require locked head revisions\n    but rather how well their architecture fits in with the Web's\n    client/server model.\n\n    To wit:\n\n    1)  SCM systems such as CVS rely on state information, stored\n        on the client, to know what version of what documents are\n        being edited (and thus what will be \"put\" back).  CVS's\n        state information is fairly trivial, and could be embedded\n        into the HTML documents being edited.  But that doesn't work\n        so well if the entities aren't HTML.  When the user PUTs a\n        GIF, how will a version-aware Web server based on CVS recover\n        the state necessary to check the GIF in?\n\n        SCM systems that store the state in the server, such as\n        ClearCase, don't have this same problem, I think.  But make\n        no mistake about it: these version-aware Web servers are\n        quite stateful.\n\n    2)  Other SCM systems have fairly heavyweight client\n        implementations themselves, with a fat protocol between the\n        client and server.  For example, it is unlikely that a\n        version-aware Web client would be able to carry out all the\n        machinations necessary to be a ClearCase view (i.e. a client).\n\n        The only solution I see to this is to have the Web server\n        maintain private client workspaces on behalf its own clients,\n        and act as a proxy to those clients.  Playing out the\n        ClearCase example, the Web server would have a view for each\n        of the Web clients who will PUT documents.\n\n    3)  The picture is even less rosy with SCM systems that require\n        the client to have direct file access to the repository.  A\n        large chunk of the commercial SCM systems -- PVCS, MKS Source\n        Integrity, Continuus, Microsoft's SourceSafe -- are in this\n        boat.  I can't see any way they can be backend to a version-aware\n        Web server without the Web server having to act as proxy to\n        client workspaces maintained on the server.\n\n        Maybe David Fiander can say what MKS does to support this.\n        There must be a decent solution in there somewhere.\n\n    4)  Aside from architecture, the model varies wildly from one SCM\n        system to the next.  And as has been discussed, the lock-the-head\n        vs merge-into-trunk vs change-set models all need to be\n        accomodated.\n\n        Going further, something that we (P3) support is atomic checkin\n        of multiple documents, because it allows you to move the repository\n        forward in whole chunks rather than a file-at-a-time.  Certainly\n        we think this is important for Web documents as well, and would\n        like to see multiple PUTs with a single COMMIT possible.\n\nVersion control.\n\n    All the wrinkles that make a simple PUT difficult are going to make\n    flowing full version control models over HTTP truly daunting.\n    It might be possible to come up with a limited set of operations that\n    make sense across all models, but the examples put forth so far --\n    compute the predecessor revision and show a version tree -- each only\n    make sense in a subset of the systems.\n\nMy flame-retardant personal opinion is that supporting GETs is well\nwithin the ability of this group, that PUTs will get mired for long\nenough that some defacto industry implementation will set the lead and\nthus simplify the range of models that need supporting, and that the\nrest of version control via HTTP will follow after that.  But I welcome\ncontrary opinions, because in this case I'd be glad to be wrong.\n\nChristopher\n----\nChristopher Seiwald     P3 Software             <a href=\"http://www.p3.com\">http://www.p3.com</a>\n<a href=\"mailto:seiwald@p3.com\">seiwald@p3.com</a>          f-f-f-fast SCM          1-510-865-8720\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0063.html\">Larry Masinter: \"version management and relative links\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0061.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: More versioning thoughts.\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next in thread:</b> <a href=\"0066.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: what's doable in Web version control\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe reply:</b> <a href=\"0066.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: what's doable in Web version control\"</a>\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
