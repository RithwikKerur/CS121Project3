Kay</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=5>Activity 2: Design a Course of Your Choice</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>For most of the rest of the quarter,\neach of you will design a course\nof your choosing.  We will approach this in stages.</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>For the next class, first choose the topic of your course.\n  You may stick with the intro course you've already started or you may choose any\n  other topic that might reasonably be offered\n  in your field.  You should not feel\n  bound by any course that currently exists, in ICS or elsewhere.  On the other\n  hand, if you wish to borrow from an existing\n  course, that's fine; just cite which course and\n  whose materials you're using.  There's a long\n  tradition in teaching of borrowing materials\n  from other instructors; not everything you use\n  has to be perfectly original.  But for purposes\n  of our seminar, you're not going to learn much\n  if you just copy someone else's materials\n  wholesale.</font></p>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>Prepare four slides as follows (though it may take more if you use PowerPoint):</font></p>\n<ol>\n  <li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">Background:  What institution is your\ncourse offered at (UCI, MIT, ...)?  What are\nthe students like?  Is it on quarters or\nsemesters?  What's the topic of your course?\nWhat audience level are you aiming at\n(first-year students, seniors, ...)?  Is the\ncourse required?  What are the prerequisites?\nWhat do you expect the class size to be?\nWill you have TAs or graders?  Will there\nbe scheduled discussion or lab sessions?\nYou have free rein to make up the answers\nto these questions, but once you decide, you\nneed to design your course to meet those\nconstraints.</font></li>\n  <font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\"><br />\n  </font>\n  <li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">Student learning outcomes:  As before, what are the 5-10 goals or outcomes\nof your course (things\nyou want students to be able to <em>do</em> by the end\nof the course)?  (Think about how you might\nmeasure how students have attained these\ngoals, but don't write anything about that yet.)\nAlso answer these questions:  What are the\nthree most valuable or most important concepts\nin the course for students?  What do you think\nwill bethe three most <em>difficult</em> concepts or skills\nin the course (for you to teach, for the students to learn)?</font></li>\n  <font face=\"AGaramond\"><font size=\"4\"><br />\n  </font></font>\n  <li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">Outline/schedule:  For each class meeting,\nwrite 3-5 words about the topic or activity for\nthat meeting.  In a typical quarter-long class\nwith 10 weeks and 2 meetings per week, that\nwould be 20 lines.  Be sure to leave time for\nholidays (usually one or two per quarter) and\nfor exams (if you're having any). </font></li> <br />\n  <li><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">Active learning: Everything we currently know about learning tells us that straight lecturing is not a very effective way to get students to learn. Pick one class meeting from your outline above and describe how you will address those topics using some kind of active learning techniques.</font></li>\n</ol>\n<p><font face=\"AGaramond\" size=4>Please <!-- e-mail me a copy of your work by the night before class (any reasonably standard form is fine). Then--> bring an electronic version to class to present (anything that will work with the classroom projection system is fine). Keep your own copy of these slides; you'll be adding to them as the quarter goes on and sending/presenting the whole revised package each time, so we can refer back to the previous material.</font></p>\n<p><font size=\"4\" face=\"AGaramond\">As always, feel free to send questions or comments by e-mail (or stop by in person, of course).</font></p>\n<hr />\n<p> <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/\"><font face=\"AGaramond\">David G.
