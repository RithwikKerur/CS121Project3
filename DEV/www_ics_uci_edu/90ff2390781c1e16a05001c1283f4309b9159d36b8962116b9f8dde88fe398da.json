KAY &bull; UC IRVINE &bull; FALL 2011</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\" SIZE=6><B>Third Homework </B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">This assignment is due at the start of lab on\nMonday, October 10. The concepts here (of working with structures and lists) are fundamental to the rest of the course. Be sure to check with us if you'd like clarification or help.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(1)</B> Read Chapters 16 (which gives some advice for designing functions), 17 (which uses <span class=\"bodycode\">cond</span> in animations), and 18 (which covers key handlers and mouse handlers). Since you probably haven't gotten to them yet from Lab Assignment 2, look over exercises 17.1.3, 17.1.6, 17.2.6, 18.1.2, 18.1.3, 18.2.4, and 18.2.5; you'll do them as part of Lab Assignment 3, but scan them now to get an idea of what's coming.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(2)</B> Chapter 19 briefly covers error handling, the <span class=\"bodycode\">error</span> function (that you can put in your code to stop it and produce an error message), and the <span class=\"bodycode\">check-error</span> function (so you can have tests of situations that are supposed to cause errors).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(3)</B> Chapter 20 introduces structures.  Read it and do exercises 20.4.6 and 20.5.7. Look at exercise 20.6.2, which suggests &quot;refactoring&quot; some code (reorganizing it to reduce duplication). You don't have to show the TA a solution to 20.6.2, but you do have to have written solutions (or questions) about the other exercises listed here. Do exercise 20.7.3.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><b>(4) </b>Chapter 21 continues with structures. Read it and do exercises 21.1.1, 21.4.4, 21.5.3.</FONT></P>\n<p> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><b>(5) </b>Chapter 22 introduces lists.  Read it and do exercises 22.5.3 and 22.5.4 (which are very similar to examples we did in class).</FONT></p>\n<p> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><b>(6) </b>Suppose you have restaurant structures as defined in class: <span class=\"bodycode\">(define-struct rrant (name cuisine phone dish price))</span>. Write a function called <span class=\"bodycode\">cheap-Thai</span> that takes a list of restaurants as its input and returns a list of all the cheap Thai restaurants on the input list (where cheap means the price is under $10). This too is similar to what we did in class; look up the transcript from that day and write the necessary extra &quot;helper&quot; or &quot;auxiliary&quot; functions (like <span class=\"bodycode\">cheap?</span>) to separate out each part of the task.</FONT></p><p> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(7) </B>Look at the  sections K, L, M, N, and O of the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/scheme/finger.html\">Scheme Finger Exercises</a>. You don't have to write the answers down or turn them in, but make sure you know how to do them. If you aren't perfectly, 100% comfortable with structures and lists, you need to check these out.</FONT><BR />\n</p>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Based in part on ICS H21assignments by David\n    G.
