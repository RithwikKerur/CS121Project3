This has been exploited \nto reduce the energy consumption by slowing down the processor. The \nalgorithms that are explained in this talk are based on the following \nmodel that captures this key aspect of energy minimization. Each job is \nto be executed between its arrival time and deadline by a single \nprocessor with variable speed. The processor running at speed <I>s</I> consumes \nenergy per unit time P(s) = <I>s</I><sup><I> p</I></sup>, <I>p</I> &ge; 2. We are asked to schedule the \njobs so that the total energy is minimized. The offline version can be \nsolved optimally in polynomial time [1]. I will provide the algorithm \nand proof. [1] also provides an online algorithm with a competitive \nratio between <I>p<sup> p</sup></I> and 2<sup><I>p</I>-1</sup> <I>p<sup> p</sup></I>. In a recent improvement, Bansal et \nal. in [2] have provided an online algorithm that has a competitive \nratio of <I>p<sup> p</sup></I>. I will explain this algorithm and provide proof if time \npermits.\n<P>\nReferences:\n<BR>\n1.
