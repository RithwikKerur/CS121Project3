Draw the residual graph for this\nflow.\n\n(b) What is the shortest augmenting path in the residual graph?\n\n(c) What is the maximum-capacity augmenting path in the residual graph?\n\n(d) Find and show a maximum flow from s to t and a minimum cut\nseparating s to t. The total amount of flow (that is, the amount of flow\non the edges going out of s, or on the edges going in to t) and the\ntotal amount of the cut (the total capacity of the edges from the s side\nof the cut to the t side of the cut) should be equal -- what are these\nvalues?\n\n\n(2) Suppose that it is near the end of the baseball season. Each of the\nfour teams in the American League West (the Angels, the Athletics, the\nMariners, and the Rangers) has three more games to play, one against\neach other team. The Angels can win the division if they win all three\nof their games and each other team wins at most one other game.\n\n(a) Draw a maximum flow problem in which the maximum flows correspond to\nscenarios in which the Angels can win the division. Your flow problem\nshould have a source vertex, a vertex for each of the non-Angel games,\nand a vertex for each other team; the flow amount from a game vertex to\na team vertex should be 1 in a scenario where that team wins that game,\nand 0 otherwise.\n\n(b) Can the Angels still win, or have they already been eliminated?\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
