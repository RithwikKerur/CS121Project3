You can do this assignment on any\noperating system that supports the Unix API (Linux andromeda-XX.ics.uci.edu machines, your laptop\nthat runs Linux or Linux VM, and even MacOS, etc.). Submit your 238P shell through Canvas <a\n href=\"https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/8600\">Canvas HW1 Shell</a>\nsee instructions at the bottom of this page. \n\n<p>First, you have to read the Chapter 0 of the <a href=\"https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/xv6/book-rev9.pdf\">xv6 book</a>.\n\n<p>If you are not familiar with what a shell does, do the <a\nhref=\"http://web.mit.edu/6.033/2015/wwwdocs/assignments/handson-unix.html\">Unix\nhands-on</a> from 6.033 class at MIT (this is optional and will not be graded in 238P). \n\n<p>Download the <a href=\"sh.c\">238P shell</a>, and look it\nover. The 238P shell contains two main parts: parsing shell commands and\nimplementing them. The parser recognizes only simple shell commands such as the\nfollowing:\n\n<pre>\nls > y\ncat < y | sort | uniq | wc > y1\ncat y1\nrm y1\nls |  sort | uniq | wc\nrm y\n</pre>\nCut and paste these commands into a file <tt>t.sh</tt>\n\n<p>To compile <tt>sh.c</tt>, you need a C compiler, such as gcc.  On andromeda-XX.ics.uci.edu (Openlab machines), you\ncan compile the skeleton shell as follows:\n<pre>\n$ gcc sh.c\n</pre>\nwhich produces an <tt>a.out</tt> file, which you can run:\n<pre>\n$ ./a.out < t.sh\n</pre>\nThis execution will print error messages because you have not implemented several features. In\nthe rest of this assignment you will implement those features.\n\n<p>Alternatively you can pass an additional option to gcc to give a more meaningful name to the compiled binary, like\n<pre>\n$gcc sh.c -o sh238P\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here gcc will compile your shell as <tt>sh238P</tt>. \n\n<h2>Executing simple commands</h2>\n\n<p>Now, you're ready to work on the homework itself. First, extend your shell to implement simple commands, such as executing external programs, for example ls:\n<pre>\n$ ls\n</pre>\n\n<p>Here you tell the shell to execute ls.\n\n<p>In the sh.c, the parser already builds an <tt>execcmd</tt> for you, so the only code you\nhave to write is for the ' ' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>. <b>At a high level you should understand a \ntypical UNIX interface that we've discussed in class (the functions to cone processes, i.e., \nfork(), executing new processes, i.e., exec(), working with file descriptors (close(), dup(), open(), wait(), etc.). \nCombine these functions to implement various shell features.</b>  \n\n\n\n<p>\nYou might find it useful\nto look at the manual page for exec, for example, type\n<pre>\n$man 3 exec\n</pre>\nand read about <tt>execv</tt>. Print an error message when exec fails.\n\n<p>To test your program, compile and run the resulting a.out:\n<pre>\n$./a.out\n</pre>\n\nThis prints a prompt and waits for input. <tt>sh.c</tt> prints as prompt\n<tt>238P$</tt> so that you don't get confused with your computer's shell.\n\nNow type the following in your shell:\n<pre>\n238P$ ls\n</pre>\n\n<p>Your shell may print an error message (unless there is a program named\n<tt>ls</tt> in your working directory or you are using a version\nof <tt>exec</tt> that searches <tt>PATH</tt>, i.e., execlp(), execvp(), or execvpe()).  \n\nNow type the following:\n\n<pre>\n238P$ /bin/ls\n</pre>\n\n<p>This should execute the program <tt>/bin/ls</tt>, which should print out the\nfile names in your working directory. You can stop the 238P shell by typing\nctrl-d, which should put you back in your computer's shell.\n\n<p>You may want to change the 238P shell to always try <tt>/bin</tt>, if the program\ndoesn't exist in the current working directory, so that below you don't have to\ntype \"/bin\" for each program, or (which is better) use one of the exec functions \nthat search the <tt>PATH</tt> variable. \n\n<h2>I/O redirection</h2>\n\n<p>Implement I/O redirection commands so that you can run:\n<pre>echo \"238P is cool\" > x.txt\ncat < x.txt\n</pre>\n\n<p>The parser already recognizes \">\" and \"<\", and builds a <tt>redircmd</tt> for\nyou, so your job is just filling out the missing code in <tt>runcmd</tt> for\nthose symbols. You might find the man pages for open and close useful.\n\n<p>Note that the <tt>mode</tt> field in <tt>redircmd</tt> contains access modes\n  (e.g., <tt>O_RDONLY</tt>), which you should pass in the <tt>flags</tt>\n  argument to <tt>open</tt>; see <tt>parseredirs</tt> for the mode values that\n  the shell is using and the manual page for <tt>open</tt> for\n  the <tt>flags</tt> argument.\n\n<p>Make sure you print an error message if one of the system calls you are using fails.\n\n<p>Make sure your implementation runs correctly with the above test input.  A\ncommon error is to forget to specify the permission with which the file must be\ncreated (i.e., the 3rd argument to open).\n\n<h2>Implement pipes</h2>\n\n<p>Implement pipes so that you can run command pipelines such as:\n<pre>\n$ ls | sort | uniq | wc\n</pre>\n\n<p>The parser already recognizes \"|\", and builds a <tt>pipecmd</tt> for you, so\nthe only code you must write is for the '|' case in <tt>runcmd</tt>.  You might\nfind the man pages for pipe, fork, close, and dup useful.\n\n<p>Test that you can run the above pipeline. The <tt>sort</tt> program may be in\nthe directory <tt>/usr/bin/</tt> and in that case you can type the absolute\npathname <tt>/usr/bin/sort</tt> to run sort.  (In your computer's shell you can\ntype <tt>which sort</tt> to find out which directory in the shell's search path\nhas an executable named \"sort\".)\n\n<p>From one of the andromeda machines you should be able to run the following \ncommand correctly (here a.out is your 238P shell):\n<pre>\n$ a.out < t.sh\n</pre>\n\n\n<p>Don't forget to submit your solution through \nCanvas <a href=\"https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/8600\">Canvas HW1 Shell</a>\n(as a source file \"sh.c\"). If you decide to submit a challenge exercise submit two files \n(\"sh.c\" and \"sh-extra.c\", and a shell script \"extra.sh\" that contains an example \nextra command that your shell can handle as a single tar or zip archive). \nPlease write us a comment at the top of \n\"sh-extra.c\" explaining  which extra features you decided to handle. \n\n<h2>Challenge exercises (extra 21%, 7% each)</h2>\n\n<p>You can add <b>any</b> feature of your choice to your shell.  But, you may want to consider\nthe following as a start:\n<ul>\n<li> Implement lists of commands, separated by \";\"\n<li> Implement sub shells by implementing \"(\" and \")\"\n<li> Implement running commands in the background by supporting \"&\" and \"wait\"\n</ul>\nAll of these require making changes to the parser and the <tt>runcmd</tt>\nfunction.\n\n\n\t</TD>\t\t\t\n\t</TR>\n\t<TR>\n\t\t<TD ALIGN=\"LEFT\" BGCOLOR=\"#FFFFFF\"><!-- top margin --> \n\t\t\t<IMG SRC=\"./images/spacer.gif\" WIDTH=\"100%\" HEIGHT=\"15\" ALT=\"\" BORDER=\"0\"/>\n\t\t</TD>\n\t</TR>\n\t<TR>\n\t<TD COLSPAN=\"4\">\n\t\t<DIV ID=\"tech\">Updated: January, 2018</DIV>\n\t</TD>\n\t</TR>\n\t</TABLE>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
