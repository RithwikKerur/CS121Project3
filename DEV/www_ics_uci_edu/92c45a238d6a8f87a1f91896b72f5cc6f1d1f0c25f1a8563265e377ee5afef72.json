It has higher \nresolution than some of the other microscopes (i.e. <a \nhref=\"http://www-i.almaden.ibm.com/vis/stm.html\">scanning tunnelling \nmicroscopes</a>, scanning force microscopes, and scanning near-field optical \nmicroscopes), and yet do less radiation damage to the specimen.  One \nbiological use of the X-ray microscope would be in the study of \nchromosomes, where they can be examined in a wet environment, as opposed \nto being dried in preparation for viewing through the other microscopic \ntechniques.\n<p>If you happen to be a Beckman Institute or University of Illinois \nresearcher, faculty, or visitor, you may be able to have access to such \nmicroscopes at the <a \nhref=\"http://delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu/access.html\">VizLab.</a>\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What are these \"virtual malls\" that I'm \nseeing all over the web?</H2></A> \nWhile poking around on the WWW, I have found \nnumerous \"malls\" that are arranged quite similarly to the physical \nshopping malls.  <a href=\"http://virtuamall.com\">Virtumall</a> is such an \nexample, where it harbors such establishments as <b>The Maples Fruit \nFarm</b>--caters fruit baskets,<b> Five Star Cookie Company, Going \nGreek</b>--a store that sells clothing for campus clubs and organizations, \nand <b>East Coast Brewing Supply.</b>  This mall is even arranged in two  \nlevels to make room for new shops that want to open up.\n<p>Another large virtual multi-mall called<a \nhref=\"http://www.cybermalls.com\">  \nCyberMalls</a> contains mini malls that are grouped by the type of products \nthat they offer.  <a \nhref=\"http://www.cybermalls.com/cywharf/cywhamal.html\">CyberWharf</a> \ncarries everything from power boats to fishing products to nautical clothing!\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>Okay, I have found a shop that accepts \"ecash.\" \nWhat's that??</H2></A> \nSometimes when doing business over the \ninternet, conventional cash can become difficult to use.  <a \nhref=\"http://www.digicash.com/ecash\">Ecash</a> is <b>electronic cash</b> \nthat has all the benefits of regular cash, and yet it is safe, fast, and \nallows the buyer to remain anonymous still!  Even though it is still in a \ntesting phase, it does seem highly foreseeable in the future that it will \nbecome common use.  An experimental grocery store, <a href= \n\"http://rainer.bnt.com/htbin/wa\">Wane's Online Grocery Store,</a> allows \npeople to grab a shopping cart and select items off of aisles while a \nrunning total is kept on the screen.\n<p>\nNot only can ecash be used to make purchases, it can also be used for \ndonations.  <a href=\"http://www.dds.nl/~tsoc/tsoc.html\">The \nSamaritans</a> is one such place.  They are a non-religious charity group \nthat offers support for suicidal and dispairing people in the United \nKingdom.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>I want to find out EVERYTHING I can about the \none and only Sin City...Las Vegas.  What's the quickest way?</H2></A> \nWell, you can find out practically everything you want to know about the  \nGlittering City by accessing <a href=\"http://www.infi.net/vegas/online\">Las\nVegas Online.</a>  Here, you can gather information about <a \nhref=\"http://www.infi.net/vegas/KLAS-TV\">the local news, weather, and  \nsports</a>, or if you would like to compare <a \nhref=\"http://www.infi.net/vegas/lvr/hotels.html\">current room rates</a> \nand locate <a href=\"http://www.infi.net/vegas/vlv/eatout.html\">major Las \nVegas restaurants.</a>  Of course, no Las Vegas homepage is complete \nwithout a <a href=\"http://www.infi.net/vegas/vlv/games.html\">gaming \nguide!</a>  Did you know that there are 114,668 slot machines and 3,722 \nlive table games in the county?  Or that Clark County casinos raked in $5.09 \nbillion in 1994?!?\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>How are businesses utilizing the internet \nnowadays to gain that extra advantage?</H2></A> \nI never knew that <a href=\"http://www.deltanet.com/nissan1\">Universal \nCity Nissan</a> (near Universal Studios Tour) has a homepage that \nintroduces the dealership on a more friendly level.  If you're \ninterested, you can read a biographya <a \nhref=\"http://www.deltanet.com/nissan1/morrie.html\">Morrie Sage,</a> the \nowner of the dealership.  Now how often can you do that if you just \nwent to a dealership?  You can also do everything you're able to do at a \nNissan dealership such as getting the specs on all the latest \nmodels, but short of actually test driving it.\n<p>If you happen to be a <a \nhref=\"http://www.deltanet.com/nissan1/nissan/nrace.html\">car racing \nfan,</a> Universal City Nissan also has a small section that gives you \nNissan's world racing schedule and a little photo gallery of shots of \ntheir hot performance cars.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n</UL>\n\n<hr>\n<address>John Kao<br>\n<p>\neabu246@ea.oac.uci.edu</address>\n<p>\n\nSubmitted March 23, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
