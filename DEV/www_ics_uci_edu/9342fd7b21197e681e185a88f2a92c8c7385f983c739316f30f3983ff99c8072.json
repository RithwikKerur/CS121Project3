This result is theoretically quite practical\nbecause it beats the best known exact algorithm's time of\nO(n<sup>3</sup>) while not yielding a terribly bad triangulation.\nTheir result can be applied to speed up many heuristics for\ntriangulation of general point sets.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
