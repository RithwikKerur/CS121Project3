Does\nthis argument appears in the literature?  The argument goes as\nfollows:\n\nConsider the set of complex lines in C^2; it is parametrized by the\ncomplex numbers and infinity.  The set of linear transformations on C^2\nis a group action on this set; let the corresponding permutation group\nof the set be G.  Since [[a,b],[c,d]] sends (1,z) to (a+bz,c+dz), it\nthus sends the slope z to (c+dz)/(a+bz).  If a linear transformation\npreserves the lines (z,0) and (0,z), it must be diagonal, and if it\npreserves a third line also, it must be proportional to the identity.\nAs any pair of lines in C^2 is equivalent to any other, we conclude\nthat if an element of G fixed three points, it is the identity.\n\nExtend G to G-hat by adding complex conjugation.  In G-hat, there are\ntwo elements which fix any given triple of points.  Indeed, we can say\nwhat the other one is:  Inversion in the (generalized) circle through\nthe three points.  To know this, we only need to know that all\ninversions in circles are in G-hat.  Inversion in the unit circle is\nsimply z -&gt; 1/z-bar, and by conjugating by elements of G we can make\ninversion in any other circle.\n\nSo we now have a characterization of generalized circles:  They are the\ncollection of fixed sets of elements of G-hat with at least three\npoints.  Any element of G-hat must permute this collection.  In\nparticular, z -&gt; 1/z-bar does.\n-- \n   /\\   Greg Kuperberg        <A HREF=\"mailto:greg@math.ucdavis.edu\">greg@math.ucdavis.edu</A>\n  /  \\ \n  \\  /  Recruiting or seeking a job in math?
