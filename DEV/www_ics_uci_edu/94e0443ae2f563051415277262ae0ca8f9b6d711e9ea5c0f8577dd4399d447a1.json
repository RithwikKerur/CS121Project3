(Not graded, because I gave the wrong definition of the layering algorithm in class and didn't correct the mistake until after the homeworks were turned in.)\n\nThe correct layering algorithm processes the vertices in the reverse of a topological ordering, placing each one as low as possible. So d goes on the bottom layer. b and c both go on the next-to-bottom layer, because they have to go higher than b. Then (for the topological ordering from question 5) a is placed next, and is free to go on the bottom layer, so it does. Finally, f and then e are placed, and they have to go above b and c for two reasons: they have edges to b and c, and the layer containing b and c is full. So we get the drawing that I already gave as the answer to question 3.\n\n\n7. a, e, and f could all be first, because they have no incoming edges. a or d could be last, because they have no outgoing edges.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
