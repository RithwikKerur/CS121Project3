We refer to a data structure that can e ciently\nreact to such updates as reactive. We present novel reactive proximity\ndata structures for graphs of polynomial expansion, i.e., the class of\ngraphs with small separators, such as planar graphs and road\nnetworks. Our data structures can be used directly in several logistical\nproblems and geographic information systems dealing with real-time data,\nsuch as emergency dispatching. We experimentally compare our data\nstructure to Dijkstra's algorithm in a system emulating random queries\nin a real road network.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on joint work with David Eppstein and Michael T.
