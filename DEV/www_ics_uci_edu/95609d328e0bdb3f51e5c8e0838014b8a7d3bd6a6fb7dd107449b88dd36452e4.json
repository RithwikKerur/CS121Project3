As far as I know, only\nthe map for molecular biology has been published so far.  As I recall,\nhere is the procedure.  The citations in the literature are analyzed for\na certain period; those items cited most (from before the period) are\nsingled out as \"citation classics\".  Then the \"distance\" between research\npapers of the period is determined by the number of citation\nclassics they cite in common.  They find that research papers tend to\nfall into groups of closely related papers, which they call \"specialties\".\nBut also they get a distance between specialties.  Then they were able to\narrange the specialties in a plane so that the distances were approximated.\nThe result is a \"Map\" of the field of molecular biology.\n\nHere is the bibliographic information:\n\nISI atlas of science: biochemistry and molecular biology: including\nminireviews of 102 research front specialties.  1978/80-  Philadelphia, PA. :\nInstitute for Scientific Information,  1981-  v. :  ill. ;  29 cm.\n\n--\n  Gerald A.
