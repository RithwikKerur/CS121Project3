I \r\nlive in Melbourne Australia and my cousins are the \r\nLangsam family live in Sydney. I will be in contact with\r\nthem to see if they can communicate with you.\r\n\r\nI will fill you in as much as I know, since my \r\nrelationship is from the female side of the family. \r\nClara Langsam (nee Rosenbaum) marrried to Walter Langsam\r\n(died just over a year ago) -  children are \r\nJackie (married to Wayne Black with two children \r\n\tKara and Jesse), \r\nPaul (married last year) and\r\nMichelle (unmarried). \r\nWalter has a brother currently living in Sydney. Both\r\ncame to Australia after the holocaust from Germany.\r\n\r\nRegards...
