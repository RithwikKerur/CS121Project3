This is the book I recommend.\n   <li> <em> Java: An Introduction to Computer Science and Programming </em>\nby Walter Savitch.\n<br> Straightforward and complete introduction to language that can be used by\npeople with no programming experience.\nStudents like this text.\n   <li> <em> Introduction to Programming Using Java: An Object-Oriented \napproach  </em> by David Arnold  and David Weiss. \n<br>Introduction to \nobject-oriented programming using Java. Meant as a first CS course text.\nI liked it.\n  <li> <em> Up to Speed with Swing</em> by  Steven Gutz. Assumes you know Java\nand introduces basic Swing classes. Readable.\n   <li> <em> Computing Concepts using Java Essentials </em> by Cay Horstmann.\n   <br> Covers Java for the beginning programming student.
