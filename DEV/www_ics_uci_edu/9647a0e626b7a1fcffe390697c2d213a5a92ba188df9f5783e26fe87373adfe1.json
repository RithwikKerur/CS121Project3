This is your opportunity to pick\none language and create such an overview, on a web page that will be <A HREF=\"http://e3.uci.edu/~36258f99/PL/\">part of the ICS 141 materials on line</A>.</FONT></P>\n<BR><BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>How does this affect my course grade?</B>\n This project is entirely optional.  It doesn&#39;t have a direct effect\non your course grade:  There aren&#39;t any course points associated with\nit; it won&#39;t make up for weak performance on the homeworks or exams.\n On the other hand, if you do reasonably well in the course, doing a good\njob on this project might give your course grade a small boost.  In addition,\na good job on this project lets me say something unique and positive about\nyou if you ask me to be a job reference or to write a letter of recommendation;\nthis means much more than a simple recitation of how good a grade you got\nin my class.  Finally, the main reason to do it is that it&#39;s fun to\nlearn about something new and unusual, and it&#39;s a gentle, manageable\nintroduction to doing some independent research.</FONT></P>\n<BR><BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>What language should I choose?</B>  You\nmay choose any language from the list below:</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Alphard, Algol 60, Algol 68, APL, AppleScript,\nAPT, Autocoder, Awk, B, BCPL, BLISS, CLOS, CLU, Dylan, Forth, Frontier,\nHaskell, Icon, ISETL, Jovial, Leda, Logo, Mathematica, Miranda, ML (SML,\nStandard ML), Modula (Modula 2, Modula 3), nroff/troff, Oberon, Object Pascal,\nPL/360, PL/I, PL/C, Prograph, PPL, Python, REXX, RPG (RPG-II), Simula, Smalltalk,\nSnobol, Stagecast Creator, T, Tcl (and Tk), TeX, Turing, Visual Basic (VBA),\nWATFOR (WATFIV)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>If you&#39;d like to choose a language that\nisn&#39;t on the list, check with me first.  Any language for this project\nmust be a Turing-equivalent programming language, and it can&#39;t be a\nlanguage that was done last quarter or one of these popular languages: \nAda, Basic, C, C++, Cobol, Fortran, Java, Pascal, Prolog, or Scheme.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Only one person in the class may choose a\ngiven language.  To reserve a language, send Email with your request to\n</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">kay</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\n(on EA or at ICS); if someone has already chosen your language, I&#39;ll\nlet you know and you can pick again.  Once you reserve a language, you may\nnot change your choice, so it&#39;s a good idea to do a bit of preliminary\nresearch to make sure the language you ask for is the one you want to stay\nwith.</FONT></P>\n<BR><BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Where can I find information?</B>  A good\nplace to start is the textbook and the references in its bibliography. \nMost of the publications listed should be available in the Science Library.\n These Web-based resources should also be helpful, but note that some of\nthese aren&#39;t academically authoritative:</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The Language List, </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://cuiwww.unige.ch/cgi-bin/langlist\">http://cuiwww.unige.ch/cgi-bin/langlist</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\n</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Programming Language Resources, </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/language/language.htm\">http://burks.brighton.ac.uk/burks/language/language.htm</A></FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The Hello World Page, </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.latech.edu/~acm/HelloWorld.shtml\">http://www.latech.edu/~acm/HelloWorld.shtml</A></FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall, </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ionet.net/~timtroyr/funhouse/beer.html\">http://www.ionet.net/~timtroyr/funhouse/beer.html</A></FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Amazon.com should point you to books on many\nof the languages; the titles may be useful on your page even if you don&#39;t\nread a whole book on your language.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A general web search, e.g., on </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">google.com</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<BR><BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>What should I put on my page?</B>  Include\nanswers to as many of the following questions as possible.
