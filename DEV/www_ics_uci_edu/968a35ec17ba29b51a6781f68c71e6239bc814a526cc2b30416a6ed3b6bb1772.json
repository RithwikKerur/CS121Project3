You may assign index numbers to\nthe vertices arbitrarily; state separately what index you used for each vertex.\n\n\n(2) Describe the same graph as in question 1, using the dictionary-based\nrepresentation of Guido van Rossum from http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs/\nYou may use either the web page names or the index numbers you used\nin question 1 to represent each vertex.\n\n\n(3) For any fixed graph, there may be many different orders in which\ndepth-first-search could visit the vertices, depending on which vertex\nthe search starts from and what order the neighbors of each vertex are\nlisted in. For the graph from question 1, describe an ordering that\ncould not possibly be generated in this way by DFS.\n\n\n(4) Let G be a larger graph, formed by adding the following edges and\nvertices to the graph in question 1:\n- A vertex x.html and an edge from x.html to a.html\n- A vertex y.html and an edge from b.html to y.html\n- A vertex z.html and an edge from c.html to z.html\n- Edges in both directions between y.html and z.html\nWhat are the strongly connected components of G?\n\n\n(5) Transposing a matrix means flipping it along a diagonal from upper\nleft to lower right; for instance, the transpose of the matrix\n[ 0 1 1 0 ]\n[ 1 0 1 0 ]\n[ 1 0 0 0 ]\n[ 0 0 1 0 ]\n\nis the matrix\n[ 0 1 1 0 ]\n[ 1 0 0 0 ]\n[ 1 1 0 1 ]\n[ 0 0 0 0 ].\n\nIf two graphs G and H have adjacency matrices that are the transposes\nof each other, then what does that mean in terms of how the edges and\nvertices of G and H are related to each other?", "encoding": "ascii"}
