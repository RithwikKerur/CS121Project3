This course will explore a range of information\nresources and communication tools available over the Internet, with\nemphases on the organization of computer networks and the information\nthey provide.\n<p>\nNetworked Information Discovery and Retrieval (NIDR) is the generally\naccepted term in the networking community for the variety of resources,\ntechniques, and underlying concepts surrounding remotely accessible\ninformation. \n``How-to'' details about using the various tools for NIDR are\nnot a principal part of this course, although students will learn\nthem ``along the way'' through their laboratory work.\nInstead, the course focuses on\nconcepts and issues underlying the network, its resources, and access\ntools.\n<p>\nFor example, even with a tool as simple as gopher, one can examine such\nissues as these:  What is a network protocol, why are protocols\nimportant, what protocols are used by gopher as opposed to other\nservices?  Many fundamental issues in systems architecture appear clearly\nwhen examining network-based applications: the interaction of various\nseparate sequential processes, the role of cache and cache management,\nachieving reliability in the face of errors, building systems at\nsuccessive levels of abstraction, various interface issues (both human\nand between routines), and so on.\nNetworked information access systems provide\nconcrete examples which take such concepts out of the realm of\nunmotivated, disconnected abstraction\ninto an arena of broad, immediate discourse.\n<p>\n<H2>Course Structure</H2>\n<ul>\n<li>The course is divided into 3 approximately equal parts,\neach incorporating complementary class and lab sessions.\n<ol>\n<li>The first part will focus on a general conceptual and technical\noverview in classes, based on readings, lectures and discussion.\nThe labs will concentrate on establishing in all participants\nbasic fluency in fundamental electronic communications and\ninformation access tools and techniques.\n<li>The second part will examine the conceptual and technical underpinnings\nof the Internet and the World Wide Web.\nClass work will focus on analytic understanding of fundamental issues\nand concepts in network and information-server architecture.\nLabs will cover specifics of being an information provider.\n<li>The third part of the course will address two or three\nspecialized topics in computer science\nwhose ``practical'' import is manifest\nin networked information discovery and retrieval.\nThe selection of these topics will take into consideration\ninterests expressed by class participants.\n</ol>\n<li>Lab work will be done in structured teams of 2 to 4 students working\nat 1 to 2 adjacent workstations.\n<li>Each student will keep an individual course notebook recording\ncourse activities, questions, observations, homeworks, etc.\nThese notebooks will be reviewed on a regular basis (approximately\nevery other week) and evaluation of them will be a component of\nthe final grade.\n<li>50% of the final grade will be based on homework, projects (including\n    the course notebook described above), and class\n    participation, with class participation counting at least 10% and\n    no more than 20%.\n<li>50% of the final grade will be based on in-class quizzes (30%) and the\n    final exam (20%).  There will be 4 or 5 quizzes.  The lowest score\n    will be discarded.  A quiz missed receives a score of 0.\n</ul>\n<b>Class Participation</b><br>\nClass participation includes both verbal and written communication\nwith the instructional staff and with other students.\nAs hard as it may seem to ask a ``foolish'' question,\nthe most foolish question is the one which remains unasked\nbecause of concern about ``how I will appear to others.''\nEach person in this class should feel ``It is my responsibility\nto say when I do not understand something, because if I know\nenough to know that I do not understand, then surely there must\nbe someone else in the class who is no better off than I am\nand may not even be aware that there is an issue here.\n(Heck, they may not even be able to understand that last sentence!)''\n<p>\n<HR>\n\nYour comments are welcome via e-mail to\n<A HREF=\"mailto:ics1c@ics.uci.edu\">ics1c@ics.uci.edu</A> or using\na form which allows for anonymous comments:\n<FORM METHOD=POST ACTION=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/cgi-bin/zd.cgi\">\n<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=ZD-Method\n        VALUE=\"ZD-Reflect;;file:/Web/doc/X/W6/zd/comment-form.template\">\n<INPUT TYPE=submit NAME=submit VALUE=\"Click to get the Comment Form\">\n<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=SEND-TO VALUE=\"ics1c@ics.uci.edu\">\n<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=DOC-URL \n\tVALUE=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/syllabus.html\">\n<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=DOC-ID\n\tVALUE=\"ICS1C.Syllabus.95\">\n<INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME=DOC-TITLE\n\tVALUE=\"ICS 1C Syllabus, Winter 1995\">\n</FORM>\n<I>Current as of 12 January 1995</I>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
