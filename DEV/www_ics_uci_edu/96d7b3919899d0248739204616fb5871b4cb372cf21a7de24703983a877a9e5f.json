As a\nHumanities major, I have studied the Bible as a intellectual and literary\nsource of knowledge, and now I want to provide a deeper look at the\nreligious and faith aspects as well. I will provide a descriptive\nanalysis of the Church, providing information on literature,\ntraditions, and the liturgy. I also will provide a brief overview of\ndifferences between the Orthodox Christian faith and the Catholic and \nProtestant Christian faiths. <hr>\n<!-----===\n---->\n\n<P>\n\n<H1>A General Overview of Who Is an Orthodox Christian:</H1><BR>\n\nAn <A HREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html\">Orthodox \nChristian</A> takes her or his beliefs from two sources:  \"the Scriptures \nand [the] Sacred Tradition\" (<A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html\">The Orthodox \nChristian</A>).  The Orthodox Christian belongs to the \nbody of Christ, which through time, has transformed into the \"Church of Christ\" (<A \nHREF= \"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html\">The Orthodox \nChristian</A>).  In \nOrthodoxy, this Church of Christ is essentially the accumulation of descendants from the \noriginal congregation \"which was born at the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in \nJerusalem on Pentecost\" (<A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html\">The Orthodox \nChristian</A>).  This first congregation was called \nan <A HREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html\">ecclesia</A>.  \nThe Apostles were the first priests, who then passed on the position and tradition \nto the <A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/intro.html\">priests</A> of \nthe oncoming generations.\n\n<P>\n\n<H2>The Bible in Relation to Holy Tradition in the Orthodox Faith</H2><BR>\n\nIn Orthodoxy, the Bible in only part of the richness of Christian tradition.  \nAlthough Orthodox Christians turn to the Bible for wisdom and guidance, they do \nnot resort only on the Bible for information on how to live.  The Bible, or Holy \nScripture, is only part of the Holy Tradition.  For Orthodox Christians, while the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html\" \n>Holy Scripture</A> is a \"beautiful gem\" (<A \nHREF=\"file://localhost/u3/ea/easu1569/ics.1c/finalpaper.html\">The Bible and Holy \nTradition</A>) and a central part of Orthodoxy, \nit's power will only manifest itself when one places it in the context of the \nlarger <A \nHREF=\"http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html\">Holy \nTradition</A>.\n\n\n<P>\n\n<H2>History of the Orthodox Church</H2><BR>\n\nThe Orthodox church was <A \nHREF=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/activities/ocf/home.html\">founded</A> by \nJesus Christ and His disciples; the \nfaith and rituals continue to grow now for twenty centuries.  Although \nOrthodox Christians exist in other cultures and countries as well, \nmost of them are \"Greek, Russian, Egyptian, Romanian, Serbian, Ukrainian, \nArmenian, Bulgarian, Albanian, Ethiopian, [or] Syrian\" (<A \nHREF=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/activities/ocf/home.html\" >The Orthodox Christian \nFellowship Homepage</A>) in \ntheir <A HREF=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/activities/ocf/home.html\">ethnicity</A>.\n<P>\nOrthodox believers adhere to the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/history/creed.nicene.txt\">Nicene \nCreed</A>, which is \nthe most widely accepted statement used in the Christian faith.  It is a \"Common Ground\" \n(<A \nHREF=\"http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/history/creed.nicene.txt\">The \nNicence Creed</A>) to the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Anglican, \nLutheran, Calvinist, and other Christian churches.  The creed was created to \nsupport strongly the fact that \"Jesus was fully \nGod\" (<A \nHREF=\"http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/text/history/creed.nicene.txt\">The \nNicene Creed</A>).  In other words, He was a part \nof the one God (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) and not just a creation that \nGod made.\n\n<P>\n\n<H2>Some Differences Between the Orthodox Church and the Catholic and \nProtestant Churches</H2><BR>\n\n<P>\n\n<B>The Orthodox and the Protestant Churches</B><BR>\n\nOne of the main differences between the Orthodox and the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html\"> \nProtestant Church</A> lies precisely in the varying weight they place on the Holy \nScriptures.  Both churches adhere to the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html\">\ncentrality\n</A> of the Bible in their faiths.  However, for the Protestant, the Bible is the \nonly source of guidance, while for the Orthodox, the Bible is only part of \nthe Holy \nTradition.  The Orthodox doctrine finds a key problem with the Protestant stance:  \n\"gradually all of Holy Tradition has been stripped away either because someone \ndidn't like this or that piece or perhaps the true beauty of a portion \nwas tarnished and it was tossed away without knowing its true value or \nperhaps a cheap \nsubstitute attempting to replace that which was lost was done away with \netc. until \nall that remains of the Tradition of the Church is the Bible,\" writes <A\nHREF=\"http://www.forthnet.gr/hellas/Orthodox-Page/scripture/pendant.html\">Father \nDavid Moser</A>.\n\n<P>\n\n<B>The Orthodox and the Catholic Churches</B><BR>\n\nThe Orthodox Church differs from the Catholic Church as well:  about 500 \nyears before the reformation split western Europe into Protestants and \nRoman Catholics, the Orthodox protested against the <A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html\">Pope\n</A> and his authority.  The Orthodox had two main reasons for refusing \nthe Pope.  Firstly, they did not agree with his attempts to become \"supreme over the \nchurch\" (<A HREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html\"> \nSome Straight Answers about the Orthodox Church</A>) in the 11th century.  Secondly, they \nwere against the fact \nthat the Pope proposed \"some doctrinal innovations\" (<A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html\">\nSome Straight Answers about the Orthodox Church</A>).  Because the Church \nuntil \nthat point had remained \"unchanged in doctrine and faith since the early Church of the \nApostles\" (<A HREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html\">\nSome Straight Answers about the Orthodox Church </A>), the Orthodox \nrejected the changes of the Pope (and \nthus, of the Roman Catholics).  The Orthodox Church does \nconsider itself \"Catholic,\" however, in another sense; it is \"whole and not confined\" (<A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/reading/questions.html\">Some Straight \nAnswers about the Orthodox Church</A>) in nature.\n\n<P>\n\n<H1>The Coptic Orthodox Church</H1><BR>\n\n<P>\n\n<H2>A Look Into the Coptic Orthodox Church</H2><BR>\n\n<P>\n\nAs previously mentioned, Orthodox Christians are prevalent in several \ndifferent cultures.  Although they are virtually the same in doctrine and \npractice, it will be useful to focus on a particular segment in more \ndetail.  I will focus on the Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt because it \noffers the most information in the internet.\n\n<P>\n\n The Coptic Orthodox Church is a \"very conservative Church,\nwhich preserves most carefully the Christian Faith, in its earliest and purest\nform,  passed on  from generation  to  generation,  unaltered  and true to the\nApostolic doctrine and patterns of worship\" (<A \nHREF=\"ftp://pharos.bu.edu/CN/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt\">Copts \nThrough the Ages</A>).  Furthermore, it is a \"deeply spiritual and even\nmystical Church,  with an emphasis upon holiness,  and the Mysteries of Faith,\nbut at the same time it is a strongly <A \nHREF=\"ftp://pharos.bu.edu/CN/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt\">doctrinal \nChurch</A>\" (<A \nHREF=\"ftp://pharos.bu.edu/CN/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt\">Copts \nThrough the Ages</A>) that not \nonly adheres to the Scripture, but also to the teachings of the holy Apostles.\n\n<P>\n\nThe word <A HREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\"> \nCopt</A> derives from the word \"Aigyptos,\" a Greek word which refers to \nthe first capitol of Ancient Egypt.  However, the modern use of the \nword <A \nHREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Coptic</A> \nrefers to the Egyptian Orthodox Christians.  The Coptic Church is \nbased on <A \nHREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Saint \nMark's teachings</A>.  The religion is very old, for \"Saint \nMark...brought Christianity to Egypt\" (<A \nHREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\"> \nThe Christian Coptic Orthodox Church of Egypt</A>) during the first centuty, only a \ndozen years after Jesus ascended into heaven.  The <A \nHREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Coptic \nreligion</A> is authentic in that it dates back almost to the beginning of\nthe Orthodox Church, but also in that some have discovered part of <A \nHREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Saint John's \ngospel</A> written in the Coptic language.\n\n<P>\n\n<H2>The Coptic Church's Contributions to the Orthodox Faith</H2><BR>\n\n<P>\n\nThe Copts have made numerous contributions to the Orthodox faith \nas a whole.  Saint Mark was one of the first contributers, for he \"had  \nopened  the  first  Christian\nCatechetical School in Alexandria for the instruction of the new converts\" (<A \nHREF=\"ftp://pharos.bu.edu/CN/articles/CoptsThroughTheAges.txt\">Copts \nThrough the Ages</A>).  Other Coptic saints made lasting contributions as well.  \nFor \ninstance,  <A HREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Saint \nAthanasius</A>, a Copt \nand the Pope of Alexandria in 381 A.D., authored the above mentioned \n<A HREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Nicene Creed</A>. \nFurthermore,  <A\nHREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">monasticism</A> \ngrew out of Egypt, \nand subscribed to the character of \"humbleness and submission\" (<A\nHREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Nicene Creed</A>).  \nLater, <A HREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Saint \nAnthony</A>, a Copt, was the first Christian monk during the last years of \nthe third century.  Also a\nCopt,  <A\nHREF=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu/faculty/best/pub/cn/Home.html\">Saint \nPachom</A> later established the rules of monasticism.\n\n<P>\n\n<H1>Orthodoxy on the Internet</H1><BR>\n \n<P>\n\nOrthodox Christians have offered their knowledge and information on the \ninternet in various ways.  Different priests and other Orthodox Christians \nhave submitted papers, homepages, and more online.  One who is interested in \nthe Orthodox religion can research specific documents on the <A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/Orthodox.html\">Orthodox \nPage</A>.  This document provides information about Orthodoxy; \nfurthermore, it links one to other Orthodox sources online.\n\n<P>\n\nOn the internet one can find an exact copy of the <A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/liturgy/liturgy.html\">Divine \nLiturgy</A>  in its entirety. This includes both what the deacon says and \nwhat the congregation responds.  One also can find a large collection of \ngeneral, as well as <A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/prayers/prayers.html\">Orthodox \nprayers</A> from which to choose.  The list includes The Lord's Prayer, The \nCreed, Morning Prayers, Prayers at Mealtime, Evening Prayers, and prayers by \ndifferent saints (<A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/prayers/prayers.html\">Orthodox \nPrayers</A>).  In addition, one also can view <A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/icons/icons.html\">Orthodox \nIcons</A> on screen, both with and without inline images.  \n\n<P>\n\nOne document addresses and answers <A \nHREF=\"file://localhost/u3/ea/easu1569/ics.1c/finalpaper.html\">specific \nquestions</A> that one might have about the Orthodox \nfaith.  Such questions include, for instance, \"Do the Orthodox worship \npictures when they worship icons?\" and \"Do you have to confess your sins to a \npriest and why?\"  Such fundamental questions that one might have about \nOrthodoxy are ideal to answer on the internet because the answers are easy \nto access and are open for any wandering mind to explore--both Orthodox and \nnon-Orthodox. \n\n<P>\n\nFurthermore, The Orthodox keep an update on the internet, with \ndocuments on the <A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/news/news.html\">Orthodox \nNews Page</A> and on the <A \nHREF=\"http://nikon.ssl.berkeley.edu/~dv/orthodox/info/info.html\">Orthodox \nInformation Page</A>.\n\n<P>\n\nInterestingly, while information exists about Orthodoxy as a whole, one could \nnot access easily sources on Orthodox churches from particular \ncultures.  As is evident in the depth of analysis of my paper, the <A \nHREF=\"http://webcrawler.cs.washington.edu/cgi-bin/WebQuery?orthodox+christian\">\nCoptic Orthodox Christians</A>  \nmade available the most information about their religion on the internet.\n\n<P>\n\nCurrent as of \nMarch 11, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\"> ICS 1C</a>\n\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
