I'll try to keep the argument as\nintuitive and geometrical as possible, although that's easier said than\ndone.\n\nFirst, I'll show that the total curvature of _any_ closed curve (not\nnecessarily knotted) is at least 2*pi.  The lower bound for knotted curves\nuses the same idea.\n\nLet c be a smooth, simple, closed curve in R^3.  Think of c as a smooth\nmap from (an open set containing) the closed interval [0,r] into R^3,\nparameterized by arc length (that is, |c'(t)|=1 for all t in [0,r]).\nThus r is the length of the curve, and\n\n     c(0) = c(r),\n     c'(0) = c'(r),\n     c''(0) = c''(r),\n     etc.\n\nLet k(t) be the curvature of c at \"time\" t (0 <U>&lt;</U> t <U>&lt;</U> r).\nIf c is planar, then its total curvature must be at least 2*pi (equality\nholding when c is convex) in order for its tangent vector to wind around\nonce.  Thus we can assume c cannot lie in any single plane.\n\nFor all t in [0,r], translate the unit tangent vector c'(t) back to the\norigin.  As we go around the curve, this vector sweeps out its own curve\nu on the unit sphere (i.e., u maps [0,r] into S^2 with u(t) = c'(t)).\n\nNow note that the total curvature of c equals the total _length_ of u.\nThis is because for all t in [0,r]\n\n     k(t) = |c''(t)| = |u'(t)|\n\nso\n     /r          /r\n    |           |\n    | k(t)dt  = | |u'(t)|dt  =  total length of u.\n    |           |\n   / 0         / 0\n\nThus it suffices to show that u has length at least 2*pi.  Now for t in\n[0,r], define H_t to be the hemisphere of S^2 centered at u(t).  That\nis,\n\n    H_t  =  { v in R^3 :  |v| = 1  and  u(t).v <U>&gt;</U> 0 }.\n\nI like to think of H_t as a cap on the sphere, moving around with the\nvector u(t), and at each time t, H_t covers exactly half of the sphere.\n\nThe proof boils down to two main points: First, as H_t moves around, it must\neventually cover the entire sphere.  That is, every point on the sphere\nmust be covered by H_t for some t in [0,r].  Second, H_t can only cover\nnew points so fast (new area covered is proportional to |u'(t)|).  Thus,\nfor H_t to cover the entire sphere, u must have some minimum length, which\nturns out to be 2*pi.\n\nTo be more precise, say that a point v in S^2 is _painted_ at time t_0 if\n0 &lt; t_0 <U>&lt;</U> r, and v passes from being uncovered by H_t to being covered by\nH_t at time t = t_0.  That is, immediately before t_0, v is not in H_t,\nand at t_0, v is in H_t.\n\n1.   I claim that for every v in S^2 there is a t_0 in (0,r] such that\n     v is painted at t_0.\n\n[Proof]: Suppose not.  Then there is a point v_0 on the unit sphere that\neither always remains covered or always remains uncovered by H_t.  Assume\nwithout loss of generality that v_0 is always covered (if v_0 is always\nuncovered, look at its antipodal point).  But this means that v_0.u(t)\n<U>&gt;</U> 0 for all t in [0,r].  Therefore, c'(t) always has a nonnegative\ncomponent in the v_0 direction, so if c(t) is to loop back on itself\n(c(0) = c(r)), c'(t) must always be perpendicular to v_0 (i.e.,\nc'(t).v_0 vanishes everywhere).  Then c is planar, contrary to our\nassumption.  Q.E.D.\n\n2.   H_t paints new area on S^2 at a rate equal to 2*|u'(t)|.  That is,\n     if A(t) is the area of that portion of the sphere painted before time\n     t, then A(t) can increase at a rate of at most 2*|u'(t)|.\n\n[Handwave proof]:  Consider a small interval [t,t+dt].  Within the\ninterval, u moves almost in a straight line (remember, u is smooth).\nThe points that are painted in this interval approximately constitute\na section of the sphere swept out by the advancing boundary of H_t.\nThis section is bounded by two great semicircles with the same endpoint,\nwith maximum width |u'(t)|*dt.  The area of this section is approximately\n2*|u'(t)|*dt.  (For example, think of u taking a great circle route around\nthe sphere; its total length is 2*pi, and the total area swept out is 4*pi.)\nTaking the limit as dt approaches 0 gives the result.  Q.E.D.\n\nNow the main result for (unknotted) closed curves:\nAt time t=0, no points are painted (A(0) = 0).  At time t=r, all the\npoints on the sphere are painted (A(r) = 4*pi) by claim 1.  Thus u must\nhave total length at least 2*pi by claim 2.  Q.E.D.\n\nNow suppose c is knotted.  I claim that each point on the sphere is\npainted _twice_ (two coats :-).\n\nSuppose there is a point v_0 on S^2 which is only painted once.  By\nreparameterizing the curve c (actually a cyclic shift), we can assume\nv_0 is painted at some point t_1, and v_0 is uncovered for all t in\n(0,t_1), and is covered for all t in [t_1,r].  In this case, c has the\nfollowing behaviour with respect to the direction v_0: at t=0, c starts\nmoving with a component in the negative v_0 direction and keeps moving\nin this direction until t_1, where it turns around and moves in the\npositive (actually nonnegative) v_0 direction until t=r.  (Its motion in\nthe other two orthogonal directions may be arbitrary.)\n\nThe curve c therefore cannot be knotted: it resembles a circular\nrubber band that is anchored at opposite ends and twisted.  It may twist\nand turn arbitrarily in the middle, between the two ends, but it can\nalways be unwound into a circle again.\n\nSo if c is knotted, the sphere must be entirely painted twice, making\nthe total area to be covered 8*pi.  By claim (2) above, the spherical\ncurve u must have total length at least 4*pi, thus the total curvature\nof c is at least 4*pi.
