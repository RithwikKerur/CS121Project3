We present techniques for\nauthenticating data structures that represent graphs and collections of\ngeometric objects. In our model, a data structure maintained by a\ntrusted source is mirrored at distributed directories that answer\nqueries and provide proof of correctness. Our work has applications to\nthe authentication of network management systems and geographic\ninformation systems.\n</p>\n\n<p>(Based\non <a href=\"http://www.cs.bu.edu/~nikos/papers/authDataStr.pdf\">a\npaper</a> by\nMichael T.
