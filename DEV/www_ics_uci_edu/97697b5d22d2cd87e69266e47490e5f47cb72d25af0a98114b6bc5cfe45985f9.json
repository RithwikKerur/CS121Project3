During\r\na crisis, responding organizations confront grave uncertainties in making\r\n critical decisions. They need to gather situational information (e.g., \r\n state of the civil, transportation and information infrastructures), \r\n together with information about available resources (e.g., medical \r\n facilities,  rescue and law enforcement units). There is a strong correlation \r\n between the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of the information available to the decision-makers, \r\n and the quality of their decisions. Dramatic improvements in the speed \r\n and accuracy at which information about the crisis flows through the \r\n disaster response networks has the potential to revolutionize crisis response, \r\n saving human lives and property.\r\n \r\nThis chapter highlights some of the key information technology challenges \r\nbeing addressed in the Project RESCUE, with a particular focus on situational \r\nawareness technologies. Appreciating the IT challenges in improving \r\ncrisis response requires a thorough understanding of how communication \r\nand control networks form among responding organizations, and how the \r\nresponse process is organized. Since the crisis domain might be new to a \r\nlarge number of readers, we begin by first briefly summarizing the crisis \r\nresponse process. This is done to set the stage for a discussion of the \r\nchallenges being addressed by RESCUE and particularly the situational \r\nawareness thrust within it.</p>  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<p> \r\n<H3>Keywords:</H3>  \r\nSAT, ITR-RESCUE, crisis management, situational awareness, spatial awareness, spatial uncertainty, domain awareness, human as sensor, community input\r\n</p>  \r\n<BR>\r\n  \r\n<p>\r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3>  \r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/SV07_dvk.pdf\">SV07_dvk.pdf</A><BR> \r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?SV07_dvk\" width=1 height=1>  \r\n</p>  \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3> \r\n<pre>@incollection{SV07::dvk,\r\n  author     = {Naveen Ashish and Dmitri V.\\ Kalashnikov and Sharad Mehrotra and \r\n                Nalini Venkatasubramanian and Ron Eguchi and Rajesh Hegde and Padhraic Smyth},\r\n  editor     = {Hsinchun Chen and Edna Reid and Joshua Sinai and Andrew Silke and Boaz Ganoz},\r\n  title      = {Situational Awareness Technologies for Disaster Response},\r\n  booktitle  = {Terrorism Informatics: Knowledge Management and Data Mining for Homeland Security},\r\n  publisher  = {Springer},\r\n  month      = dec,\r\n  year       = 2007\r\n}\r\n \r\n</pre>\r\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/index.html\">Back to Kalashnikov's homepage</A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR> \r\n</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
