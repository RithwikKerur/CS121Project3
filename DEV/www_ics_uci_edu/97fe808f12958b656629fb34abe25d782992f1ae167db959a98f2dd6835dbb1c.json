In rooted trees the edge\nlength between an ancestor and its descendants can represent the time,\nor sometimes genetic distance, between them.  We study the problem of\nconstructing an upward planar orthogonal drawing of a tree in which the\nvertical length of each edge is fixed and the goal is to minimize the\nwidth of the drawing. We show that even for binary trees this is\nNP-hard, but if the ordering of the children is fixed then it can be\nresolved in polynomial time.  Finally we provide a heuristic algorithm\nfor solving it with good width in practice (work in progress).</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Michael T.
