each enhancement should result in the best code possible,\r\n    before continuing to the next enhancement.\r\n  Ultimately, this strategy will save you time compared to the strategy often\r\n    used by students: ignore style until the program is completely written.\r\n  This is a penny-wise, pound-foolish strategy.\r\n  It is much harder to \"finish\" a  poorly-styled program, because it is harder\r\n    to read and understand it; (software) engineers must learn to practice\r\n    techniques that overcome human nature; this is one example.\r\n  <p>\r\n  In the real world, companies have their own style guidelines, which all their\r\n    programmers must follow (see Vermuelen's book or Scott Ambler's\r\n    <a href=\"../../../common/handouts/javaCodingStandards.pdf\">Java Coding\r\n    Standards</a>).\r\n  In this way, code written by different programmers is consistent (and \r\n    therefore more easily readable by other programmers).\r\n  So, it is not unreasonable for me to ask you to write in a certain style, as\r\n    consistently as you can.\r\n  <p>\r\n  We will use four general principles to discuss issues in programming style (backwards, they\r\n    are the acronym CLAN).\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Names\r\n    <li>Alignment\r\n    <li>Locality\r\n    <li>Comments\r\n  </ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Good Names -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Names\"><hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Good Names</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  Programmers get to choose identifiers that name variables (and as we will\r\n    see later in this course methods, parameters, classes, exceptions, etc).\r\n  We should choose descriptive names.\r\n  Yes, we should also try to choose short names, but descriptiveness is more\r\n    important.\r\n  A long descriptive name is better than a short unclear one.\r\n  Of course, a short descriptive name is optimal.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Beginning programmers typically choose names that are too short: they\r\n    abbreviate too much, or use just single letter names.\r\n  Rather than declaring <b><pre>int qs; //qs means quarters</pre></b> declare\r\n    a variable named <b>quarters</b> (and then, if necessary, comment on some\r\n    other aspect of the name -like its units).\r\n  Using longer names requires a bit more typing (which costs some time) and\r\n    takes longer to read (ditto) but it makes it much easier for you to\r\n    <b>understand</b> your program as you are enhancing/debugging it (which\r\n    saves much much much more time).\r\n  Examine the names that I use in my sample and solution programs and mimic\r\n    them.\r\n  <p>\r\n  So far, we have learned the following Java naming conventions.\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Names of Variable start with lower-case letters, and use upper-case \r\n          letters at the start of each word in the name (\"camel-style\"):\r\n          e.g., <b>dartsInCircle</b>.\r\n    <li>Names of classes start with upper-case letters,and use use other\r\n          upper-case letters at the start of each word in the name: e.g.,\r\n          <b>StringTokenizer</b>.\r\n    <li>Names of <b>public static final<b> fields are written in all\r\n          upper-case, and use underscores to separate each word in the name:\r\n          e.g., <b>PI</b>, <b>SPEED_OF_LIGHT</b>.\r\n  </ul>\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Alignment/Indenting -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Alignment\"><hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Alignment<br>(indenting)</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  Generally, we use whitespace to present our programs (to humans, not\r\n    computers) in an easy to  read and understand form.\r\n  Remember that adding extra whitespace doesn't affect the meaning of our\r\n    programs (the sequence of tokens is still the same), but it does affect\r\n    how a program is displayed in the editor while we are reading it.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Using extra whitespace will make the program \"longer\" but easier to read.\r\n  In fact, in one early style of written English (scriptio continua), words\r\n    were strung together with no intervening whitespace.\r\n  Itwasstillreadablebutveryslowanddifficulttocomprehend.\r\n  Sometimes smaller isn't simpler.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Alignment involves mostly using horizontal whitespace.\r\n  The most important use of alignment is showing which statements are\r\n    controlled by which control structures, with the controlled statements\r\n    indented to appear <i>inside</i> the statements that control them.\r\n  This relationship is the essence of using control structures, so\r\n    highlighting it is critical.\r\n  <p>\r\n  There is a pattern in how we write control structures.\r\n  For example in the block after <b>main()</b>, all statements are indented at the same level.\r\n  <b><pre>  public static void main (String[] args) {\r\n     statement<sub>1</sub>\r\n     statement<sub>2</sub>\r\n     ...\r\n     statement<sub>n</sub>\r\n  }</pre></b>\r\n  A typical indentation for these statements (and others inside control\r\n    structures, illustrated below) is 2-4 spaces: one space is too little and\r\n     more than four is too much (the Goldilocks principle again).\r\n  In fact, the indent icons in the editor (red left-arrow followed by text or\r\n    red right-arrow followed by text) make it easy to select multiple lines of\r\n    text and indent (or outdent) them 2 spaces at a time.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Likewise, in an <b>if</b> statement we use the following forms (depending on\r\n    whether or not the statement contolled by the <b>if</b> is a block)\r\n  <b><pre>  if (test)\r\n    statement<sub>T</sub>\r\n\r\n  if (test) {\r\n    statement<sub>T1</sub>\r\n    statement<sub>T2</sub>\r\n    ...\r\n    statement<sub>Tn</sub>\r\n  }</pre></b>\r\n  For an <b>if/else</b> statement, there are four possiblities (based on the\r\n    absence or presense of blocks).\r\n  From simplest to most complicated, they are:\r\n  <b><pre>  if (test)\r\n    statement<sub>T</sub>\r\n  else\r\n    statement<sub>F</sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n  if (test)\r\n    statement<sub>T</sub>\r\n  else{\r\n    statement<sub>F1</sub>\r\n    ...\r\n    statement<sub>Fn</sub>\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\n  if (test) {\r\n    statement<sub>T1</sub>\r\n    ...\r\n    statement<sub>Tn</sub>\r\n  }else\r\n    statement<sub>F</sub>\r\n\r\n\r\n  if (test) {\r\n    statement<sub>T1</sub>\r\n    ...\r\n    statement<sub>Tn</sub>\r\n  }else{\r\n    statement<sub>F1</sub>\r\n    ...\r\n    statement<sub>Fn</sub>\r\n  }</pre></b>\r\n  I like to write <b>}else{</b> on the same line, but Vermeulen likes to write\r\n<b><pre>  }\r\n  else{</pre></b>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Many programmers adopt a style that ALWAYS use blocks in <b>if</b>\r\n    statements (and loops), even if they  contain just ONE statement.\r\n  On the positive side, such an approach makes it very easy to add/remove\r\n    statements (when debugging/enhancing programs), because the block is\r\n    already there; otherwise going from one to more statements requires\r\n    adding a block, and going from multiple to one statement requires removing\r\n    the block.\r\n  On the negative side, blocks, when they are unneccessary, make the program a\r\n    harder to read.\r\n  So, choose whichever of these options you think is better, but be consistent\r\n    with your choice.\r\n  I like \"blocks where necessary\" but Vermeulen likes \"always blocks\".\r\n  <p>\r\n  Finally, identically to <b>if</b> statements, we align a <b>for</b> loop by\r\n    indenting the statement that is their body.\r\n  <b><pre>  for (;;)\r\n     statement\r\n\r\n  for (;;) {\r\n    statement<sub>1</sub>\r\n    statement<sub>2</sub>\r\n    ...\r\n    statement<sub>n</sub>\r\n  }</pre></b>\r\n  Almost all interesting loops use a block for their bodies.\r\n  Very few have trivially simple loops, and loops that have one\r\n    <b>try-catch</b> statement in their bodies (<b>try-catch</b> has most of\r\n    its code in its <b>try</b> block.\r\n  <p>\r\n  I cannot overemphasize how important it is to use proper alignment in control\r\n    structures.\r\n  A major source of programming errors for beginners is not understanding which\r\n    statements are controlled by which control structures: these can get\r\n    tricky with expression statements inside <b>if</b> statements inside loops.\r\n  Proper alignment makes such relationships much simpler to see.\r\n  I have seen students spend 2 hours trying to debug a program; at which point\r\n    then finally spend 10 minutes aligning its statements (because I refuse to\r\n    help them until they do), and then they solve their problem by themselves \r\n    in 1 minute.\r\n  If you expect to debug your programs, it is imperative that you use proper\r\n    alignment whenever you add/remove code to/from them.\r\n  <p>\r\n  You can get Eclipse to automatically indent your code:\r\n    select the code to be aligned and then select the <b>Source</b>\r\n    pull-down menu and the <b>Correct Indentation</b> option.\r\n  (A faster way to do this is ctrl/a then ctrl/i: the first selects\r\n   all the code in a file, the second realigns it.)\r\n  Use this feature repeatedly as you write your code, to make sure it is\r\n    always clearly indented, so you can see which control structures\r\n    control which statements.\r\n  You can even change how Eclipse does indentation (and more generally\r\n    presents your program in an editor) by changing information in\r\n    <b>Windows | Preferences</b>, but doing so is beyond the scope of\r\n    this course (but feel free to disclose <b>Java | CodeStyle</b> and\r\n     <b>Java | Editor</b>) and experiment.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Another use of alignment occurs when declaring a sequence of variables;\r\n    rather than doing so haphazardly, we can align the types, names, initial\r\n    values, and comments.\r\n  <b><pre>  int    game      =  0;    //Current game being played\r\n  int    maxGames  = 10;    //Limit on games for one customer\r\n  int    winCount  =  0;    //For statistics (see WL_Ratio too)\r\n  int    loseCount =  0;\r\n  double winLoseRatio;      //Calculated at the end of a session</pre></b>\r\n  Some programmers think that this kind of alignment is too much trouble,\r\n    because if you add/remove declarations, you must realign them; I think the\r\n    effort is worth it.\r\n  So please examine all the alignment that I use in my sample and solution\r\n    programs and mimic them.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Locality -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Locality\"><hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Locality<br>(paragraphing)</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  Locality is the most subjective of the style rules.\r\n  It involves mostly adding extra vertical whitespace (blank lines).\r\n  By grouping statements together and then placing blank lines between groups,\r\n    we create the programming equivalent of paragraphs in prose writing (where\r\n    each paragraph contains related sentences).\r\n  In a written paper, students would never put all the sentences into one long\r\n    paragraph; likewise, students would never make every sentence into its own\r\n    paragraph.\r\n  So, we should always use a more reasonable grouping (some number of related\r\n    lines) for paragraphing in our programs.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Typically, each code group should contain a half-dozen statements.\r\n  The magic number 7+/-2 is also used for psychological reasons: it represents\r\n    the number of items typically usable in the brain's short-term memory.\r\n  Whenever a large number of statements appear in a block of code, use blank\r\n    lines to group them into a smaller number of related sequences.\r\n  We can write a preface comment (see below) that acts as a topic sentence for\r\n     the paragraph of code.\r\n  <p>\r\n  A <b>for</b> loop and <b>try-catch</b> almost always start their own group;\r\n    so do complicated <b>if</b> statements.\r\n  Locality is more art than rules; I encourage you to examine the groupings\r\n    that I use in my sample and solution programs and try to critique and\r\n    ultimately emulate them.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Comments -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Comments\"><hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Comments</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  We document our programs with comments.\r\n  While we try to express ourselves as well as we can with Java code, there is\r\n     always other useful information about a program that we would like \r\n     communicate to programmers reading our code (including ourself, while\r\n     debugging it, or at some future date when we are enhancing our code).\r\n  Such information is for programmers, not the computer: not the instructions \r\n    saying HOW the code works (that is for the programmer and computer), but \r\n    WHAT the program does and WHY it does it (that way).\r\n  We supply this information in comments. \r\n  <p>\r\n  There are a few different categories of comments that frequently reappear.\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Preface comments act as a topic-sentence, describing a group of related\r\n         statements that directly follow the comment.\r\n        Use the locality principle with such comments:\r\n        there should be more blank lines separating the comment from the code\r\n           before it (which it doesn't describe) than blank lines separating\r\n           the comment from the code after it (which it does describe).\r\n        Taken together, and indented appropriately, these commments provide an\r\n          outline of the program.\r\n        Every loop should have a preface comment; for other statements, comment\r\n          them as necessary.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <li>Sidebar comments appear on the same line, after some statement.\r\n        They help explain that statement; sometimes a series of sidebar\r\n           comments will also help outline the computation.\r\n        Use alignment so that all the sidebar comments are aligned: that makes\r\n          it very easy to have the code separated from the comments (more use \r\n          of the locality rule).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <li>\"Sandwhich comments\" directly preface and suffix some statement (with\r\n          no blank lines lines).\r\n        Use a sandwhich comment to make the <b>if/break;</b> statements\r\n          terminating a long loop easy to locate.\r\n <pre><b>  //////////////////////\r\n  if (index == maxIndex)\r\n    break;\r\n  //////////////////////</b></pre>\r\n     <p>\r\n     <li>Avoid mingling comments within code; separate them (horizontally or\r\n           vertically) for clarity.\r\n         In the following example use the FORMER side-bar comment, not the\r\n         latter, code (both have the same tokens, when comments are treated\r\n         as white-space).\r\n <pre><b>  d = v*t;  //distance = velocity times time\r\n  d /*distance*/ = v /*velocity*/ * t /*time*/;</b>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  Like the other rules of good style, comments are best included while the\r\n     program is being written, not after it is working.\r\n  I find and correct many errors while writing comments, because I am focusing\r\n     on the code while writing about it.\r\n  Again, many students approach writing comments as something to do AFTER the\r\n    program is complete, which ultimately slows them down.\r\n  Examine the comments that I use in my sample and solution programs and try\r\n    to critique and ultimately emulate them.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Misc -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Misc\"><hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Miscellaneous Style Rules</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  Finally, here are some miscellaneous style rules\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Use local variables whenever they clarify the code, keeping expression\r\n          sizes managable;
