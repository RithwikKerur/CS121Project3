Martin lists the following 26 equivalents to the\n    Parallel Postulate within absolute geometry:\n\n    Proposition A.  Euclid's Parallel Postulate: If A and D are points\n\ton the same side of segment(BC) such that measure(angle(ABC)) +\n\tmeasure(angle(BCD)) &lt; pi, then ray(BA) intersects ray(CD).\n\n    Proposition B.  Euclid's Proposition I.29: If A and D are points on\n\tthe same side of line(BC) and line(BA) || line(CD), then\n\tmeasure(angle(ABC)) + measure(angle(BCD)) = pi.\n\n    Proposition C.  Euclid's Proposition I.30: l || m and m || n\n\timplies l || n for lines l, m, n.  (Lines parallel to a given\n\tline are parallel.)\n\n    Proposition D.  Contrapositive to Euclid's Proposition I.30: A\n\tthird line intersecting one of two parallel lines intersects\n\tthe other.\n\n    Proposition E.  Euclid's Proposition I.31, Playfair's Parallel\n\tPostulate:  If a point P is off line l, then there exists a\n\tunique line through P parallel to l.\n\n    Proposition F.  A line perpendicular to one of two parallel lines\n\tis perpendicular to the other.\n\n    Proposition G.  l || m, r is perpendicular to l, and s is\n\tperpendicular to m implies r || s for lines l, m, r, s.\n\n    Proposition H.  The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a\n\ttriangle are concurrent.\n\n    Proposition I.  There exists a circle passing through any three\n\tnoncollinear points.\n\n    Proposition J.  There exists a point equidistant from any three\n\tnoncollinear points.\n\n    Proposition K.  A line intersecting and perpendicular to one ray of\n\tan acute angle intersects the other ray.\n\n    Proposition L.  Through any point in the interior of an angle there\n\texists a line intersecting both rays of the angle not at the\n\tvertex.\n\n    Proposition M.  Euclid's Proposition I.32:  The sum of the measures\n\tof the angles of any triangle is pi.  The measure of an exterior\n\tangle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the\n\tremote interior angles.\n\n    Proposition N.  Theorem of Thales:  If point C is off segment(AB),\n\tbut on the circle with diameter segment(AB), then angle(ABC) is\n\tright.\n\n    Proposition O.  If angle(ABC) is right, then C is on the circle with\n\tdiameter segment(AB)&gt;\n\n    Proposition P.  The perpendicular bisectors of the legs of a right\n\ttriangle intersect.\n\n    Proposition Q.  l is perpendicular to r, r is perpendicular to s, and\n\ts is perpendicular to m implies l intersects m for all l, m, r, s.\n\n    Proposition R.  There exists an acute angle such that every line\n\tintersecting and perpendicular to one ray of the angle intersects\n\tthe other ray.\n\n    Proposition S.  There exists an acute angle such that every point\n\tin the interior of the angle is on a line intersecting both\n\trays of the angle.\n\n    Proposition T.  There exists one triangle such that the sum of the\n\tmeasures of its angles is pi.\n\n    Proposition U.  There exists one triangle with defect 0.  [The defect\n\tof a triangle is pi less the sum of the measures of the angles of\n\tthe triangle.  This is a restatement of Proposition T].\n\n    Propositoin V.  Saccheri's Hypothesis of the Right Angle:  There\n\texists a rectangle.  [The Hypothesis of the Acute (Obtuse) Angle:\n\tThere exists a quarilateral with two adjacent right angles and\n\ttwo adjacent acute (obtuse) angles.  These apply to the hyperbolic\n\tand elliptic planes, respectively.]\n\n    Proposition W.  There exist two lines l and m such that l is\n\tequidistant from m [all points of l are at a constant positive\n\tdistance from m].\n\n    Proposition X.  If three angles of a quadrilateral are right, then\n\tso is the fourth.\n\n    Proposition Y.  There is some line l and some point P off l such that\n\ta unique line parallel to l passes through P.\n\n    Proposition Z.  There exist a pair of similar noncongruent triangles.\n\n-- \nDavid W.
