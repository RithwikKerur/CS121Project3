Michael Mealling stated that a small group of people\nuse LDAP for real time systems - that might be it! Lots of guessing but\nno reliable results.}\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> What about LDAP and XML?\n<br><b>Bob Morgan:</b> There is an effort called DSML (Directory Service\nMark-up Language) - It's LDAP in XML. They have a Web site, DSML.org. If\nthere is an application that is inclined to be XML oriented, the directory\nservice can be used to access that application.\n<p>{Ed: Some joking around in audience.}\n<p><b>Carl Ellison:</b> The bigger the directory, the harder to find somebody\n\u2026 {missed some discussion} \u2026 categories. Can you see directories being\nused both ways? Do you disagree with my assumptions [the assumptions of\nmy talk]? None of your examples explain my \"Boss\" example.\n<p><b>Bob Morgan:</b> If there is anything to distinguish between them,\nit's fine.\n<p><b>Carl Ellison:</b> Now about access permissions?\n<br><b>Bob Morgan:</b> Your boss does have access.\n<p>{Ed: Some discussions about access/permission problems.}\n<p>{Ed: Notes on the following discussion don't distinguish the speakers\nwell.}\n<p><b>Carl Ellision:</b> Are big directories doomed to fail? how exactly\nare the directories to be used ?\n<br><b>A:</b> I envision use of directories in an organization .. give\nme some people in the purchasing agents in a particular dept in an org.\n<br><b>Q:</b> How about give me the email address of John Wilson (if there\nare many of them in an organization)\n<br><b>A:</b> Maybe a decent directory page will be able to have enough\ninfo about the person to uniquely identify him\u2026\n<br><b>Q:</b> So you need RICH enough information about that person?\n<br><b>A:</b> Maybe .. that info should be available through the org\u2026\n<br><b>Q: </b>Maybe restrict the info only to the boss who can access the\ninformation about the employee?\n<br><b>A:</b> Vague&nbsp; aaahhh\u2026\u2026.\n<br><b>Q:</b> Who wants to type in all that high level info into you Palm\nPilot?\n<p><b>Jim Whitehead:</b> What is the experience with hierarchies in LDAP?\n<br><b>Bob Morgan:</b> No particular hierarchies, more linkages. Even for\nthings like maintaining information about a router .. there is a representation\nproblem there .. lots of things, and lots of links expressing the relationships\nbetween the things \u2026 Referential integrity and all that kind of stuff \u2026\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
