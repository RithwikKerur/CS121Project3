The problem is of tremendous importance in\nthe emerging field of complexity theory within $\\mathsf{P}$, and it is in\nparticular open whether it admits an algorithm of complexity $O(n^c)$\nwith $c<\\lceil\\frac{k}{2}\\rceil$. Inspired by an algorithm due to Meiser\n(1993), we show that there exist linear decision trees and algebraic\ncomputation trees of depth $O(n^3\\log^2{n})$ solving\n$k$-SUM. Furthermore, we show that there exists a randomized algorithm\nthat runs in $\\tilde{O}(n^{\\lceil\\frac{k}{2}\\rceil+8})$ time, and\nperforms $O(n^3\\log^2{n})$ linear queries on the input. Thus, we show\nthat it is possible to have an algorithm with a runtime almost identical\n(up to the +8) to the best known algorithm but for the first time also\nwith the number of queries on the input a polynomial that is independent\nof $k$. The $O(n^3\\log^2{n})$ bound on the number of linear queries is\nalso a tighter bound than any known algorithm solving $k$-SUM, even\nallowing unlimited total time outside of the queries. By simultaneously\nachieving few queries to the input without significantly sacrificing\nruntime vis-\u00c3\u00a0-vis known algorithms, we deepen the understanding of this\ncanonical problem which is a cornerstone of complexity-within-$\\mathsf{P}$. We\nalso consider a range of tradeoffs between the number of terms involved\nin the queries and the depth of the decision tree. In particular, we\nprove that there exist $o(n)$-linear decision trees of depth\n$\\tilde{O}(n^3)$ for the $k$-SUM problem.</p>\n\n<p>(Based\non <a href=\"http://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/6376/\">a paper\nby Jean Cardinal, John Iacono, and Aur&eacute;lien Ooms from ESA\n2016</a>.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ISO-8859-1"}
