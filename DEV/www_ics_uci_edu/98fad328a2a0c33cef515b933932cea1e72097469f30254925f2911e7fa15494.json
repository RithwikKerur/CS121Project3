For instance, a square may be partitioned into four\npolygonal pieces, which can be rearranged to form an equilateral\ntriangle of the same area.  This idea was used by Hilbert to develop an\naxiomatic theory of plane area.  Dissection has some potential\napplication to random generation of points; it is easy to generate\nuniformly distributed points in a square, so by dissecting the square to\nanother shape one can generate points in that shape.  Dissection is also\nclosely related to the Banach-Tarski paradox (which concerns itself with\nsimilar set-theoretic partitions).  But problems of dissection also have\nmore recreational aspects, concerned with minimizing the number of\npieces in dissections of specific shapes.\n\n<P>I am interested here in a different but closely related problem:\npartitioning a polygon or group of polygons into a dissection such that\nthe pieces can be rearranged to tile the plane.  Each piece must be used\nwith a density proportional to its area (otherwise one could just take a\nsquare out of the middle of one polygon and not use the other pieces).\nAny polygon can be dissected and rearranged to form a unit-width\nrectangle, so any group of polygons has a <I>dissection tiling</I>.\nTilings have been used directly for constructing dissections (by\noverlaying two tilings with the same fundamental domain), but they also\nare useful for understanding n-to-one dissections in the limit as n\ngrows large -- the number of pieces can be approximated by kn+O(sqrt n)\nwhere k is the average pieces/polygon in a dissection tiling.  This sort\nof averaging allows different copies of a polygon to be cut differently;\nfor instance we can cut two pentagons into a dissection tiling averaging\n1.5 pieces/polygon whereas the best one could do with a single polygon\nwould be 2.  I depict below the best dissection tilings I know of (in\nterms of this average) for various regular polygons, star polygons, and\ngroups of polygons.  Since this emphasis is somewhat different from\nprevious work on the subject, many of the dissections here are new.\n\n<P>\nTopics:\n<A HREF=\"#3\">triangles</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#3\">squares</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#5\">pentagons</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#3\">hexagons</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#9\">heptagons</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#8\">octagons</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#9\">nonagons</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#s6\">six-point stars</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#s8\">eight-point stars</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#s9\">nine-point stars</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#5x\">pentagons and decagons</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#5s\">pentagons and stars</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#8s\">octagons and stars</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#3d\">three dimensions</A> --\n<A HREF=\"#bib\">bibliography</A>.\n\n<A NAME=\"3\">\n<H2>Triangles, Squares, and Hexagons</H2></A>\n\nThese all tile the plane without dissection.\n\n<A NAME=\"5\">\n<H2>Pentagons</H2></A>\n\nIf one is given a single pentagon as input, the best one could hope to do\nin a dissection tiling would be to cut it in two pieces.  Many different\ndissection tilings use this number of pieces.  However it is possible\nto achieve a better average pieces/pentagon by allowing\nsome pentagons to be cut differently than others:\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dt25.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dt25.gif\" WIDTH=276 HEIGHT=353></A></CENTER><P>\n\nTwo pentagons may be partitioned into three pieces that tile,\ngiving an average of 1.5 pieces/polygon\n[original, Nov 1995].\n\n<P>\nNote that the average pieces/polygon of any pentagon dissection\ntiling must be bounded away from one.  To see this,\nlet d be the maximum density of a packing of pentagons on the plane;\nthen d<1.  Define a piecewise constant integer function\nf(x,y) by finding the piece covering (x,y) and counting\nhow many pieces the corresponding pentagon was cut into;\nthen the average pieces/polygon is just the limit of\n(integral_A f(x,y) / area(A)) over larger and larger areas.\nSince f(x,y) >= 1 everywhere,\nand f(x,y) >= 2 on a (1-d) fraction of A,\nthe average pieces/polygon is at least 2-d > 1.\nA similar argument applies to any input that does not itself\ntile the plane.\n\n<A NAME=\"8\">\n<H2>Octagons</H2></A>\n\nThe octagon appears to be very stubborn.\nIt is easy to find a two-piece dissection\n(just remove a rhomb from one corner, not shown.)\nIt is also possible to tile the plane with equal numbers\nof undissected octagons and squares.\nHowever I have been unable to find any\ndissection tiling of multiple octagons\nusing fewer than two pieces/polygon.\n\n<A NAME=\"9\">\n<H2>Heptagons and Nonagons</H2></A>\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dt9.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dt9.gif\" WIDTH=269 HEIGHT=328></A></CENTER><P>\n\nThis dissection tiling of the nonagon [original, Dec 1995], involving\nthree different strips with straight boundaries, must be aperiodic: the\nstrips have incommensurate periods, and one must alternate the strips in\nan aperiodic way to achieve the correct density of each type of piece.\nOne can use this idea to get tilings with pieces/polygon arbitrarily\nclose to 2.5.  The same ratios are achievable by periodic tilings, by\nchopping the narrower strips into long pieces of commensurate lengths,\nand performing slide dissection on the remaining rectangular \"scraps\" to\nmake them also commensurate.\n\n<P>One might think that an aperiodic tiling such as this one would be\nof no use in constructing dissections, but in fact a nine-piece\ndissection of the nonagon to a triangle (credited by\nLindgren to Irving Freese) is related to a similar aperiodic\ndissection tiling in which four trapezoids are cut from the nonagon to\nleave an equilateral triangle.  Robert Reid and Gavin Theobald further\nimproved this dissection to eight pieces using similar methods.\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dt7.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dt7.gif\" WIDTH=268 HEIGHT=357></A></CENTER><P>\n\nThe same method can also be used to find dissection\ntilings of the heptagon with pieces/polygon arbitrarily close to 2\n[original, Dec 1995].\n\n<A NAME=\"s6\">\n<H2>Six-point Stars</H2></A>\n\nThere are multiple ways of partitioning a six-point star into two pieces\nthat tile, for instance one can simply connect two opposite reflex\nvertices.  However as usual the average pieces/polygon can be reduced by\ndissecting several stars at once:\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dts6.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dts6.gif\" WIDTH=275 HEIGHT=341></A></CENTER><P>\n\nThree six-point stars can be dissected into five pieces\nfor an average of 1.666 pieces/polygon\n[original, Nov 1995].  The same pieces can be arranged in other ways\n(and other dissections are possible)\nbut this version has a pleasing amount of symmetry.\n\n<A NAME=\"s8\">\n<H2>Eight-point Stars</H2></A>\n\nThere are two different regular eight-point stars:\n8/2, in which the edges at the outer vertices point towards\nvertices two points away (also formed as unions of two squares)\nand 8/3, in which the edges at the outer vertices point towards\nvertices three points away.  More generally any star a/b\nis formed with a outer corners, each connected to the next by\nsegments pointing in the direction of the corner b points away.\n(This notation is not necessary for 5- and 6-point stars\nas only one value of b is possible for them.)\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dts82.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dts82.gif\" WIDTH=269 HEIGHT=346></A></CENTER><P>\n\nThis four-piece dissection tiling of the 8/2 star [original, Dec 1995]\nis easily generalized\nto tilings with average pieces/polygon arbitrarily close to 3.\nWith a little rearrangement it can be used to find a 7-piece dissection\nof 8/2 to a square, different from the one by Frederickson\nin his book with Lindgren.\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dts83.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dts83.gif\" WIDTH=267 HEIGHT=352></A></CENTER><P>\n\nOne 8/3 star can be dissected into two pieces that together tile\n[credited by Gr\u00fcnbaum and Shephard to D.

However\nit seems likely that an even better average can be obtained by\nsomehow mixing the 50:11 dissection above with the 2-pentagon\ndissection.  This should give an average of 155/132, which is just barely\nworse than 7/6, so perhaps there is a seven-piece dissection\nof the same six polygons.\n\n<A NAME=\"5s\">\n<H2>Pentagons and Stars</H2></A>\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dt45s5.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dt45s5.gif\" WIDTH=252 HEIGHT=342></A></CENTER><P>\n\nFour pentagons and one five-point star can be dissected into six pieces\nfor an average of 1.2 pieces/polygon [original, Nov 1995].\nThe star can also be divided into two congruent pieces, or \na pentagon can be cut and the star left intact.\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dtx53s.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dtx53s.gif\" WIDTH=262 HEIGHT=360></A></CENTER><P>\n\nEven better, ten pentagons and three stars can be dissected\ninto 15 pieces, for an average of 1.154 pieces/polygon [original, Dec 1995].\n\n<A NAME=\"8s\">\n<H2>Octagons and Stars</H2></A>\n\n<P><A HREF=\"dt17o6s.ps\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"dt17o6s.gif\" WIDTH=264 HEIGHT=330></A></CENTER><P>\n\nThere are many ways of combining octagons with 8/2 stars\nto form reasonably good tilings.  The best one I found\n(in terms of the average pieces/polygon 28/23 ~ 1.2174)\nis formed by dissecting 17 octagons\nand 6 stars into 28 pieces.  One of the octagons is partitioned into\nsquares and rhombs, and the other polygons are all left intact\n[original, Nov 1995].\n\n<P><A HREF=\"reid-orig.gif\">\n<CENTER><IMG BORDER=0 SRC=\"reid-8-82.gif\"></A></CENTER><P>\n\nBut this is not best!  14 octagons and 5 stars can be dissected into\nonly 23 pieces, giving a ratio of 1.2105.\n[Robert Reid, July 1998].\n\n<A NAME=\"3d\">\n<H2>Three Dimensional Dissection Tiling</H2></A>\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not true that any polyhedron has a dissection\ninto any other polyhedron of the same volume;\nfor instance the regular tetrahedron can not be dissected to\nan equal-volume cube.\nAs a consequence, it can also not be dissected\nto pieces that form a periodic tiling, because one could\nthen dissect a parallelohedral fundamental domain into cubes.\nHowever it is not clear to me whether a dissection tiling\nof the tetrahedron is totally ruled out by this argument, because an\naperiodic tiling (with the correct limiting density for each piece)\nmight still be possible.\n\n<P>\nIt is known that any two <I>zonohedra</I> of equal volumes can be\ndissected into each other.  Since some zonohedra tile (e.g. the\nparallelohedra and the rhombic dodecahedron), all zonohedra have\ndissection tilings.  However to my knowledge none have been explicitly\nconstructed.\n\n<A NAME=\"bib\"><H2>Bibliography and Related Pages</H2></A>\n\n<UL>\n<LI>The definitive reference for dissections is\nGreg Frederickson's new book on dissections,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gnf/book.html\">Dissections:\nPlane &amp; Fancy</A>.\nThis book discusses dissection tilings as well, but only for their\nuse in constructing dissections.\n\n<LI>An older reference covering much of the same material as\nGreg's new book is\n\"Recreational problems in geometric dissections & how to solve them\",\nHarry Lindgren & Greg Frederickson</A>, Dover 1972.\n\n<LI>A fairly comprehensive list of dissection tilings can be found in\nGr\u00fcnbaum and Shephard's\n\"Tilings and Patterns\", W.H.
