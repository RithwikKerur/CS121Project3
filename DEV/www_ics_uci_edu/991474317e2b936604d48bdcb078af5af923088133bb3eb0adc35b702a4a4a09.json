But what if the pieces are to be joined together into a connected \nfigure by hinges?  Can we make a device by joining polygons with hinges,\nso that its hinges can be turned in different ways to form any polyomino?\n\n<P>For tetrominoes (shapes made from four squares), we can again just cut \non the edges between squares. If we connect four squares by three \nappropriately placed hinges, we can form all five possible \ntetrominoes:\n\n<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><P>\n<IMG SRC=\"tetrominoes.gif\" WIDTH=426 HEIGHT=330 ALT=\"\">\n</DIV>\n\n<P>For higher-order polyominoes, the problem seems more difficult.\nFor instance, it does not seem to be possible to join five squares by \nhinges and form all twelve pentominoes.  However, we can still solve the \nhinged dissection problem by cutting the polyominoes into smaller pieces.\n\n<P>My original solution used the following \"ambivalent \nsquare\":\n\n<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><P>\n<IMG SRC=\"ambivalent-square.gif\" WIDTH=292 HEIGHT=276 ALT=\"\">\n</DIV>\n\n<P>The figure shows twelve hinged pieces arranged to form a square.  But \nbecause of the symmetric way in which the pieces are connected to each \nother, the same pieces can be folded into a square in a different way, in \nwhich the pieces at the top and bottom left corners of the figure have traded \nplaces.  A connected sequence\nof 4<I>k</I> \nambivalent squares forms a <I>universal dissection</I> that\ncan be folded into any <I>k</I>-omino.\n\n<P>Erich Friedman then found a much simpler universal dissection:\nJust take 2<I>k</I> isosceles right triangles,\nhinged one to the next at their acute angles.\nSo the straight pentomino could be made by 10 such triangles:\n<PRE>\n    +--+--+--+--+--+\n    |1/|\\2|3/|\\4|5/|\n    |/0|9\\|/8|7\\|/6|\n    +--+--+--+--+--+\n</PRE>\nYou can even join the ends to make a ring of triangles!\n\n<P>Erich and I now have a paper with Erik and Martin Demain,\nat the 1999 Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry:\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/pubs/p-hinged.html\">Hinged Dissections of Polyominos\nand Polyforms</A>.  In it, we describe this isosceles triangle construction,\nand related constructions for hinging polyiamonds, polyhexes, polyabolos,\nand similar shapes made from multiple copies of a single polygon.\n\n<P><HR><P>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"index.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
