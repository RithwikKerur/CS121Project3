However, we then have the case of intersections\nof every triples and now the inequality is in the opposite direction\nto what we desire in the proof. \n\nAnother approach to this problem is to look at the decomposition of\nthe union of the disks, by the Voronoi diagram induced by the centers\nof the disks.\n\nFirst, we need some definitions.\n\n{\\bf Def.} Given a collection of sets $\\cal{A}$, the nerve of $\\cal{A}$ \n(denoted by $N(\\cal{A})$) is defined to be \n$N(\\cal{A}) = \\{ X \\subseteq \\cal{A} | \\cap_{A_i \\in X} A_i \\neq \\emptyset \\}$ .\n\n{\\bf Def.}  A collection $\\cal{K}$ of sets is an abstract\nsimplicial  complex if  $\\sigma \\in \\cal{K}$ and $\\tau \\subset \\sigma$\nimplies $\\tau \\in \\cal{K} $.\n\nGiven a set of points in the plane, we can define the $\\cal{A}$ to be\nthe collection of the Voronoi cells. The nerve of $\\cal{A}$, then\nconsists of singletons, pairs, and triples of these cells. \nIf we join pairs of points, whose corresponding pair of \nVoronoi cells occur in the nerve, by line segments we get the dual of the\nVoronoi diagram, also called the Delaunay triangulation. The \ntriangles in the Delaunay triangulation, corresponds to the\ntriples of Voronoi cells occurring in the  nerve. Thus the \nDelaunay triangulation corresponds to a geometric realization of\nthe nerve. The geometric realization in this case is the collection\nof various dimensional simplices whose vertices occur as sets in the nerve.\n\nWe can also give another definition of the Delaunay triangulation\nwhich depend only on the local properties of the points. A simplex\nis in the Delaunay triangulation if and only if the interior of\nthe $d$-sphere passing through the $(d+1)$ vertices of the simplex\ndoes not contain any of the other points.\n\n{\\bf Def.} A collection $\\cal{K}$ of simplices is a simplicial\ncomplex if \n\ni)$ \\sigma \\in \\cal{K} $ and $\\tau$ is a face of $\\sigma$  imply that $\n\\tau \\in \\cal{K}$ and,\n\nii) $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\in \\cal{K}$ , implies that $ \\sigma_1 \\cap \\sigma_2 =\n\\emptyset$ , or $\\sigma_1 \\cap \\sigma_2$ is a face of both $\\sigma_1$\nand $\\sigma_2$.\n\n\n{\\bf Def.} A $k$-simplex in $R^d$ , $0 \\leq k \\leq d$, is the\nconvex hull of $k+1$ affinely independent points in $R^d$.\n\nNote that, any subset of $l+1 \\leq k+1$  points of a simplex define\nan $l$-simplex which is called an $l$-face of the $k$-simplex.\n\nWe can observe that in the plane, any triangulation of a polygon has\nthe same number of triangles. The situation is not the same in other\ndimensions. As an example, consider the octahedron in dimension three:\nif we have a regular octahedron, it can be decomposed in four\ntetrahedra, but if we twist the vertices in such a way that two of\nde diagonals do not cut each other, then we obtain five tetrahedra.\nQuestion: what happens if we twist the tetrahedron in such a way that \nthe three diagonals do not cross each other?\n\nWe next give the definition of an important transformation.\n\n{\\bf Def.} The inversion with center $z$ is a map,\n\\[ ^o: R^d-\\{z\\} \\rightarrow R^d-\\{z\\}  \\]\n\\[   x \\rightarrow x^o = \\frac{x}{|x|^2}  \\]\n\nThe following properties of the inversion map are easy to prove.\n\ni) $(x^o)^o=x$\n\nii) If $S$ is a sphere such that $ z\\not \\in S$ then $S^o$ is a\nsphere.\n\niii) If $z\\in S$ then $S^o$ is a hyperplane.\n\n{\\bf Def.}\nLet $\\pi$ be a d-sphere and let $z\\in \\pi$. The stereographic\nprojection is the map from $\\pi$ to $\\pi^o$ that sends the point $x\\in\n\\pi$   to $x^o$.\n\nClaim: \nIf $S$ is a  $(d-1)$-sphere in $\\pi$ then $S^o$ is a $(d-1)$-sphere in\n$\\pi^o$ (or a $(d-1)$-plane if $z \\in S$).\n\nProof: \nLet $S_1$ the sphere passing through $S^o$ and $z$ and let $S_1^o$ its\ninversion.\nThen $S_1^o$ is a plane which cuts $\\pi$ in $S$. This proves the\nclaim.\n\nLet $S$ be a set of points in $R^d$ and let $S^o$ be its image via\ninversion. If $P$ is the convex hull of the set $S^o$ and $\\cal{K}$ is the\nstereographic projection of the boundary complex of $P$ then it can be\nproved that $\\cal{K}$ is the Delaunay triangulation of the set $S$.\n\n\\end{document}\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
