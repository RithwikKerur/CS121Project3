TWIST provides a forum for\ndiscussion and enables quick dissemination of current ideas\nwithin a well-targeted audience. The goals of the workshop series are\ndeveloping a better understanding among the different\ncommunities of interest, improved definition of requirements for scaling\nto the Internet, better appreciation of the application\ndomains that require or benefit from this approach, and suggestions for\nfruitful research directions.\n<p>\nThese workshops are held annually in the summer months at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine. \n<p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> \n<a href=\"twist/twist99\">\nThe Workshop on Internet-scale Software Technologies (TWIST 99)</a>,  \n     August 19-20, 1999<br>\n     <p>\n<li> \n<a href=\"twist/wisen98\">The Workshop on Internet-Scale Event Notification,\n     (WISEN)</a>, July 13-14, 1998\n     <br>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n<p>\n\n<img src=\"images/blueball.gif\"> <font size=+1><b>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/research_partnerships.html\">\nResearch Partnerships</a></b></font size><br>\n\nResearch partnerships are relationships typically between an individual\ncompany and an individual faculty member, focused around a specific project \nor topic. The focus is often on collaboration to solve problems of mutual \ninterest. In some cases companies financially sponsor a specific research \nproject which is conducted at UCI. In some cases the focus is on transitioning \ntechnology to the company.  Other projects may focus on UCI usage of \ncorporate technology. Still others are directed at site visits for information \nexchange, consulting, or arranging summer internships for students. \n\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n<HR>\n<h2> Schedule of Events, Flyers, Mailing Lists </h2>\n\nThe IRUS \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/schedule.html\">schedule of events</A>\nincludes flyers for SPIN, BART, symposia, and other\nspecial events. \n<p>\nFlyers are also available directly via the IRUS\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/mailing_lists.html\">\nelectronic and postal mailing lists.</A>\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">Back to the IRUS home page</A>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
