a good\r\n    programmer knows where to put white space when writing code. \r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Identifiers -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Identifiers\"><hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Identifiers</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  The first category of token is an <b>Identifier</b>.\r\n  Identifiers are used by programmers to name things in Java: things such as\r\n    variables, methods, fields, classes, interfaces, exceptions, packages, etc.\r\n  The rules for recognizing/forming legal identifiers can be easily stated in\r\n    EBNF.\r\n  <p>\r\n  <i>id-start</i> &nbsp &nbsp<= <i>alphabetic</i> | $ | _<br> \r\n  <i>identifier</i> <= <i>id-start</i>{<i>id-start</i> | <i>numeric</i> }<br> \r\n  <p>\r\n  Although identifiers can start with and contain the <b>$</b> character,\r\n    we should never include a <b>$</b> in identifiers that we write;\r\n    such identifiers are reserved for use by the compiler, when it needs to\r\n    name a special symbol that will not conflict with the names we write.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Semantically, all characters in an identifier are significant, including the\r\n    case (upper/lower) of the alphabetic characters.\r\n  For example, the identifier <b>Count</b> and <b>count</b> denote different\r\n    names in Java;

technically, it treats them as white space\r\n    when it is forming tokens.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Comments help us capture aspects of our programs that cannot be expressed as\r\n     Java code.\r\n  Things like goals, specification, design structures, time/space tradeoffs,\r\n    historical information, advice for using/modifying this code, etc.\r\n  Programmers intensely study their own code (or the code of others) when\r\n     maintaining it  (testing, debugging or modifying it).\r\n  Good comments in code make all these tasks much easier.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Java includes two style for comments.\r\n  <ul>\r\n     <li>Line-Oriented: begins with <b>//</b> and continues until the end of\r\n           the line.\r\n     <li>Block-Oriented: begins with <b>/*</b> and continues (possibly over\r\n           many lines) until <b>*/</b> is reached. \r\n     <ul>\r\n       <li>So, we can use block-oriented comments to create multiple comments\r\n           within a line<br>\r\n           <b>&nbsp &nbsp display(/*Value*/ x, /*on device*/ d);</b><br>\r\n           In contrast, once a line-oriented comment starts, everything \r\n             afterward on its line is included in the comment.\r\n       <li>We can also use block-oriented comments to span multiple lines<br>\r\n           <b>/*<br>\r\n              &nbsp &nbsp This is a multi-line comment.<br>\r\n              &nbsp &nbsp No matter home many lines<br>\r\n              &nbsp &nbsp it includes, only one pair<br>\r\n              &nbsp &nbsp of delimiters are needed.<br>\r\n              */</b><br>\r\n           In contrast, a line-oriented comment stops at the end of the line\r\n             it starts on.\r\n     </ul>\r\n   </ul>     \r\n   Technically, both kinds of comments are treated as white space, so writing\r\n     <b>X/*comment*/Y</b> has the same meaning in Java as writing the tokens\r\n     <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b>, not the single token <b>XY</b>.\r\n   <p>\r\n   Typically Java comments are line-oriented; we will save block-oriented\r\n      comments for a special debugging purpose (discussed later).\r\n   <p>\r\n   The EBNF rule for comments is more complicated than insightful, so we will\r\n     not study here.\r\n   This happens once in a while.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Programs -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Programs\"><hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Program are a Sequence of Tokens built from Characters</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  The first phase, a Java compiler tokenizes a program by scanning its\r\n    characters left to right, top to bottom (there is a hidden end-of-line\r\n    character at the end of each line;

they did not\r\n    represent an ongoing game.\r\n  In this modified experiment, the chess experts did only marginally better\r\n    than the novices.\r\n  DeGroot's conclusion was that chess experts saw the board differently than\r\n    novices: they saw not only pieces, but attacking and defending structures,\r\n    board control, etc.\r\n  <p>\r\n  In this class, I am trying to teach you how to see programs as a programmer\r\n    sees them: not as a sequence of characters, but at a higher structural\r\n    level.\r\n  Tokens is where we start this process.\r\n  For another example on what the mind sees when it reads, look at the\r\n    following <a href=\"understanding.docx\">document</a>.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Problem Set -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ProblemSet\"><hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Problem Set</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  To ensure that you understand all the material in this lecture, please solve\r\n    the the announced problems after you read the lecture.\r\n  <p>\r\n  If you get stumped on any problem, go back and read the relevant part of the\r\n     lecture.\r\n  If you still have questions, please get help from the Instructor, a CA, a Tutor,\r\n    or any other student.\r\n  <ol>\r\n    <li>Classify each of the following as a legal or illegal identifier.\r\n        If it is illegal, propose a legal identifier that can take its place\r\n        (a homophone or homoglyph)\r\n    <table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"all\" width =\"100%\">\r\n    <tbody > \r\n    <tr> <td><b>packAge</b></td>  <td><b>x12</b></td>  <td><b>2Lips</b></td>\r\n    <tr> <td><b>xOrY</b></td>      <td><b>sum of squares</b></td>  <td><b>%Raise</b></td>\r\n    <tr> <td><b>termInAte</b></td>  <td><b>u235</b></td>  <td><b>$Bill</b></td>\r\n    <tr> <td><b>x_1</b></td>  <td><b>x&Y</b></td>  <td><b>1derBoys</b></td>\r\n    </table>\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n    <li> What tokens does Java build from the characters <b>ab=c+++d==e</b>.\r\n         Be sure that you know your <a href=\"#Operators\">Operators</a>.\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n    <li>Classify each of the following numeric literals as <b>int</b>, or <b>double</b>, or\r\n       illegal (neither);
