Once you settle\non a client and a task for this study, you will investigate that area, reporting\nyour findings and recommending actions to your client.  The point of casting\nthis as a consulting job is to help you focus on a particular problem with\nreal-world requirements and constraints, as opposed to a merely hypothetical\nresearch exercise.\n<BR>\n<B>Examples of the range of possible subjects:</B>  For example, you might\nbe asked how to improve computerized course enrollment (in which case your\nclient would be the Registrar), or increase computer access for students\non campus (the Chancellor), or automatically score intercollegiate fencing\nmatches (the fencing team or league).  Another possibility is preventing\nsoftware piracy (with a software publisher as a client) or hacking (a legislator\nor computer center manager).  Yet another is how to use computers for video\nspecial effects or music scoring (for a producer).\n<BR>\n<B>Purpose and content:</B>  This shouldn&#39;t be a conventional term paper,\nrestating information we could find in books.  The emphasis of your paper\nshould be on analyzing the difficulties of the particular situation you\nselect and investigating practical solutions.  It is a chance for you to\naddress first-hand some of the issues and problems in an area that you care\nabout, applying computing knowledge and techniques.\n<BR>\nComplete, definite, final, usable results are not the most important part\nof this project.  We often learn as much from our failures as our successes.\n What is important is the process of grappling with the problem, trying\nto understand it, and describing that process to us.  This is why we ask\nyou to take on a real problem rather than an imaginary one.  With a real\nproblem, you have to fit the solution to reality; with an imaginary one,\nyou could just change the facts for your convenience.\n<BR>\n<B>Organization:</B>  Your final project should include the following:\n<BR>\n* A description of your problem.  (If you follow the consultant-client model\nexplicitly, you should say who your client is, what is your client&#39;s\ncurrent situation, what your client needs to know or wants to do, and what\nyour client&#39;s special circumstances or requirements are.)\n<BR>\n* Your solution process and whatever results you obtained.  (This makes\nup the main part of your project.)\n<BR>\n* Your sources of information, backing up all the facts and figures you\nused.  This need <I>not</I> be gathered all together at the end as a formal\nbibliography--it is better to mention the name of the source at the point\nwhere you use it in the body of the paper.\n<BR>\n<B>Presentation:</B>  You should prepare a half-hour presentation of your\nproject, to be delivered to the class during the last three weeks of the\nquarter.  Please let us know in advance any special audio/visual equipment\nyou will need; we can get almost anything if we have enough lead time.\n<BR>\n<B>Format:</B>  You should prepare the paper using a computer word processor.\n It should be around five to seven concisely written pages.  That doesn&#39;t\nsound like a big deal, but your major effort should go into solving the\nproblem rather than into writing it up.  Think of this as 40 or 50 pages\nof work, concisely summarized into five to seven pages of writing.\n<BR>\nIntersperse whatever appropriate illustrations you can--additional figures\ndo not count as additional pages.  Headings and subheadings are useful,\nas is a table of contents or outline at the start of the paper.  And please,\nplease, no padded sentences like, &quot;The subject matter and the nature\nof the problem which I will attempt to deal with and for which I have carried\nout a solution process as a field study term paper for Honors Collegium\n49 this quarter is the question regarding the determination of whether or\nnot ...&quot;  Every word should count!\n<BR>\n<B>Grading:</B>  We use the following grading criteria, in approximate order\nof importance:\n<BR>\n* Comprehensiveness and thoroughness -- Consider carefully all the alternatives\navailable, all the aspects and difficulties of your topic.\n<BR>\n* Clarity of writing and presentation -- If we can&#39;t understand it,\nwe can&#39;t grade it, and we want it to be <I>very</I> easy to follow.\n<BR>\n* Sources of information -- Describe where the information comes from; back\nup your facts; don&#39;t just make assertions (especially technical ones)\noff the cuff.\n<BR>\n* Form -- Lousy grammar and page after page of monotonous text not broken\nup by illustrations or headings are bad; we appreciate attractively presented\nand appropriate diagrams, charts, and drawings.\n<BR>\n<B>Hints:</B>  The best&#160;projects almost always turn out to be the ones\nwhere the author has a strong interest or commitment to the topic.  Since\nwe allow you a great deal of latitude in choosing your topic, there is no\nreason you shouldn&#39;t pick something you find exciting.  Don&#39;t fall\ninto the successful-student trap of choosing a &quot;safe&quot; topic that\nyou can already see the complete solution to; go for the topic you really\n<I>want</I> to tackle, and your grade won&#39;t suffer.  If you have trouble\nselecting a topic, come talk to us.\n<BR>\nTry to choose an unconventional topic.  We see many projects on how to choose\na microcomputer for some business or personal task; some of these are excellently\ndone, but if you do something different, you&#39;ll stand out from the crowd.\n<BR>\nSpend most of your time solving your problem and describing how you did\nit.  Don&#39;t go overboard describing background information (like how\ncomputers work or unnecessarily involved details about your project or client).\n<BR>\nLikewise, don&#39;t go overboard with flashy illustrations or visuals unless\nthey really help get your point across.\n<BR>\nAnd finally, just to reiterate, you should choose a real-world topic.  The\nmore real-world details and constraints you have, the more interesting and\nuseful your solution will be.  If your project were purely hypothetical,\nyour field study becomes a purely academic term paper, which is deadly dull.</FONT></P>\n<BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
