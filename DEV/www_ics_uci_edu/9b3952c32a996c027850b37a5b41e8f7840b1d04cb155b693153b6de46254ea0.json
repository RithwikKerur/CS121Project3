After thinking over the difficulty of the phases, looking at the score distribution, and considering the granularity of the grading system (e.g., one point more could raise your letter grade a notch), I decided to drop the grade cut offs by 10 points from those given in the Course Reference.</p>\r\r<p>The scores on the course spreadsheet are in order of the\rlast four digits of the student ID number (the first column). After your ID  comes the code score and the demonstration score for each of the graded FabFlix's phases. Next is your point total for the code and that total as a percentage; then comes your letter grade. </p>\r\r<p>Do check over your scores; if you find any which are\rincorrect <i>and that would change your final grade in the course</i> contact me; since my schedule\rduring the summer tends to be erratic, it \u2019s probably best to send me e-mail\rabout the problem.</p>\r\r<p>Enjoy the summer!</p>\r<p>Norman Jacobson</p>\r\r\r</body>\r</html>\r", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
