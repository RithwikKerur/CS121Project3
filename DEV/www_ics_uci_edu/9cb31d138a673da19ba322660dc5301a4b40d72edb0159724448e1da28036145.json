Why can't we just look at the top edge \n|and the smallest square there, go across, then carry on as before? ...\n|What's specially different between 2D and 3D here?\n\nIn this posting, by an Xd X I will mean an X partitioned into a finite\nnumber of Xs of unequal sizes.\n\nThe proof is as follows: Look at the bottom of the cubed cube; you will\nsee a squared square.  *The smallest square, S, in this squared square cannot \nbe on the boundary.* Therefore, the cube with S for a face is surrounded by \nfour larger cubes, so its opposite face abuts another squared square.  We\ncan now look at the smallest square in this squared square.  It is then\nthe face of some cube surrounded by four larger cubes, which we can look\nat the opposite face of, and so on: since this process can be continued \nindefinitely, there can be no cubed cube.\n\nThe difference between 2D and 3D is in the starred statement.  The smallest\nline in a segmented segment can be on the boundary, but the smallest square in \na squared square cannot be.\n-- \nDavid Moews                                <A HREF=\"mailto:dmoews@xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu\">dmoews@xraysgi.ims.uconn.edu</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
