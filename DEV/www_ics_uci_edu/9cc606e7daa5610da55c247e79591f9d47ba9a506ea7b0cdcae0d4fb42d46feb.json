Christopher writes:\n\n] The doctrine of the Mormons is supposed to have been given to them by\n] the angel Moroni -- there is a golden statue of him on top of the\n] Mormon temple in Salt Lake City.  I guess \"Mormon\" and \"Moroni\" are\n] lexically close...  I wouldn't care to have a name like that if I were\n] an angel though.\n\nUnfortunately, history has that bit wrong. The doctrine was given by\nthe angel Voronoi, and concerned methods of drawing hyperplanes\nequidistant from pairs of points in general location. Joseph Smith,\nunfortunately, had just woken up and was too groggy to understand the\nname correctly, besides having flunked CG. The angels Preparata and\nShamos were due for a visit too, but gave up after that episode.\n\n- Steve \"Posse Comitatus, here I come\" <A HREF=\"mailto:masticol@athos.rutgers.edu\">masticol@athos.rutgers.edu</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
