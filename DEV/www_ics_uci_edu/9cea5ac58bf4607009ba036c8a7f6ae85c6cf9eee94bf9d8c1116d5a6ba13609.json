And I\nmean \"discuss\" literally--I will explain some ideas that I hope you\nwill find interesting (and maybe even a little elegant), but I am\nalso\nhoping for feedback from the audience to help me with some unsolved\nproblems.\n\n<p>\nPlease arrive a few minutes early, as their are a limited number of\n3D glasses that will be passed out so as to appreciate this talk.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
