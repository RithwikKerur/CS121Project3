Each\r\none of the edges can be seen as a transition between different states of the problem where each state depends on\r\nthe previous and the decision taken.\r\nThere\u2019s a subset of these problems where we can identify subproblems which are independent from each other, in\r\nother words, the solutions of one don\u2019t depend on the other. Sometimes we can also identify equivalent subproblems\r\nthat can be solved interchangeably. Consequently, it\u2019s interesting to have a graph than can model these relations\r\nand, later, algorithms that exploit them to solve the given problems. The models that capture these independencies\r\nare called AND/OR trees (or graphs depending on their connectivity) and yield solutions in the form of a sub-tree.\r\nAn example modeled with a common search tree (which corresponds to an OR tree) has inherently larger size than\r\nan AND/OR tree since the later as it takes into account the subproblems\u2019 independency. Intuitively we can think\r\nthat an OR tree solves subproblems in a chain-like manner while AND/OR trees branches them out yielding a tree\r\nwith a smaller height.\r\nAs it\u2019ll be seen later, these graphs can be used to model inference problems (graphical models, in general) and\r\nexact and approximated algorithms have been implemented used to obtain the answers compute the answers to\r\nthe most common queries. The modeling, solution and complexity of finding solutions to these problems are the\r\nsubject of study of the present work. Orderings of variables and pseudo-trees, the underlying structures needed to\r\nconstruct the problem\u2019s space, will be studied as well due to their impact in the complexity of said algorithms. The\r\nnew contributions of this work are the analysis of the trade-offs between the width and height of the pseudo-trees\r\nand the implementation of AND/OR Beam Search and Anytime AND/OR Beam Search as an attempt to tackle\r\nthe weaknesses of some of the state-of-the-art algorithms.\r\n\t  </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r243.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><div id=\"footer\"><centeR>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu\">School of Information and Computer Science</A>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu\">University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3435</a>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter\">Dr. Rina Dechter</A>\n\r\n<A HREF=\"mailto:dechter_at_ics.uci.edu\">dechter at ics.uci.edu</A>\r\n\n</center></div><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
