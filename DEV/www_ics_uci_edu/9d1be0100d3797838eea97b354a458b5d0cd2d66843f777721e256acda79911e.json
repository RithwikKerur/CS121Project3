If you\nhaven't already found a solution, here is mine, firstly inductively,\nthen non-inductively.\n\nSuppose you have, for an existing polygonal region P, a function\nf giving the height at each point, being equal to 0 on dP, the\nboundary of P and continuous and affine on the polygonal\nsubregions in question.  Add another vertex v, making a polygon Q.\n\nDefine g on Q to be that whose graph is a pyramid with\nbase Q and apex v.\n[e.g. if x in Q\\{V}, there is a unique lambda in [0,1] and\ny in (dP intersect dQ) such that x=(lambda)v+(1-lambda)y.\nDefine g(x)=lambda.]\nThen g+f is as required except on Q\\P.\n\nBut this is easy to fix, as the diagonals passing through\nQ\\P divide it into triangles with a vertex at v.\n[e.g. define h to have graph equal to the top surface of\nthe convex hull of graph( (g+f)|P ) union Q x {0} ,\nOR define it as some lambda in a convex combination, as above]\n\nCome to think of it, this construction can be done\nin closed form.  Read a_b as a-subscript-b here:\n\nLet P be the polygon and V the finite vertex set.\nFor each v in V, define g_v on P by\n  g_v(x) = min{ lambda : exists y in P\n                        such that x=lambda v + (1-lambda) y }\nand define g = ( sum_v g_v ) - 1 .\n\nCheers, Andrew\n\n[ Dr Andrew Kepert              e-mail: <A HREF=\"mailto:andrew@frey.newcastle.edu.au\">andrew@frey.newcastle.edu.au</A> ]\n[                               <A HREF=\"http://frey.newcastle.edu.au/~andrew\">http://frey.newcastle.edu.au/~andrew</A> ]\n[ Central Coast Campus, Univ. of Newc., Ourimbah NSW 2258, AUSTRALIA ]\n[                           Phone: 02 4348 4116    Fax: 02 4348 4145 ]\n[ Mathematics, University of Newcastle, Callaghan NSW 2308 AUSTRALIA ]\n[                           Phone: 02 4921 5190    Fax: 02 4921 5548 ]\n</PRE>\n<IMG SRC=\"kepert-gv.gif\" WIDTH=395 HEIGHT=348 ALT=\"\">\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
