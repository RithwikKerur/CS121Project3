Read over the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i42/wildride/problem_description_files/index.html\">problem description</A> for the amusement park simulator, noting (i) that it's not essential that you retain every detail and (ii) that your task won't be to build this from scratch, but to enhance it in various ways (though for that, you'll need to become familiar with the existing code that we will supply).</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><strong>(b)</strong> Using tkinter, write a GUI for a window that could be used to set some initial values in the dice-playing program from Lab A. As we discussed in class, your window should have three labeled text fields: one for the player's stake (the amount of money the player starts with), one for computer's stake, and one for number of test rolls. You should also have three buttons at the bottom: Cancel, Clear, and Submit or OK. When the user clicks Submit/OK, the entered values should be checked (empty values shouldn't be accepted) and transmitted back to the calling program.</FONT></P>\n<P><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">To start out, create one label and one text entry field; then create a Submit button that transmits the entered text back to the calling program</font> (which can just print it out). This much should be pretty easy to do by adapting the code we developed in class. Continue to work on the rest of this as time permits, but don't let it interfere with the rest of this homework or the current lab. Only if you're very ambitious or have a lot of spare time should you actually install your GUI in a copy of your Lab A program.</P>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: medium; \"><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\"><strong>(c)</strong><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0</span>In the California Lottery game SuperLotto, a player would pay $1.00 to pick six different numbers (between 1 and 51) for the next draw. (We're describing the original SuperLotto game, not the current SuperLotto Plus with a separate \"Mega\" number; the probabilities for SuperLotto Plus are a little more complicated.) Every Wednesday and Saturday, the Lottery draws six numbers. If the player's six numbers match the Lottery's six numbers, the player wins the multi-million-dollar jackpot (or splits it with any other players who also picked the same six winning numbers). If nobody matches the six winning numbers, the jackpot \"rolls over\" to the next draw; that is, the jackpot amount for the draw with no winners is added to the jackpot for the next draw. If many draws go by with no winners, the jackpot can get very large; it has been over $100,000,000.</font></p>\n<p style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: medium; \"><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Which of the following statements are supported by the principles of probability?

This may be the greatest piece of computer science pedagogical cinematography every made (but even so, it's about sorting algorithms, so don't be expecting <em>Harry Potter </em>or <em>Star Wars</em>). Here are a few points that will enhance your enjoyment and understanding of this video:</font></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We don't expect you to learn the specific sorting algorithms described in the video.  (You may have the opportunity to learn them in a subsequent course.)</li>\n<li>We might ask you about the video's main concepts. \n</li>\n<li>Don't fall asleep or let your attention wane during the boring parts\u2014that's when the funniest lines come.\n</li>\n<li>The music is goofy in places; deal with it. The graphics are fuzzy (it's 1980 technology); deal with that, too.\n</li>\n<li>The best part of the video comes <em>after</em> the credits, so don't quit when the credits come up.

Along with\nall the other statistics, it should print out the most frequently occurring\ntoken in its input file, along with the number of times that token occurred.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Which of Python's built-in data structures is right for keeping track of the tokens and the frequency of each? This is something everyone should be able to answer; talk with your classmates to make sure you all agree. Then implement it: Once you&#39;ve processed the text and counted the frequencies, you can\ngo through your structure to find the highest value and the associated\ntoken.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">[You may feel uncomfortable returning to a\n    program you wrote a few weeks ago and then making modifications to it.\n    Parts of it may no longer seem familiar to you, or you may not remember\n    why you made the decisions you did when you were working on it.  It's\n    important to realize that, in a real-world software development context,\n    you might often be in a position where you have to work on something that\n    you haven't seen in a while, or where you have to work on something that\n    you didn't even build in the first place.  Unlike undergraduate homework\n    assignments, which you can often just \"submit and forget,\" real-world\n    projects tend to have a long lifespan.  If you're finding it difficult\n    to get yourself back into the swing of working on this assignment, take the\n    opportunity to consider what you might have done differently four weeks ago\n    to make this experience better.  Are there design choices you might have\n    made differently?  Documentation that you might have written?  Names\nthat you might have chosen differently?</FONT>]</P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(b)</B>  But what if\nyou want the 10 most frequent tokens?  You need to sort the frequency list.\nBut since your frequency list is a Python dictionary [oops\u2014gave it away!], which is stored as a hash table, you can't sort it in place. So you need to turn it into a list of key-value pairs (e.g., with <code>L = list(d.items())</code>), swap the pairs so the value comes first (either <code>N = []; for i in L: N.append( (i[1],i[0]) )</code> or with a list comprehension, <code>N = [ (v,k) for (k,v) in L]</code>), sort on the value (<code>S = sorted(N, reverse=True)</code>), and then print the first 10.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(c)</B>  Now, let&#39;s keep track of actual\n    words, not just tokens.  Modify your Stats program so that it continues\n    to gather all the statistics about tokens as before, but also gathers a\nparallel set of statistics about &quot;real words.&quot;</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">What&#39;s a &quot;real&quot; word?  At </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\" SIZE=2><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/wordlist.txt\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/wordlist.txt</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">\nis a file of about 380,000 words.  For our purposes, a word is real if it&#39;s\non this list.  (We could think about ways of managing the list, allowing\nthe user to add new words and delete questionable ones, but let&#39;s just\nthink about it and not do it for now.)  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Implementation hints and advice (think before\nreading; that&#39;s how you learn):  You&#39;ll need to read in the wordlist\nand store it; then as you process each token\nin the input text file, you&#39;ll look it up on the wordlist to determine\nwhether to include it in the real-word statistics.  There is a fine opportunity\nfor code reuse here:  If you have a class for a collection of tokens, with\nmethods that produce various statistics, you can create one instance of\nthe class for all the tokens in the input and a second instance that will\ncontain just the real words.</FONT></P>\n<P>&nbsp;</P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Written by David G.
