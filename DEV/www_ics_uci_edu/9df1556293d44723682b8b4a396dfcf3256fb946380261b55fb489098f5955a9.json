Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and two vertices\n$s,t \\in V$, a set of vertices $T \\subseteq V$ is a tracking set for $G$\n(with respect to paths from $s$ to $t$), if one can distinguish between\nany two paths from $s$ to $t$ by the order in which the vertices of $T$\nappear (or do not appear) in them. We prove that the problem of finding\na minimum-cardinality tracking set with respect to shortest paths from\n$s$ to $t$ is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard and even $\\mathsf{APX}$-hard. On the\nother hand, for the common case where $G$ is planar, we present a\n$2$-approximation algorithm for this problem. We also consider the\nfollowing related problem: Given a graph $G$, two vertices $s$ and $t$,\nand a set of forbidden vertices $V_F \\subseteq V\\setminus\\{s,t\\}$, find a\nminimum-cardinality set of trackers $V^* \\subset V$, such that a\nshortest path $P$ from $s$ to $t$ passes through a forbidden vertex if\nand only if it passes through a vertex of $V^\u00e2\u02c6\u2014$. We present a\npolynomial-time (exact) algorithm for this problem.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57586-5_7\">a\npaper by Banik, Katz, Packer, and Simakov at CIAC 2017</a>.)</p>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
