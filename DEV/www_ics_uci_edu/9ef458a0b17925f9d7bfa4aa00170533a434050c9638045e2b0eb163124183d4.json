Now saw through the\n&gt; dodecahedron horizontal at the two interior levels. The dodecahedron\n&gt; is sawn into three pieces, of which the top and bottom piece are\n&gt; congruent. How can one show that the three pieces each have the same\n&gt; volume without doing a long and horrible integration?\n&gt; \n&gt; Is this a special case of some more general theorem?\n\nLet the dodecahedron have height h and face area A. One can\ndecompose it into 12 pentagonal pyramids of base area A and\nheight h/2. Then the volume of the dodecahedron is\n12((h/2)A/3) = 2Ah. It suffices to show that the bottom piece\nhas volume 2Ah/3. This piece is a frustum of a pentgonal pyramid.\nIts top face has area tau^2 A where tau =(1+sqrt(5))/2.\n(This comes from tau being the ratio of diagonal to side of a\nregular pentagon.) Let h_1 and h_2 be the heights of the bottom\nand central pieces. Then 2h_1 + h_2 = h. We need to determine h_1.\nBut the ratio of (h_1 + h_2) to h_1 is the same as the ratio of the\ndistance of the vertices A_1 and A_2 from the side A_3 A_4 in the\nregular pentagon A_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5, and is seen to be tau.\nThen we find h_1 = tau^{-2}h and h_2 = tau^{-3}h. (Naturally\neverything is in golden ratio). We can express the frustum in\nquestion as the \"difference\" of two pentagonal pyramids. Let d be\nthe height of the smaller of these, so that d + h_1 is the height\nof the larger. Then the ratio of d + h_1 to d is the same as the\nratio of the sidelengths of the bases of the pyramids, i.e., it is\ntau. Thus d = tau^{-1}h and d + h_1 = h. Thus the large pyramid\nhas volume (tau^2 A)h/3 and the small one has volume A tau^{-1}h/3.\nThus the frustum has volume (tau^2-tau^{-1})Ah/3 = 2Ah/3.\n\nNot an integration in sight! I'm sure Euclid could have come up\nwith such an argument.\n\n-- \nRobin Chapman\t\t\t \t\"256 256 256.\nDepartment of Mathematics\t\t O hel, ol rite; 256; whot's\nUniversity of Exeter, EX4 4QE, UK\t 12 tyms 256?
