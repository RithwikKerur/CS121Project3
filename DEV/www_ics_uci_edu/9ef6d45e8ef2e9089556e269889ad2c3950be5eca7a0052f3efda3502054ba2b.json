By making the audio and video communications programmable in the browser language, it is expected to have a profound impact on the way we communicate with each other. WebRTC will enable exciting new experiences on computing devices in individual communications, group meetings, e-commerce, customer support, remote collaborations, media, and online education among others.  WebRTC has the potential of transforming the web to the main real-time interaction medium.\n<br>\n<br>\nKudos to the UC Irvine research team of Prof. Nicolau and Prof. Veidenbaum for developing WebRTCBench, a ground breaking benchmarking suite for quantitative measurement of the system characteristics of fundamental operations of WebRTC. With the rapidly increasing importance of WebRTC in computing and communication industries, I have growing hope that WebRTCBench will play a major role in helping optimize WebRTC implementations and shape this exceptionally important emerging technology.\"\n<br>\n<br>\nDr. Mohammad Reza Haghighat\n<br>\nSenior Principal Engineer and leader of Intel HTML5 technical strategy\n</dir>\n</dir>\n<dir>\n<h3><a href=\"./projects/CompilerML.html\"> Compiler and performance optimization using similarity analysis </a> </h3>\n</dir>\n<dir>\n<h3><a href=\"./projects/OOOcommit.html\"> Improving single core performance via compiler-assisted out-of-order commit </a> </h3>\n</dir>\n<dir>\n<h3><a href=\"./projects/oldprojects.html\"> Some prior projects </a> </h3>\n</dir>\n<br>\n<h2><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~alexv/pubs.html\"> Publications </a> </h2>\n<br>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
