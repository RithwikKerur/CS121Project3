Then, after it's over, go\naround the audience and ask each person to say at least one thing they\nliked about the talk, and at least one thing that could be changed to\nmake the talk better.  You'll get lots of great feedback this way.\n\nStructure: You want to have an Introduction where you tell them what\nyou're going to tell them, then 2 to 4 major sections, then a Summary\nwhere you tell them what you told them.  The Intro should state right\nup front what it is about the talk that they'll find interesting ---\ni.e., it should immediately answer the question, \"Why should I stay\nawake and listen to her when I could be happier daydreaming instead?\"\nThe major sections should have a logical development.  The Summary\nshould restate why they were interested and point out that you\nsatisfied that interest.\n\nThe Simple Story: Organize your talk into sections by deciding what\nthe \"Simple Story\" is --- the 2 or 3 sentence short summary.  A great\nexample is Caesar's \"Simple Story\" of his conquest in Asia Minor ---\n\"Veni, vidi, vici\", or \"I came, I saw, I conquered.\"  This simple\nstory summarizes a major military campaign in the ancient world.  It\nwould be used to organize a talk into an Intro, 3 major sections, and\na Summary.  The first major section, \"I came,\" would tell about the\npreparations and the journey.  The second, \"I saw,\" would describe the\nsituation he found when he arrived.  Then the third, \"I conquered,\"\nwould describe the campaign itself.\n\nCreative Repetition: The listener can't go back and re-read, so it's\nimportant to repeat the main points several times --- \"Tell'em what\nyou're gonna tell'em, then tell'em, then tell'em what you told'em.\"\n\nTransitions: Transitions are hard for people --- when you transition\nfrom the Intro to the first major section, from one major section to\nanother, or from the last major section to the Summary.  You have to\ndraw explicit attention to the fact that you're changing the subject.\nUse the transition to restate the previous section and preview the\nnext.  \".... So that was the first major section.  You saw that the\nimportant points were A, B, and C.  Now we're going to turn to the\nsecond section.  The important points will be P, Q, and R. ....\"\n\nAvoid Too Much Detail: You don't have the time, and your audience\ndoesn't have the attention span, for you to tell everything you know\nabout the topic.  You have to pick what you're going to tell and what\nyou're going to leave out.  This means, leave out the details.  This\nis also how you control the length of a talk --- more details, longer\ntalk; less details, shorter talk.\n\nGive Enough Details To Be Interesting: However, often it is the\ndetails that are most interesting, because they make the talk \"real.\"\nThe best compromise here is to pick *ONE* of the major sections,\nwhichever is most interesting, and go into details *ONLY* in that\nsection.  Keep the other sections at a brief high-level overview.\n\nProvide Background Information: Be sure to provide the background info\nyour audience needs to appreciate the talk.  Don't worry if it seems\nlike you're saying simple things that the audience already knows ---\nhalf your audience won't know them and will appreciate your saying\nthem, the other half will get to feel good about themselves because\nthey're so smart they already know them.  Be sure to go ahead and say\nthe simple background things the audience needs to know.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
