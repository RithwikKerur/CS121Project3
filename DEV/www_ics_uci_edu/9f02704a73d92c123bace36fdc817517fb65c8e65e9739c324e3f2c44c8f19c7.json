it uses Googletest cases that we supply with the testing\r\n    instruments that we distribute.\r\n  You will learn about these tools in Programming Assignment #0.\r\n  Here are a few hints to ensure that you will understand the grading process\r\n    better and minimize your point loss.\r\n  <ol>\r\n  <li>Ensure that you submit the code you wrote, not empty files nor the\r\n        original files that you downloaded.\r\n      Be very careful and <b>double-check</b> what you submit to avoid this\r\n        mistake: <b>if you are not sure that you submitted the correct code,\r\n        resubmit it</b>.\r\n      After submitting (the correct file) to <b>Checkmate</b>, ensure that it\r\n        shows the assignment's status as completely submitted.\r\n  <p>\r\n  <li>If you are submitting with a partner, ensure that the <b>Submitter</b>\r\n        and <b>Partner</b> lines of the program are correctly specified.\r\n      The names must appear in the exact format required, with no misspellings\r\n        nor punctuation errors.\r\n      The student listed as <b>Submitter</b> must be the one who actually\r\n        submits the code.\r\n      See the <a href=\"assignments.html\">Programming Assignments</a> web page\r\n        for the exact form required (and you must follow that exact form, with\r\n        no misspelling nor punctuation errors).\r\n  <p>\r\n  <li>Ensure that you submit your code on time.\r\n      We can, and mostly do, ignore work submitted after the deadline\r\n        (even by a few minutes).\r\n      It is a fairness issue for other students who do submit on time.\r\n      The best strategy is to finish the work and submit it well before the\r\n         deadline (and get extra credit points): by submitting early, you will\r\n         learn more too, if you aren't rushing to meet a deadline.\r\n      To ensure that we will grade something, submit partially complete code\r\n         ahead of the deadline; then, if you miss the deadline, we will still\r\n         grade the partially complete code.\r\n      Be warned: Checkmate can get bogged down if many students all try to\r\n        submit a few minutes before the due time, so do not wait until the\r\n        last minute to submit your code.\r\n      <b>Submit your code immediately when you finish; you can always remove a\r\n          submission and resubmit corrected code later</b>\r\n  <p>\r\n  <li>Ensure that you test your code using the Googletests that we provide\r\n        and use for grading.\r\n      By using these self-checks, you will know when your code contains\r\n        errors that will result in point deductions when we grade it.\r\n      The actual tests that we will use for grading might be a bit different,\r\n        but will be similar in form and content: so, think a bit about testing\r\n        your code beyond the self-checks that we supply.\r\n      No finite amount of testing can show that code is correct for all inputs.\r\n  <p>\r\n  <li>Ensure that your files...\r\n      <ol type=\"a\">\r\n          <li>...build correctly: build without any compiler or linker warnings\r\n               or errors using <b>Clang C++</b>.\r\n          <li>...are \"uncommented\" (commented-out code will often compile and\r\n                link, but not run correctly).\r\n      </ol>\r\n      <p>\r\n      Any build errors, will cause <b>all Googletests to fail</b> during\r\n         automatic grading.\r\n      You must replace function/method bodies with code that compiles,\r\n        even if it produces incorrect results when run.\r\n  </ol>\r\nAfter an assignment is graded automatically, the Announcement for it will\r\n  contain a link to an Excel file that you can examine for detailed information\r\n  about how your score was computed.\r\n<p>\r\nIf this information does not match your expectations from running the\r\n  assignment's self-checks while developing your code, contact your TA/Reader.\r\nIt is best to meet with your TA/Reader during their common-lab hours: he/she\r\n  can talk to you about your code and run it while you are present, to help\r\n  resolve the difference.\r\nBut, if we have to modify your code to grade it properly (see the typical source\r\n  of problems above), we will deduct points.\r\nI hope that by students carefully writing/submitting their code, these\r\n  grading anomalies and point deductions will be minimized during the quarter.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>\r\n  #4: 9/26/19<br>\r\n  Communication\r\n</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  There are many ways to communicate with me (and other staff and students).\r\n  Here is a quick overview.\r\n  <ol>\r\n  <li><b>Email</b>:\r\n      If you send me email, please do it through your <b>UCI email address</b>.\r\n      Include a well-thought <b>Subject</b> line.\r\n      Also, please include your <b>full name</b> and the <b>course</b>\r\n        (<b>ICS-46</b>).\r\n      I teach many hundreds of students each quarter in multiple courses.\r\n      Providing this information helps me quickly determine the context of your\r\n        email, so I can better answer it.\r\n      Finally, when I respond to your email, please\r\n        <b>do not send a \"Thank you\"</b> acknowledgement.\r\n      Such niceties are not necessary for work-related email.\r\n      For me, it just increases the number of emails that I must read.\r\n      <p>\r\n  </ol>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Note that for questions that are not specific to you -questions that are\r\n    relevant to the entire class- it is best to ask them in the appropriate\r\n    Piazza Message Folders.\r\n  <ol start=\"2\">\r\n  <li><b>Piazza Message Folders</b>:\r\n      Post in the Folder most closely related to your question.\r\n      Include a well-thought <b>Subject</b> line that clearly identifies the\r\n        issue you are asking about;

if you have successfully downloaded and installed this\r\n    software, please help other students do so too.\r\n  Finally, you can also use the Piazza Message Folders to ask questions about\r\n    installing this software and help other students install it.\r\n\r\n  <p>\r\n  I strongly suggest that you <b>BACKUP YOUR WORK</b> daily: computers can\r\n    malfunction, break, or be stolen.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>\r\n  #1: 9/26/19<br>\r\n  First Message\r\n</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\n  Welcome to ICS-46.\r\n  I am going to post and archive important messages about the class in this\r\n    announcements web page: each entry will be numbered, dated, and labeled.\r\n  The entries will appear in reverse chronological order.\r\n  Whenever you follow the link to this page, scan its top for new announcements;\r\n    scan downward for older announcements.\r\n  This message will always appear at the bottom of this file. \r\n  I will never remove a message from this page\r\n  <p>\r\n  I have already posted some important messages before the start of the quarter.\r\n  Expect a few new messages to be posted here each week, mostly regarding\r\n    returned and graded work.\r\n  <p>\r\n  Check this Announcements page, along with your email, and Piazza Folders\r\n     daily.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\">\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
