Your examples may show a misapplication or misunderstanding\nof the principles or may be a particularly good example; in either case,\ndescribe and analyze each example using the terms and guidelines that pertain\nto the topic it illustrates.  If your example is a negative one, suggest\nan improvement and describe why your suggestion is better.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A dozen pithy lines of text should be sufficient\n(where &quot;pithy&quot; means clean, clear, well-organized, terse, and\nnot padded) for each of the three examples; half a page for each is an absolute\nmaximum.  (Again, this refers just to the text; you will probably use more\nthan half a page each, counting illustrations.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B>  How many different items have\nyou recorded in your HCI notebook so far?  We&#39;ll give full credit for\nany truthful answer to this, even zero, but we&#39;d like to know how much\nuse the class is making of these notebooks.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(c)</B>  Look at the HP Cooltown video\n(giving a vision of ubiquitous computing) at </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://cooltown.hp.com/mpulse/backissues/0601/0601-cooltown.asp\">http://cooltown.hp.com/mpulse/backissues/0601/0601-cooltown.asp</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>,\nconsidering it in terms of agents, anthropomorphism, social conventions,\nand its emotional effects on its users.  You may answer in terms of the\ntechnological vision (i.e., assuming that the system will be implemented\nessentially as described in the video) or in terms of technological realities\nand limitations (i.e., considering what difficulties might actually prevent\nthe video&#39;s vision from being realized), or both.  What social and emotional\neffects, especially unintended ones, might Cooltown produce?</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Give your reaction, opinion, and analysis\nof these issues in half a (single-spaced) page, with one page as a maximum.\n At that relatively short length, of course you won&#39;t be able to cover\nevery aspect in depth; just show us that you&#39;ve thought seriously about\nthese issues.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(d)</B>  This part is preparation for a\nlater assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Pick a partner who is also enrolled in the\nclass.  Together, find three different application programs that perform\nthe same function.  Choose applications that do something relatively simple:\n Rather than a word processor or a database or a graphics editor, choose\na desktop calculator, a virtual alarm clock, a Shanghai game, an instant\nmessaging client, or any other single-function tool.  Identify three different\nversions (perhaps using shareware sources on the Internet; nobody should\nhave to purchase anything for this assignment) and install them on a machine\n(or machines) you can use.  It would also be acceptable to choose three\nweb sites with similar aims (e.g., the travel sites Expedia, Orbitz, and\nTravelocity), though they may be more complex than single-function applications.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>In a later assignment, we will ask you to\ncompare the user interfaces of these applications.  They are likely to have\nsome differences in functionality, but we will ask you to concentrate on\ntasks that all three perform and the HCI aspects of those comparable tasks.\n For now, though, just find a partner, decide on an application category,\nand locate and install the software (or locate the web sites).  You don&#39;t\nneed to turn anything in for this part.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Combine all your answers into one electronic\ndocument and submit it via Checkmate.  (The guidelines about hand-drawn\nillustrations also apply.)</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Written by David G.
