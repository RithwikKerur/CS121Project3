A customer presents\na starting city and demands\na route with perhaps several train connections taking him to his\ndestination as early as possible.\nThe booking office must find the best route for its customers. This\nproblem was first considered\nin the theory of algorithms by George Minty, who reduced it to a\nproblem on directed\nweighted graphs: find a path from a given source to a given target\nsuch that the consecutive\nweights on the path are nondecreasing and the last weight on the path\nis minimized. Minty gave\nthe first algorithm for the single source version of the problem, in\nwhich one finds minimum last\nweight nondecreasing paths from the source to every other vertex. In\nthis paper we give the first\nlinear time algorithm for this problem. We also define an all pairs\nversion for the problem and\ngive a strongly polynomial truly subcubic algorithm for it.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
