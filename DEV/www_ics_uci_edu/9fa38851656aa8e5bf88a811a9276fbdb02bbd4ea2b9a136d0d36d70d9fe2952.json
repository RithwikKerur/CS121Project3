It is essential that you attend the lecture and lab you're officially enrolled in; the class is too full to accommodate &quot;visiting.&quot; Most of your lab work will be done in pairs,\n  so the scheduled lab times are the best times to\n  work with your partner. Because the labs are  full, switching lab or lecture sections\n  is not automatically supported by the WebReg system. <!-- We can't promise there's a way\n  around this, but we're looking and if we find one we'll let the class know.\n  if you want to\n  change your enrollment from one lab section to another, you need to\n  find a person who wants to make the opposite change and the two of you\n  must go in person to the ICS Student Affairs Office as soon as\n  possible, but definitely before the end of the second week. -->\n<!-- Note that\n  lab sections 14 through 18 are &quot;laptop only sections&quot;; in accordance with the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/Laptop_ComputerUse.php\">ICS Laptop Policy</a>, students in those sections are required to bring a laptop computer to every section meeting.--></p>\n<P>\n  <B>Office hours:  </B>You are welcome to drop by my office at any time.

I may adjust these times at the end of the first week. Of course emergencies\n  may come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change. I'll\n  also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't skip it  without getting in touch).

Thus, comparison of scores between TAs is meaningless.</P>\n<P><FONT >Lab scores will be recorded on the web at gradescope.com . We will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we\n  must ask that you bring your TA your grading questions within a week after the\n  item is returned; the course moves quickly and we simply can&#39;t deal\nwith assignments long past.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT >Our goal is to obtain the fairest overall grade outcomes. We find that we achieve this best by not committing in advance to a specific fixed point scale for assigning final letter grades in the course. Thus, no letter grades apply to anything until the end of the course and it is not possible to calculate your letter grade precisely until all the work has been done. Don't ask, &quot;What grade am I getting so far?&quot;; instead ask, &quot;What more can I do to master the material?&quot; or &quot;What should I have done differently on this assignment (or exam)?&quot; We urge everyone to focus not on letter grades but on learning what's necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</FONT> You should check gradescope.com <!--the EEE gradebook --> periodically to make sure your assignment scores have been recorded correctly. Gradescope <!--EEE--> also indicates where your score falls compared to other students; if you find yourself in the bottom quarter consistently, talk with your TA or the instructor.</P>\n<P>We're required to say that in unusual circumstances, these policies may change, but we do not expect that to happen.</P>\n<P>\n<FONT ><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations.

You\n  will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about parts\n  that aren&#39;t clear. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >The assignments, like all technical specifications,\n  require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back\n  to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about\n  what&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure\n  to read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Start each assignment early.  Assignments will\n  be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly every\n  day, especially after the first couple of weeks.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will,\n  even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll\n  have time to ask in lab about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >If you find yourself having trouble or getting\n  behind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  We have lots of ways to help.\n  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and\n  turning it in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on\n  a lab assignment or exam. ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more\n  complete discussion, see our course collaboration guidelines (<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html</code></a>) and the ICS departmental web page covering academic\nhonesty issues (</FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty</code></A><FONT >).</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Turn in whatever portion of an assignment you\n  have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something\n  rather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances\n  you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after the\n  due date, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date\n  comes.  Likewise, don&#39;t skip any quizzes or partner evaluations if you can help it; too many zeroes will significantly lower your overall score.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Always keep your own copy of each assignment,\n  both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\n  shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),\n  we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT ><B>Approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n</p><TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0>\n  <COL WIDTH=8% />\n  <COL WIDTH=15% />\n  <COL WIDTH=77% />\n  <TR>\n    <TD WIDTH=6% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Week</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=8% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Date</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=86% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Topics </U></FONT></TD>\n  </TR>\n  <!--\n  <TR>\n    <TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
