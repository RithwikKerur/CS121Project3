As an early\r\nsuccessional species, the Coral Tree grows well in the intense sunlight\r\nof open pasture. As the tree grows, it casts shade, creating a more\r\nhospitable environment for neighboring seedlings. The roots of the\r\nCoral Tree also host bacteria that \"fix\" (or produce) the important\r\nnutrient nitrogen. The added nitrogen is not only used by the Coral\r\nTree but by neighboring plants as well , making it a valuable species\r\nin restoration.</p>\r\n<p class=\"images\"><a href=\"Erythrina_3.jpg\"><img src=\"Erythrina_3_th.jpg\" alt=\"Erythrina Tree\"></a><a href=\"Erythrina_1.jpg\"><img src=\"Erythrina_1_th.jpg\" alt=\"Erythrina Flower\"></a></p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nHeliconia Plant (Scientific name: <i>Heliconia pogonantha</i>)</b><br>\r\n<class =\"images\"><a href=\"Heliconia_4.JPG\"><img src=\"Heliconia_4_th.JPG\" alt=\"Heliconia Plant\" align=\"left\"></a>\r\nHeliconia are a diverse group of plants often found in the understory\r\nof tropical forests. They tend to grow best under the partial shade of\r\na tree or in small forest gaps. They are best recognized by their giant\r\nleaves (4 ft!) and large colorful bracts (3 ft) that hold hundreds of\r\nflowers. Heliconia in Costa Rica are almost always pollinated by\r\nhummingbirds. </class></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nTabebuia Tree (Scientific name: <i>Tabebuia ochracea</i>)</b><br><class =\"images\"><a href=\"Tabebuia_1.JPG\"><img src=\"Tabebuia_1_th.JPG\" alt=\"Tabebuia Tree\" align=\"left\"></a>\r\nThe Tabebuia Tree is a late successional species found throughout Costa\r\nRica. They can grow up to 90 feet tall! However, Tabebuia are best\r\nknown for their spectacular \"mass blooms\" where all trees in an area\r\nflower together within a few days of each other. The yellow flowers\r\nattract bees that carry pollen from one tree to the next. Unlike the\r\nCoral Tree, Tabebuia seeds grow best under the shade of other plants.\r\nIn time, they will grow above the early successional trees and replace\r\nthem.</class></p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nCentropogon vine (Scientific name: <i>Centropogon granulosus</i>)</b><br><class =\"images\"><a href=\"Centropogon_vine_1.jpg\"><img src=\"Centropogon_vine_1_th.jpg\" alt=\"Centropogon vine\" align=\"left\"></a>\r\nAs a vine, Centropogon relies on other plants for support. The vine begins its life in the shady understory, climbing steadily \r\nupward until it reaches the full sun of the uppoer canopy. With its extremely long, curved tubular flowers, Centropogon is only \r\naccessible to hummingbirds with similarly long, curved bills, such as the White-tipped Sicklebill.</class></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nRufous-tailed Hummingbird (Scientific name: <i>Amazilia tzacatl</i>)</b><br>\r\n<class =\"images\"><a href=\"colorful.JPG\"><img src=\"colorful.JPG\" width\"112\" height=\"75\" align=\"left\"></a>\r\nRufous-tailed Hummingbirds are one of the most aggressive of the\r\nterritorial Costa Rican hummingbirds. Although small even for a\r\nhummingbird (4 in.; 5.2 g), the Rufous-tailed frequently chases larger\r\nbirds away from its precious flowers. You can find this species in open\r\nhabitats and along forest edges.</p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nLong-billed Starthroat (Scientific name: <i>Heliomaster longirostris</i>)</b><br>\r\n<class =\"images\"><a href=\"gray.JPG\"><img src=\"gray.JPG\" width\"112\" height=\"75\" align=\"left\"></a>\r\nAs the name suggests, the Long-billed Starthroat has a long, straight\r\nbill for feeding on the nectar of long tubular flowers, like those of\r\nthe Coral Tree. Like the Rufous-tailed Hummingbird, it defends small\r\npatches of flowers against other hummingbirds. The bright red feathers\r\non the throat of a male Long-billed Starthroat shimmer under the right\r\nangle of light. This flash of color is used to catch the eyes of\r\npotential mates!</p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nViolet Sabrewing (Scientific name: <i>Camplyoterus hemileucurus</i>)</b><br>\r\n<class =\"images\"><a href=\"blue.JPG\"><img src=\"blue.JPG\" width\"112\" height=\"75\" align=\"left\"></a>\r\nThis beautiful hummingbird is often found along forest edges and\r\nunderstory, visiting flowers of Heliconia. Although a relatively large\r\nhummingbird (11.5 g; 6 in.), the Violet Sabrewing does not usually\r\ndefend territories. Instead, it follows a \"trap-line\" of small flower\r\npatches that it revisits several times throughout the day. </p>\r\n<p><b>\r\nGreen Hermit (Scientific name: <i>Phaethornis guy</i>)</b><br>\r\n<class =\"images\"><a href=\"green.JPG\"><img src=\"green.JPG\" width\"112\" height=\"75\" align=\"left\"></a>\r\nAnother understory, trap-line species is the Green Hermit (6 in.; 6 g).\r\nIt has a long, decurved bill for sipping nectar from Heliconia flowers.\r\nMales congregate on leks of up to 20 individuals where they sing and\r\ndisplay to attract a female.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h2>Deforestation and Restoration</h2>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<p><b>What is ecological succession?</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\nEnvironments are constantly changing. When changes occur, such as the\r\navailability of water, nutrients, and sunlight, the types of plant and\r\nanimals that inhabit these environments can also change. Biologists\r\ncall this process ecological succession. Ecological succession is the\r\ngradual change in the kinds of plants, animals, and other organisms\r\nthat live in an ecosystem as it ages with time. For convenience,\r\nsuccession is often broken down into three stages: early, middle, and\r\nlate stage succession.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPlants and animals that live within the same stage of succession often\r\nshare similarities with one another. For example, plants that inhabit\r\nearly successional stages tend to grow rapidly, and do so under high\r\nlight and low nutrient availability. In contrast, late successional\r\nplant species grow slowly and prefer shadier habitats.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOne of the goals of EcoRaft is to present these patterns and illustrate\r\nhow they can be used to improve restoration. One important pattern is\r\nthat degraded environments tend to look a lot like environments in\r\nearly successional stage. Introducing species that naturally grow well\r\nin early succession may therefore grow well in degraded environments,\r\nproviding a jump start to restoration. Middle and late successional\r\nspecies can then move in, hastening what is usually a very slow process.</p>\r\n<p><b>What is ecological restoration?</b></p>\r\n<p>\r\nEcological restoration is the field of science concerned with understanding degraded environments and discovering ways of \r\nreturning them to their original state.  Tropical ecosystems can become degraded many ways, including by logging and \r\nintensive farming.  When the land can no longer support these activities, it is often abandoned.  Tropical ecosystems are \r\nparticularly vulnerable to this process because of their nutrient poor soils and the heavy rainfall that quickly washes away \r\nthe thin top soil.  Unfortunately, forests may not grow back to their original state without human assistance.  The goal of \r\nrestoration ecologists is to find ways to initiate or speed up this recovery process.  Your goal as an EcoRaft user is to \r\nrestore the rainforests of several tropical islands.  Just like in nature, the fate of your EcoRaft ecosystem will depend on \r\nhow you choose to take care of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p> <b>Why is ecological restoration important?</b> </p><p>\r\nEcological restoration is important for many reasons. Ecological\r\nrestoration re-establishes the interactions between plants, animals and\r\ntheir environments. Restored ecosystems also provide food and shelter\r\nfor wildlife. They also offer valuable services to people including\r\nclean water, protection from natural disasters like floods and\r\nlandslides, and place for recreation and rejuvenation. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Advice to the young restoration biologist</b>\r\n</p><p>\r\nOne of the most important parts to being a good biologist is to\r\ncarefully observe your surroundings. What do you see, smell, and hear\r\naround you? For example, do you see or hear animals? Do the flowers\r\nhave a pleasant scent? What shape are they? These are the kinds of\r\nquestions biologists ask themselves when exploring the natural world.\r\nYou will need to use your own power of observation to understand and\r\nrestore the EcoRaft ecosystem. </p><p>For more \r\ninformation about restoration ecology, please visit <a href=\"http://darwin.bio.uci.edu/%7Eflcarpen/\">Lynn Carpenter's web \r\nsite</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p><small>Last updated: September 1, 2005</small></p></td></tr></tbody></table>\r\n</body></html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
