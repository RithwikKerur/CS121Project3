Teamware allows users \nto explicitly define their software development process and provides \nextensive execution support. In addition, Teamware is designed for \nnon-technical as well as technical users, and is appropriate for use by \nmanagers, programmers, domain experts, and customer representatives. \nIt also provides support for company-, site-, or project-specific \ncustomization.\n</P>\n\n<P>\nDuring process execution, Teamware provides a summary of assignments for \neach team member. As each assignment is completed, Teamware informs \nappropriate managers and team members, and updates the shared project view. \nIt also coordinates handoff of artifacts, tool interaction, and resource \nassignments. Further automation can be provided depending on the user's \nenvironment. This automation can include, for example, automatic invocation \nof tools, automated forwarding of documents to reviewers, or interaction \nwith metrics gathering tools.\n</P>\n\n\n<A NAME = \"Features\"><H2>\nSummary of System Features\n</H2>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Support for Non-Technical Personnel</b> - The language and system are \ndesigned to support non-technical users as well as technical users. \nNon-technical managers, domain experts, accounting, marketing, and support \nstaff are able to both read and write programs using the Teamware language.\n\n<li><b>Company, Site, or Project Customizable</b> - Companies or projects \ncan customize Teamware to meet their specific needs. New activity, artifact, \nand resource types can be defined.\n\n<li><b>Facilitates Integration with External Tools</b> - Teamware's object \nmodel is designed to facilitate integration with any external tools providing \nan API. Teamware's agenda tool and default mail system, for example, can be \nreplaced with the time-management and mail systems preferred by a particular \nsite. In addition, meeting room schedulers, project management tools, and other \nsite-specific tools can be integrated in using the object model.\n\n<li><b>Object-Oriented</b> - Teamware's activity, artifact, and resource \ndefinitions are object-oriented. Users can create new definitions which \ninherit the properties of existing definitions.\n\n<li><b>Multiple-Viewing Formalisms Supportable</b> - While Teamware provides \na default view of the process similar to PERT charts, it also provides an API \nallowing access for viewing and editing using other viewers. Future viewers are \nplanned including IDEF. In addition, users can define their own viewers.\n\n<li><b>Dynamic Response to Project Changes</b> - Teamware provides flexibility \nas the project changes. Teamware activities, activity networks, and activity, \nartifact, and resource types can be changed dynamically as the process \nexecutes.\n</ul>\n\n<A NAME = \"Definition\"><H2>\nProcess Definition in Teamware\n</H2>\n\n<p>\nTeamware allows definition of the activities, artifacts, and resources \nassociated with the software development process. These items can be defined \nhierarchically, thus an activity can be further subdivided into subactivities, \nwhile a software development team resource can be further defined to include \nteam member resources or subteam resources. In addition, Teamware activity \nnetworks define the interelationships between activities, artifacts, and \nresources. Networks include definition of control flow, data flow, and \nresource assignments. Teamware's default activity network viewer provides \na PERT-like view of the activities, however additional viewers can be defined \nusing Teamware's API. An IDEF0 viewer, for example, is planned.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nTeamware provides a high degree of extensibility and flexibility in process \ndefinitions. Teamware provides object-oriented hierarchies of activity, \nartifact, and resource categories. Users can customize or extend the existing \ncategories to meet their specific needs. Thus, if a company uses a different \ne-mail system than mh (Teamware's default system), a new e-mail system can \nbe easily integrated. Similarly, if a project needs a new resource type \nnot found in Teamware, the existing resource hierarchy can be extended.\n</p>\n\n<h2><A NAME = \"Platform\">\nPlatform\n</h2>\n\n<p>\nThe initial implementation of Teamware has been developed running Sun OS 4.2 \nor higher. It utilizes Sun Ada, gcc, and \n<A HREF=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python</A>. \nAPI's are provided for both \nAda and Python. Default viewers provided are built on top of the ARPA-sponsored \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/Chiron/chiron.html\">Chiron User Interface Management System</A>.\n</p>\n\n<h2><A NAME = \"Availability\"> \nAvailability\n</h2>\n\n<p>\nTeamware is public domain software with full source distribution.\nTeamware-1.1 is written completely in \n<A HREF=\"http://java.sun.com/\">Java</A>(tm) and is set for release\non the web sometime in the second quarter, 1996.\nObject handlers are currently supported in Python and Java; support\nfor Ada95 and Tcl are currently underway. \n\nIf you are interested in becoming a beta-tester, \n<A HREF=\"mailto:teamware-local@ics.uci.edu\">please contact us</A>. \n</p>\n\n<HR>\n<h2> <A NAME = \"Example\">\nExample Teamware Activity Network using default viewer.\n</h2>\n<IMG SRC=\"network.gif\">\n<HR>\n<h2><A NAME = \"Personnel\">\nCurrent Project Personnel\n</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><A HREF=\"http:/dir/visitor/pyoung\">Patrick S.
