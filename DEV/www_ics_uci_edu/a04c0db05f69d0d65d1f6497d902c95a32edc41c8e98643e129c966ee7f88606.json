You\nmay use whatever outside sources (books, friends, interviews, periodicals)\nare appropriate for an assignment, so long as you cite them:  Any time you\nuse two or more words in a row that you didn&#39;t think up and write yourself,\nyou must put the words in quotation marks and indicate where they came from.\n (There could be situations where this two-word rule isn&#39;t appropriate.\n If you think you have one, check with us.)  Even if you paraphrase (state\nin your own words) someone else&#39;s work or ideas, you should cite the\nsource (e.g., &quot;Dijkstra says that unrestricted branching is dangerous.&quot;).\n Plagiarism is academically dishonest, and we expect that nobody in the\nclass will engage in it.  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>That should be enough said, but unfortunately\nthere have been instances of plagiarism in these courses in the past.  To\nprotect the value of the independent work that all students do, all student\nwork in this course may be compared for textual analysis and evidence of\nplagiarism to the work of other students, both in this course and in others,\nboth manually and by using software that compares students&#39; work with\nwork from other sources, including the Internet and work submitted in previous\nquarters.  This may involve the storage of students&#39; work on computer\nsystems outside of the university, such as the Turnitin.com reference database;\nthis storage is solely for purposes of detecting plagiarism.  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>ICS school policy is that plagiarists fail\nthe course and have their offense recorded in the department office.  Academic\nhonesty violations can affect a student&#39;s graduation, financial aid,\nand eligibility for honors.  The school deals with plagiarism cases every\nquarter, even though most people don&#39;t hear about them.  No matter how\npressured you feel, don&#39;t plagiarize; it&#39;s not worth it.</FONT></P>\n<BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
