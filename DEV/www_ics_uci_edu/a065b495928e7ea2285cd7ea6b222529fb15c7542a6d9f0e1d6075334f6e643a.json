They had three daughters, the eldest Ruth \r\nmarried a Dave Langsam in 1939.  They had one son Martin born in 1945.  Ruth \r\nwas blind and the family did not feel that she could take care of Martin and \r\nhe was adopted by another sister by the name of Myrtle who was married to \r\nLester Kirklin and they raised him.  I do not know if this is any relation to \r\nyour David Langsam.\r\n\r\nJoan Brashem  \r\n_______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nDate: Wed, 21 Jun 2000 21:39:09 -0700\r\nTo: JoFlBr@aol.com\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: re: David Langsam\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nJust wanted to follow up (thanks again for your response).
