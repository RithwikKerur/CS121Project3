We work together with a common ambition:\nTo meet, encourage and help each other succeed and gain equal\nopportunity for women in a challenging field. <p align=\"center\"><img src=\"WICS%2006-07%20About%20WICS.jpg\" height=\"238\" width=\"357\"></p>\n\n\n      <p><span class=\"subtitle\"><img src=\"Bullet.png\" height=\"17\" width=\"17\"> Facts about the percentage of Women enrolled in Computer Sciences:</span></p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Women\nin Information And Computer Sciences (WICS) is an organization which\nhelps encourage young women to be successful in the technological\nfields. These are strong women determined to support and encourage\nother fellow peers who are pursuing a degree from the school of\nInformation and Computer Sciences, as well as in all other Computer\nScience related fields.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>The\norganization has much to offer, such as outreach programs to primary\nand secondary school students, networking with faculty, and with\nbusiness people and companies outside of UCI, as well as workshops to\nimprove their interview skills and help them become even more\nsuccessful in the future.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Although\nfemale students make up 50% of high school Computer Science (CS)\nclasses, the percentage enrolled in CS programs in college is\nsignificantly less. According to the National Center for Education\nStatistics at the U.S. Department of Education, the percentage of\nbachelor's degrees in CS awarded to women in the 1993-94 academic year\nwas only 28.4% (the last year for which they have published figures).</li>\n      </ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>These\nnumbers have been dropping steadily from a high point in 1983, when 37%\nof the bachelor's degrees awarded in CS went to women. (Note that the\npercentage of all bachelor's degrees awarded to women was 50% in\n1983-84 and 55% in 1993-94.) At the graduate level, the percentages are\nbetter, but still dropping for master's degrees in CS, with a high of\n29% awarded to women in 1983-84 down to 25% in 1993-94. For Ph.D.\ndegrees, the picture is better, with a high of 15% in 1993-94 (10% in\n1983-84).</li>\n      </ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>More recent\nstatistics come from the 1997-98 CRA Taulbee Survey of departments that\ngrant Ph.D.s in Computer Science. The percentage of bachelor's degrees\nin CS awarded to women in the 1997-98 academic year was only 16%.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>For\ngraduate degrees awarded in CS in 1997-98, the percentage of master's\nand Ph.D. degrees awarded to women were 22% and 14%, respectively. In\naddition, only 16% assistant professors, 12% associate professors, and\n8% full professors are women in CS Ph.D.-granting departments.</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>&nbsp;</p>\n      <p><span class=\"subtitle\"><img src=\"Bullet.png\" height=\"17\" width=\"17\"> How the Bren School helps Women in the Information and Computer Science fields: </span></p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>UC\nIrvine's Information and Computer Science (ICS) department hosts the\nlargest computing major at any UC Campus with 1,361 undergraduate\nmajors, 58 MS students, 258 Ph.D. students, and 3800 Alumni <br>\n        (Source: Student Characteristics Summary, Fall 2004).</li>\n      </ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>Out\nof the total of 1,375 ICS students, 248 are females (16.5%). ICS has 37\nfull-time regular ranks faculty members, of which seven are women\n(almost 20%, well above the average nationwide of 11%.)</li>\n      </ul>\n      <ul>\n        <li>By\njoining student clubs such as WICS, female students can surround\nthemselves with their peers and positive influences who, not only work\nwith and can assist them with their classes and curriculum, but can\nalso help them network with other successful women, giving them even\nmore opportunities to succeed. </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p class=\"style55\">&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"header\">\n  <img src=\"NewHeader4.png\" height=\"198\" width=\"767\"> </div>\n\n  <!--\r\n  <div id=\"container-footer\">\r\n  <div id=\"content-footer\">\r\n    <div class=\"style26\">\r\n      <div id=\"textpadding\">\r\n        <div align=\"right\" class=\"style123\"><strong><span class=\"style68\"> <br />\r\n        </span></strong><span class=\"style68\"> Copyright &copy; UC Irvine, 2006 - 2009.
