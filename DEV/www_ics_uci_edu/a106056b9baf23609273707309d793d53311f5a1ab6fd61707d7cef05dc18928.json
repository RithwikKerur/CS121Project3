Enter a modern home and you\nare surrounded by standards and categories spanning the color of paint\non the walls and in the fabric of the furniture, the types of wires strung\nto appliances, the codes in the building permits allowing the kitchen sink\nto be properly plumbed and the walls to be adequately fireproofed. Ignore\nthese forms at your peril \u2013 as a building owner, be sued by irate tenants;\nas an inspector, risk malpractice suits denying your proper application\nof the ideal to the case at hand; as a parent, risk toxic paint threatening\nyour children.\n<p>To classify is human. Not all classifications take formal shape or are\nstandardized in commercial and bureaucratic products. We all spend large\nparts of our days doing classification work, often tacitly, and make up\nand use a range of <i>ad hoc</i> classifications in order to do so. We\nsort dirty dishes from clean, white laundry from colorfast, important email\nto be answered from e-junk. We match the size and type of our car tires\nto the amount of pressure they should accept. Our desktops are a mute testimony\nto a kind of muddled folk classification: papers which must read by yesterday,\n<i>but\nwhich have been there since last year</i>; old professional journals which\nreally should be read and even in fact may someday be, <i>and which have\nbeen there since last year</i>; assorted grant applications, tax forms,\nvarious work-related surveys and forms waiting to be filled out for everything\nfrom parking spaces to immunizations. These surfaces may be piled with\nsentimental cards which are already read <i>but which can\u2019t yet be thrown\nout</i> alongside reminder notes to send similar cards to parents, sweethearts,\nor to friends for their birthdays, all piled on top of last year\u2019s calendar\n(which who knows, may be useful at tax time). Any part of the home, school\nor workplace reveals some such system of classification: medications classed\nas not for children occupy a higher shelf than safer ones; books for reference\nare shelved close to where we do the Sunday crossword puzzle; door keys\nare color-coded and stored according to frequency of use.\n<p>What sorts of things order these piles, locations, and implicit labels?\nWe have certain knowledge of these intimate spaces, classifications that\nseem to live partly in our hands \u2013 definitely not just in the head or in\nany formal algorithm. The knowledge about which thing will be useful at\nany given moment is embodied in a flow of mundane tasks and practices and\nmany varied social roles (child, boss, friend, employee). When we need\nto put our hands on something, it is there.\n<p>Our computer desktops are no less cluttered. Here the electronic equivalent\nof \"not yet ready to throw out\" is also well represented. A quick scan\nof one of the author\u2019s desktops reveals seven residual categories represented\nin the various folders of email and papers: \"fun\" \"take back to office\"\n\"remember to look up\" \"misc.\" \"misc. correspondence\" \"general web information\"\n\"teaching stuff to do\" and \"to do.\" We doubt if this is an unusual degree\nof disarray or an overly prolific use of the \"none of the above\" category\nso common to standardized tests and surveys.\n<p>These standards and classifications, however imbricated in our lives,\nare ordinarily invisible. The formal, bureaucratic ones trail behind them\nthe entourage of permits, forms, numerals, and the sometimes-visible work\nof people who adjust them to make organizations run smoothly. In that sense,\nthey may become more visible, especially when they break down, or become\nobjects of contention. But what <i>are </i>these categories? Who makes\nthem, and who may change them? When and why do they become visible? How\ndo they spread? What, for instance, is the relationship between locally\ngenerated categories, tailored to the particular space of a bathroom cabinet,\nand the commodified, elaborate, expensive ones generated by medical diagnoses,\ngovernment regulatory bodies, and pharmaceutical firms?\n<p>Remarkably for such a central part of our lives, we stand for the most\npart in formal ignorance of the social and moral order created by these\ninvisible, potent entities. Their impact is indisputable, and as Foucault\nreminds us, inescapable. Try the simple experiment of ignoring your gender\nclassification and use instead whichever toilets are the nearest; try to\nlocate a library book shelved under the wrong Library of Congress catalogue\nnumber; stand in the immigration queue at a busy foreign airport without\nthe right passport or arrive without the transformer and the adaptor that\ntranslates between electrical standards. The material force of categories\nappears always and instantly.\n<p>At the level of public policy, classifications such as those of regions,\nactivities, and natural resources play an equally important role. Whether\nor not a region is classified as ecologically important; whether another\nis zoned industrial or residential come to bear significantly on future\neconomic decisions. The substrate of decision-making in this area, while\noften hotly argued across political camps, is only intermittently visible.\nChanging such categories, once designated, is usually a cumbersome, bureaucratically\nfraught process.\n<p>For all this importance, classifications and standards occupy a peculiar\nplace in studies of social order. Anthropologists have studied classification\nas a device for understanding the cultures of others \u2013 categories such\nas the raw and the cooked have been clues to the core organizing principles\nfor colonial Western understandings of \"primitive\" culture. Some economists\nhave looked at the effects of adopting a standard in those markets where\nnetworks and compatibility are crucial. For example, videotape recorders,\nrefrigerators and personal computer software embody arguably inferior technical\nstandards, but standards that benefited from the timing of their historical\nentry into the marketplace. Some historians have examined the explosion\nof natural history and medical classifications in the late nineteenth century,\nboth as a political force and as an organizing rubric for complex bureaucracies.\nA few sociologists have done detailed studies of individual categories\nlinked with social movements, such as the diagnosis of homosexuality as\nan illness and its demedicalization in the wake of gay and lesbian civil\nrights. Information scientists work every day on the design, delegation\nand choice of classification systems and standards, yet few see them as\nartifacts embodying moral and aesthetic choices that in turn craft people\u2019s\nidentities, aspirations and dignity. Philosophers and statisticians have\nproduced highly formal discussions of classification theory, but few empirical\nstudies of use or impact.\n<p>Both within and outside the academy, single categories or classes of\ncategories may also become objects of contention and study. The above-mentioned\ndemedicalization of the category homosexual in the American Psychiatric\nAssociation\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 3 (the DSM, a handbook\nof psychiatric classification) followed direct and vigorous lobbying of\nthe APA by gay and lesbian advocates (Kirk and Kutchins, 1992). During\nthis same era, feminists were split on the subject of whether the categories\nof premenstrual syndrome and post partum depression would be good or bad\nfor women as they became included in the DSM. Many feminist psychotherapists\nwere engaged in a bitter argument about whether to include these categories.\nAs Ann Figert (1996) relates, they even felt their own identities and professional\njudgements to be on the line. (Allan Young (1995) makes the complicating\nobservation that psychiatrists increasingly use the language of the DSM\nto communicate with each other and their accounting departments, although\nthey frequently don\u2019t believe in the categories they are using).\n<p>More recently, as discussed in Chapter 6, the option to choose multiple\nracial categories was introduced as part of the US Government routine data\ncollection mission, following Statistical Directive 15 in October, 1997.\nThe Office of Management and Budget issued the directive, and conservatively,\nits implementation will cost several million dollars. One direct consequence\nis the addition of this option to the US Census, an addition that was fraught\nwith political passion. A march on Washington concerning the category took\nthe traditional ultimate avenue of mass protest for American activists.\nThe march was conducted by people who identified themselves as multi-racial,\nand their families and advocates. At the same time, it was vigorously opposed\nby many African-American and Hispanic civil rights groups (among several\nothers), who saw the option as a \"whitewash\" against which important ethnic\nand policy-related distinctions would be lost (Robbin, 1998).\n<p>However, despite the contentiousness of some categories, none of the\nabove-named disciplines or social movements has systematically addressed\nthe pragmatics of the invisible forces of categories and standards in the\nmodern built world, especially the modern information technology world.\nFoucault\u2019s (1970; 1982) work comes the closest to a thoroughgoing examination\nin his arguments that an archaeological dig is necessary in order to find\nthe origins and consequences of a range of social categories and practices.\nHe focussed on the concept of order, and its implementation in categorical\ndiscourse. The ubiquity described by Foucault appears as an iron cage of\nbureaucratic discipline against a broad historical landscape. But there\nis much more to be done, both empirically and theoretically. No one, including\nFoucault, has systematically tackled the question of how these properties\ninform social and moral order via the new technological and electronic\ninfrastructures. Few have looked at the creation and maintenance of complex\nclassifications as a kind of <i>work practice</i>, with its attendant financial,\nskill and moral dimensions. These are the tasks of this book.\n<p>We take Foucault\u2019s practical archaeology as a point of departure for\nexamining several cases of classification, some of which have become formal\nor standardized, and some of which have not. We have several concerns in\nthis exploration, growing both from the consideration of classification\nwork, and its attendant moral dimensions. First, we seek to understand\nthe role of invisibility in the work that classification does in ordering\nhuman interaction. We want to understand how these categories are made\nand kept invisible, and in some cases, we want to challenge the silences\nsurrounding them. In this sense, our job here is to find tools for seeing\nthe invisible, much as &Eacute;mile Durkheim passionately sought to convince\nhis audience of the material force of the social fact \u2013 to <i>see </i>that\nsociety was not just an idea \u2013 over one hundred years ago (Durkheim, 1982).\n<p>We also explore systems of classification as part of the built information\nenvironment. Much as a city planner or urban historian would leaf back\nthrough highway permits and zoning decisions to tell a city\u2019s story, we\ndelve the dusty archives of classification design in order better to understand\nhow wide-scale classification decisions have been made.\n<p>We have a moral and ethical agenda in our querying of these systems.\nEach standard and each category valorizes some point of view and silences\nanother. This is not inherently a bad thing \u2013 indeed it is inescapable.\nBut it <i>is</i> an ethical choice, and as such it is dangerous \u2013 not bad,\nbut dangerous. For example, the decision of the US Immigration and Naturalization\nService to classify some races and classes as desirable for US residents,\nand others as not, resulted in a quota system which valued affluent people\nfrom Northern and Western Europe over those (especially the poor) from\nAfrica or South America. The decision to classify students by their standardized\nachievement and aptitude tests valorizes some kinds of knowledge skills\nand renders other kinds invisible. Other types of decisions with serious\nmaterial force may not immediately appear as morally problematic. The collective\nstandardization in the United States on VHS videotapes over Betamax, for\ninstance, may seem ethically neutral. The classification and standardization\nof types of seed for farming is not obviously fraught with moral weight.\nBut as Busch (1995) and Addelson (1994) argue, such long-term, collective\nforms of choice are also morally fraught. We are used to viewing moral\nchoices as individual, as dilemmas, and as rational choices. We have an\nimpoverished vocabulary for collective moral passages, to use Addelson\u2019s\nterminology. For any individual, group or situation, classifications and\nstandards give advantage or they give suffering. Jobs are made and lost;\nsome regions benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made,\nand how we may think about that invisible matching process is at the core\nof the ethical project of this work.\n<p><b>Working Infrastructures</b>\n<p><i>Sorting Things Out</i> stands at the crossroads of sociology of knowledge\nand technology, history and information science. The categories represented\non our desktops and in our medicine cabinets are fairly ad hoc and individual,\nnot even legitimate anthropological folk or ethno classifications. They\nare not often investigated by information scientists (but see Kwasnik,\n1988, 1991; Beghtol, 1995; Star, 1998). But everyone uses and creates them\nin some form, and they are (increasingly) important in organizing computer-based\nwork. They often have old and deep historical roots. True, Personal Information\nManagers are designed precisely to make this process transparent, but even\nwith their aid, the problem continues: we still must design or select categories,\nstill enter data, still struggle with things that don\u2019t fit. At the same\ntime, we rub these <i>ad hoc</i> classifications against an increasingly\nelaborate large-scale system of formal categories and standards. Users\nof the Internet alone navigate, now fairly seamlessly, more than two hundred\nformally elected Internet standards for information transmission each time\nwe send an email message. If we are to understand larger-scale classifications,\nwe also need to understand how desktop classifications link up with those\nthat are formal, standardized, and widespread.\n<p>Every link in hypertext creates a category. That is, it reflects some\njudgment about two or more objects: they are the same, or alike, or functionally\nlinked, or linked as part of an unfolding series. The rummage sale of information\non the World Wide Web is overwhelming, and we all agree that finding information\nis much less of a problem than assessing its quality -- the nature of its\ncategorical associations, and by whom they are made (Bates, in press).\nThe historical cultural model of social classification research in this\nbook, from desktop to wide-scale infrastructure, is a good one through\nwhich to view problems of indexing, tracking, and even compiling bibliographies\non the web. In its cultural and workplace dimensions, it offers insights\ninto the problematics of design of classification systems, and a lens for\nexamining their impact. It looks at these processes as a sort of crafting\nof treaties. In this, a cross-disciplinary approach is crucial. Any information\nsystems design that neglects use and user semantics is bound for trouble\ndown the line \u2013 it will become either oppressive or irrelevant. Information\nsystems mix up the conventional and the formal, the hard technical problems\nof storage and retrieval with the hard interactional problems of querying\nand organizing.\n<p>Information systems are undergoing rapid change. There is an explosion\nof information on the World Wide Web and associated technologies, and fast\nmoving changes in how information may converge across previously disparate\nfamilies of technology \u2013 for instance, using one\u2019s television to retrieve\nemail and browse the web, using one\u2019s Internet connections to make telephone\ncalls. Whatever we write here about the latest electronic developments\nwill be outdated by the time this book sees print, a medium many would\nargue is itself anachronistic.\n<p>Conventions of use, and understandings of the impact of these changes\non social organization are slower to come. The following example illustrates\nthe intermingling of the conventional and the local in the types of classificatory\nlinks formed by hypertext. A few years ago, our university was in the enviable\nposition of having several job openings in Library and Information Science.\nBoth the authors were on the search committee. During the process of sifting\nthrough applications and finding out more about candidates, the need arose\nto query something on the candidate\u2019s resume. We used the Alta Vista search\nengine to find the candidate\u2019s email address. (Of course, the first thing\none really does with Alta Vista is egosurfing - checking one\u2019s own name\nto see how many times it appears on the web - but we had already done that.)\nHis email address and formal institutional home page appeared in about\n15 seconds on our desktop -- but so did his contributions to a discussion\non world peace, a feminist bulletin board, and one of the more arcane alt.rec\nUsenet groups. We found ourselves unable to stop our eyes from roving through\nthe quoted Usenet posts \u2013 category boundaries surely never meant to be\ncrossed by a job search committee. Fortunately for us as committee members,\nwe interpreted what we found on the web as evidence that the applicant\nwas a more well rounded person than his formal CV had conveyed. He became\na more interesting candidate.\n<p>But of course, it might have gone badly for him. In less than a minute\nwe had accessed information about him that crossed a social boundary of\n<i>de\nfacto</i> privacy, access, and awareness context (Glaser and Strauss, 1965).\nThe risk of random readership had been there in some sense when he posted\nto a public space -- but who on a search committee in the old days of a\ncouple of years ago could possibly be bothered searching ftp archives?\nWho would have time? There are many ethical and etiquette-related questions\nhere, of course, with the right to privacy not least among them. The incident\nalso points to the fact that as a culture we have not yet developed conventions\nof classification for the web that bear much moral or habitual conviction\nin daily practice. The label alt.rec does not yet have the reflex power\nthat the label private does on a desk drawer or notebook cover. We would\nnever open someone\u2019s desk drawer or diary. We are not normally known to\nbe a rude people -- but we haven\u2019t yet developed or absorbed routine similar\npoliteness for things such as powerful web search engines. We were thus\nsomewhat embarrassed and confused about the morality of mentioning the\nalt.rec postings to the committee.\n<p>As we evolve the classifications of habit -- grow common fingertips\nwith respect to linkages and networks -- we will be faced with some choices.\nHow standardized will our indexes become? What forms of freedom of association\n(between people, between texts and people, between texts) do we want to\npreserve, and which are no longer useful? Who will decide these matters?\n<p><b>Investigating Infrastructure</b>\n<p>People do many things today that a few hundred years ago would have\nlooked like magic. We all know versions of this banal assertion - we\u2019ve\nprobably all made it in one form or another or ourselves at some point.\nAnd if we don\u2019t understand a given technology it looks like magic: for\nexample, we are perpetually surprised by the mellifluous tones read off\nour favorite CDs by, we believe, a laser. Most of us have no notion of\nthe decades of negotiation that inform agreement on, inter alia, standard\ndisc size, speed, electronic setting, and amplification standards. It is\nnot dissimilar to the experience of magic one enjoys at a fine restaurant\nor an absorbing play. A common description of a good waiter or butler (one\nthinks of Jeeves in the Wodehouse stories) is that she clears a table and\nsmoothes the unfolding of events \u2018as if by magic.\u2019 In a compelling play,\nthe hours of rehearsal and missteps are disappeared from center stage,\nbehind a seamless front stage presentation. Is the magic of the CD different\nfrom the magic of the waiter or the theater ensemble? Are these two kinds\nof magic or one -- or none?\n<p>This book is an attempt to answer this question, which can be posed\nmore prosaically as:\n<ul>\n<li>\nWhat work do classifications and standards do? Again, we want to look at\nwhat goes into making things work like magic: making them fit together\nso that we can buy a radio built by someone we have never met in Japan,\nplug it into a wall in Champaign, Illinois and hear the world news from\nthe BBC.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nWho does that work? We explore the fact that all this magic involves much\nwork: there is a lot of hard labor in effortless ease. Such invisible work\nis often not only underpaid - it is severely underrepresented in theoretical\nliterature (Star and Strauss, 1999). We will discuss where all the \u2018missing\nwork\u2019 that makes things look magical goes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nWhat happens to the cases that don\u2019t fit? We want to draw attention to\ncases that don\u2019t fit easily into our magical created world of standards\nand classifications: the left handers in the world of right-handed magic,\nchronic disease sufferers in the acute world of allopathic medicine, the\nvegetarian in MacDonald\u2019s (Star, 1991b) and so forth.</li>\n</ul>\nThese are issues of great import. It is easy to get lost in Baudrillard\u2019s\n(1990) cool memories of simulacra. He argues that it is impossible to sort\nout media representations from \u2018what really happens.\u2019 We are unable to\nstand outside representation or separate simulations from nature. At the\nsame time, he pays no attention to the work of constructing the simulations,\nor the infrastructural considerations that underwrite the images/events\n(and we agree that separating them ontologically is a hopeless task). The\nhype of our postmodern times is that we don\u2019t need to think about this\nsort of <i>work</i> any more. The real issues are scientific and technological,\nstripped of the conditions of production - in artificial life, thinking\nmachines, nanotechnology, and genetic manipulation.... Clearly each of\nthese <i>is</i> important. But there is more at stake - epistemologically,\npolitically and ethically - in the day to day work of building classification\nsystems and producing and maintaining standards than in abstract arguments\nabout representation. Their pyrotechnics may hold our fascinated gaze;\nthey cannot provide any path to answering our moral questions.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">What <i>Are</i> You?</font>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">I grew up in Rhode Island, a New England state\nwhich is largely Italian-American and French-Canadian, known chiefly for\nits small stature. When I was a kid in our neighborhood, the first thing\nyou would ask on encountering a newcomer was \"what\u2019s your name?\" The second\nwas \"what are you?\" \"What are you\" was an invitation to recite your ethnic\ncomposition in a kind of singsong voice. 90% of the kids would say \"Italian\nwith a little bit of French,\" or \"half-Portuguese, one-quarter Italian\nand one-quarter Armenian.\" When I would chime in with \"half Jewish, one\nquarter Scottish and one quarter English,\" the range of responses went\nfrom very puzzled looks to \"does that mean you\u2019re not Catholic?\" Wherein,\nI guess, began my fascination with classification, and especially with\nthe problem of residual categories, or, the Other, or not elsewhere classified.</font>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">--Leigh Star</font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b><i>Two Definitions</i> : Classification and Standards</b>\n<p>Up to this point, we have been using the terms classification and standardization\nwithout formal definition. Let us clarify the terms now.\n<p><b>Classification</b>\n<p><i>A classification is a spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal segmentation\nof the world.</i> A \u2018classification system\u2019 is a set of boxes (metaphorical\nor literal) into which things can be put in order to then do some kind\nof work - bureaucratic or knowledge production. In an abstract, ideal sense,\na classification system exhibits the following properties:\n<ol>\n<li>\n<i>There are consistent, unique classificatory principles in operation</i>.\nOne common sort of system here is the <i>genetic</i> principle of ordering.\nThis refers not to DNA analysis, but an older and simpler sense of the\nword: classifying things by their origin and descent (Tort, 1989). A genealogical\nmap of a family\u2019s history of marriage, birth and death is genetic in this\nsense (even for adopted children and in-laws). So is a flow chart showing\na hierarchy of tasks deriving from one another over time. There are many\nother types of classificatory principles \u2013 sorting correspondence by date\nreceived (temporal order), for example, or recipes by those most frequently\nused (functional order).</li>\n\n<li>\n<i>The categories are mutually exclusive</i>. In an ideal world, categories\nare clearly demarcated bins, into which any object addressed by the system\nwill neatly and uniquely fit. So in the family genealogy, one mother and\none father give birth to a child, forever and uniquely attributed to them\nas parents - there are no surrogate mothers, or issues of shared custody\nor of retrospective DNA testing. A rose is a rose, not a rose sometimes\nand a daisy other times.</li>\n\n<li>\n<i>The system is complete</i>. With respect to the items, actions or areas\nunder its consideration, the ideal classification system provides total\ncoverage of the world it describes. So, for example, a botanical classifier\nwould not simply ignore a newly discovered plant, but would always strive\nto name it. A physician using a diagnostic classification must enter <i>something\n</i>in\nthe patient\u2019s record where a category is called for; where unknown, the\npossibility exists of a medical discovery, to be absorbed into the complete\nsystem of classifying.</li>\n</ol>\nNo real-world working classification system that we have looked at meets\nthese \u2018simple\u2019 requirements and we doubt that any ever could. In the case\nof unique classificatory systems, people disagree about their nature; they\nignore or misunderstand them; or they routinely mix together different\nand contradictory principles. A library, for example, may have a consistent\nLibrary of Congress system in place, but supplement it in an <i>ad hoc</i>\nway. Best sellers to be rented out to patrons may find themselves on a\nseparate shelf; very rare, pornographic or expensive books may be locked\naway from general viewing at the discretion of the local librarian. Thus,\nthe books are moved, without being formally reclassified, yet carry an\nadditional functional system in their physical placement.\n<p>For the second point, mutual exclusivity may be impossible in practice,\nas when there is disagreement or ambivalence about the membership of an\nobject in a category. Medicine is replete with such examples, especially\nwhen the disease entity is controversial or socially stigmatized. In terms\nof the third point, completeness, there may be good reasons to ignore data\nthat would make a system more comprehensive. The discovery of a new species\non an economically important development site may be silenced for monetary\nconsiderations. An anomaly may be acknowledged, but be too expensive \u2013\npolitically or bureaucratically -- to introduce into a system of record\nkeeping. In Chapter 2, we demonstrate ways of reading classification systems\nso as to be simultaneously sensitive to these conceptual, organizational\nand political dimensions.\n<p>Consider the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which will\nbe one of our major examples throughout this book. The full title of the\ncurrent (10th) edition of the ICD, is: \"ICD-10 - International Statistical\nClassification of Diseases and Related Health Problems; Tenth Revision.\"\nNote that it is designated a \u2018statistical\u2019 classification. By this is meant\nthat only diseases which are statistically significant are to be entered\nin (it is not an attempt to classify all disease).\n<p>The ICD calls itself a \u2018classification,\u2019 even though many have said\nthat it is a \u2018nomenclature\u2019 since it has no single classificatory principle\n(it has at least four; which are not mutually exclusive (this point is\ndeveloped in Chapter 4)). A nomenclature simply means an agreed-upon naming\nscheme, and need not follow any classificatory principles. The nomenclature\nof streets in Paris, for example, includes those named after intellectual\nfigures, plants and trees, battles, and politicians, as well as those inherited\nfrom former governments, such as Rue de Lut&egrave;ce (Lut&egrave;ce was\nthe ancient Roman name for Paris). There is no classificatory system. Nomenclature\nand classification are frequently confused, however, since often attempts\nare made to model nomenclature on a single, stable system of classification\nprinciples - as for example with botany (Bowker, in press) or anatomy.\nIn the case of the ICD, diagnostic nomenclature and the terms in the ICD\nitself were conflated in the American system of diagnosis-related groups\n(DRGs), much to the dismay of some medical researchers. In many cases the\nICD represents a compromise between conflicting schemes:\n<dir>\n<dir>The terms used in categories C82-C85 for non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas are\nthose of the Working Formulation, which attempted to find common ground\namong several major classification systems. The terms used in these schemes\nare not given in the Tabular List but appear in the Alphabetical Index;\nexact equivalence with the terms appearing in the Tabular List is not always\npossible. (ICD-10, 1: 215).</dir>\n</dir>\nHowever, the ICD presents itself clearly as a classification scheme and\nnot a nomenclature. Since 1970, there has been an effort underway by the\nWorld Health Organization to build a distinct International Nomenclature\nof Diseases (IND), whose main purpose will be to provide: \"a single recommended\nname for every disease entity\" (ICD-10, 1: 25).\n<p>For the purposes of this book, we take a broad enough definition so\nthat anything that is consistently called a classification system <i>and\ntreated as such </i>can be included in the term. This is a classic Pragmatist\nturn \u2013 things perceived as real are real in their consequences (Thomas\nand Thomas, 1917). If we took a purist or formalist view, the ICD would\nbe a (somewhat confused) nomenclature and who knows what the IND would\nrepresent. With a broad, Pragmatic definition we can look at the work that\nis involved in building and maintaining a family of entities that people\ncall classification systems - rather than attempt the Herculean, Sisyphian\ntask of purifying the (un)stable systems in place. Howard Becker makes\na cognate point here:\n<dir>\n<dir>Epistemology has been a ... negative discipline, mostly devoted to\nsaying what you shouldn\u2019t do if you want your activity to merit the title\nof science, and to keeping unworthy pretenders from successfully appropriating\nit. The sociology of science, the empirical descendant of epistemology,\ngives up trying to decide what should and shouldn\u2019t count as science, and\ntells what people who claim to be doing science do.<sup> </sup>(Becker,\n1996: 54-55).</dir>\n</dir>\nThe work of making, maintaining, and analyzing classification systems is\nrichly textured. It is one of the central kinds of work of modernity, including\nscience and medicine. It is, we argue, central to social life.\n<p><b>Standards</b>\n<p>Classifications and standards are closely related, but not identical.\nWhile this book focuses on classification, standards are crucial components\nof the larger argument. The systems we discuss often do become standardized;\nin addition, a standard is in part a way of classifying the world. What\nthen are standards? The term as we use it in the book has several dimensions:\n<ol>\n<li>\nA \u2018standard\u2019 is any set of agreed-upon rules for the production of (textual\nor material) objects.</li>\n\n<li>\nA standard spans more than one community of practice (or site of activity).\nIt has temporal reach as well, in that it persists over time.</li>\n\n<li>\nStandards are deployed in making things work together over distance and\nheterogeneous metrics. For example, computer protocols for Internet communication\ninvolve a cascade of standards (cf. Abbate and Kahin, 1995) which need\nto work together well in order for the average user to gain seamless access\nto the web of information. There are standards for the components to link\nfrom your computer to the phone network, for coding and decoding binary\nstreams as sound, for sending messages from one network to another, for\nattaching documents to messages, and so forth.</li>\n\n<li>\nLegal bodies often enforce standards - be these professional organizations,\nmanufacturers\u2019 organizations or the State. We might say tomorrow that volap&uuml;k\n(a universal language that boasted some 23 journals in 1889<sup> </sup>(Proust,\n1989: 580)) or its successor Esperanto shall henceforth be the standard\nlanguage for international diplomacy. Without a mechanism of enforcement,\nor a grassroots movement, we shall fail.</li>\n\n<li>\nThere is no natural law that the best standard shall win - QWERTY, Lotus\n123, DOS and VHS are often cited in this context. The standards that do\nwin may do so for a variety of other reasons: they build on an installed\nbase, they had better marketing at the outset, and they were used by a\ncommunity of gatekeepers who favored their use. Sometimes standards win\ndue to an outright conspiracy, as in the case of the gas refrigerator documented\nby Cowan (1985).</li>\n\n<li>\nStandards have significant inertia, and can be very difficult and expensive\nto change.</li>\n</ol>\nIt was possible to build a cathedral like Chartres without standard representations\n(blueprints) and standard building materials (regular sizes for stones,\ntools etc.) (Turnbull, 1993). People invented an amazing array of analog\nmeasuring devices (such as string lengths). Each cathedral town posted\nthe local analog metric (a length of metal) at its gates, so that peripatetic\nmaster builders could calibrate their work to it when they arrived in the\ntown. They did not have a wide-scale measurement system such as our modern\nmetric or decimal systems. (Whether as a result of this local improvisation\nor not, Turnbull notes, many cathedrals did fall down!)\n<p>It is no longer possible to build a complex collective project without\nstandardized measurements. Consider a modern housing development; too much\nneeds to come together from distant and proximate sources - electricity,\ngas, sewer, timber sizes, screws, nails and so on. The control of standards\nis a central, often underanalyzed feature of economic life (but see the\nwork of Paul David - for example David and Rothwell, 1994 - for a rich\ntreatment). They are key to knowledge production as well - Latour (1987)\nspeculates that far more economic resources are spent creating and maintaining\nstandards than in producing \u2018pure\u2019 science. There are a number of histories\nof standards which point to the development and maintenance of standards\nas being critical to industrial production.\n<p>At the same time, just as with classifications, these dimensions of\nstandards are in some sense idealized. They embody goals of practice and\nproduction that are never perfectly realized \u2013 like Plato\u2019s triangles.\nThe process of building to a standardized code, for example, usually includes\na face-to-face negotiation between builder(s) and inspector(s), which itself\nincludes a history of relations between those people. Small deviations\nare routinely overlooked, unless the inspector is making a political point.\nThe idiom \"good enough for government use\" embodies the common sense accommodations\nof the slip between the ideal standard and the contingencies of practice.\n<p>In this and in many other ways, then, classifications and standards\nare two sides of the same coin. Classifications may or may not become standardized.\nIf they do not, they are <i>ad hoc</i>, limited to an individual or a local\ncommunity, and/or of limited duration. At the same time, every successful\nstandard imposes a classification system, at the very least between good\nand bad ways of organizing actions or things. And the workarounds involved\nin the practical use of standards frequently entail the use of ad hoc non-standard\ncategories. For example, a patient may respond to a standardized protocol\nfor the management of chronic back pain by approximating the directions\nand supplementing them with an idiosyncratic or alternative medical classification\nscheme. If the protocol requires a number of exercises done three times\na day, the patient may distinguish good days from bad days, vacation days\nfrom working days, and only do the exercises when they deem them necessary.\n<p>Classifications and standards are related in another sense, which concerns\nthe use of a classification by more than one social world or community\nof practice, and the impact that use has on questions of membership and\nthe taken-for-grantedness of objects. Throughout this book, we speak of\nclassifications as objects for cooperation across social worlds, or as\nboundary objects (Star and Griesemer, 1989). Drawing from earlier studies\nof interdisciplinary scientific cooperation, we define boundary objects\nas those objects that both inhabit several communities of practice <u>and</u>\nsatisfy the informational requirements of each of them. In working practice,\nthey are objects that are able both to travel across borders and maintain\nsome sort of constant identity. They can be tailored to meet the needs\nof any one community (they are plastic in this sense, or customizable).\nAt the same time, they have common identities across settings. This is\nachieved by allowing the objects to be weakly structured in common use,\nimposing stronger structures in the individual-site tailored use. They\nare thus both ambiguous and constant; they may be abstract or concrete.\nIn Chapter 9, we explore in detail the abstract ramifications of the use\nof classifications by more than one community and the connection with the\nemergence of standards.\n<p><b>The Structure of this Book</b>\n<p>In order to explore these questions, we have written a first chapter\ndetailing some key themes of the work to follow. We have then divided the\nmiddle of the book into three parts, which look at several classification\nsystems. We have structured these studies around three issues in turn:\nclassification and large-scale infrastructures (Part 1); classification\nand biography (Part 2) and classification and work practice (Part 3). Weaving\nthese three themes in combination, we can explore the texture of the space\nwithin which infrastructures work and classification systems from different\nworlds meet, adjust, fracture or merge. In two concluding chapters, we\nelaborate some theoretical conclusions from these studies.\n<p><u>Part 1: Classification and Large-Scale Infrastructures</u>\n<p>Classification systems are integral to any working infrastructure. In\nPart 1 (Chapters 2-4) we examine how a global medical classification system\nwas developed to serve the conflicting needs of multiple local, national\nand international information systems.\n<p>Our investigation here begins in the late nineteenth century, with another\nkind of information explosion \u2013 the development of myriad systems of classification\nand standardization of modern industrial and scientific institutions.\n<p>In the nineteenth century people learned to look at themselves as surrounded\nby tiny, invisible things which have the power of life or death: microbes\nand bacteria. They learned to teach their children to wash their hands\nof germs before eating, and later, to apply antiseptic salve to a cat scratch\nor an inflamed fingernail. Company washrooms sprouted signs admonishing\nemployees to wash hands before returning to work, especially if they worked\nwith food served to others. In this period, people also learned how to\nperform surgery that would not usually be fatal and how to link gum disease\nwith bacteria between the teeth.\n<p>At the same time as they learned these practices with respect to germs,\nanother ubiquitous set of tiny, invisible things were being negotiated\nand sewn into the social fabric. These were formal, commodified classifications\nand standards, both scientific and commercial. People classified, measured\nand standardized just about everything -- animals, human races, books,\npharmaceutical products, taxes, jobs, and diseases. The categories so produced\nlived in industry, medicine, science, education and government. They ranged\nfrom the measurement of machine tools to the measurement of people\u2019s forearms\nand foreheads. The standards were sometimes physically tiny measures --\nhow big should be a standard size second of time, or an eyeglass screw\nor an electrical pulse rate? At other times, they were larger: what size\nshould a railroad car be, or a city street \u2013 or a corporation? Government\nagencies, industrial consortia, and scientific committees created the standards\nand category systems. So did mail order firms, machine tool manufacturers,\nand animal breeders, and thousands of other actors. Most of these activities\nbecame silently embodied in the built environment and in notions of good\npractice. The decisions taken in the course of their construction are forever\nlost to the historical record. In fact, their history is considered by\nmost to be boring, trivial, and unworthy of investigation.\n<p>There are some striking similarities to our own late 20<sup>th</sup>\ncentury historical moment in that faced by Europeans at the end of the\n19<sup>th</sup> century. A new international information-sharing and gathering\nmovement was starting, thanks to the advent of wide-scale international\ntravel, international quasi-governmental governance structures, and a growing\nawareness that many phenomena (like epidemics and markets) would not be\nconfined to one country. In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, people faced for\nthe first time large numbers of bodies and their microbes moving rapidly\nacross national borders and between large bureaucracies -- and at an unprecedented\nrate. Especially in the case of epidemics, international public health\nbecame an urgent necessity. Attempts to control these passengers represent\none of the first large-scale Western medical classification schemes: ships\nwho had called at ports on the way back from Mecca had to follow a period\nof quarantine during which anyone infected would become symptomatic --\nthus emulating the slower timeline of horse or camel travel.\n<p>Figure 1. Map of Cholera Epidemics. Source: A. Proust, 1892.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>After quarantine, one was given a \u2018clean bill of health\u2019 and allowed\nfreedom of transport. This was a costly delay for the ships. And so, of\ncourse, a black market in clean bills of health appeared shortly thereafter\n... . The problem of tracking who was dying of what, where on earth became\na permanent feature of international bureaucracy.\n<p>Figure 2. French Bill of Health. Source: A. Proust, 1892.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p><img SRC=\"fig1.JPG\" height=728 width=434></center>\n\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Constructing such a list may seem to us like a comparatively straightforward\ntask, once the mechanisms for reporting were in place. However, for over\none hundred years there has <i>never been consensus</i> about disease categories\nor about the process of collecting data. So one culture sees spirit possession\nas a valid cause of death, another ridicules this as superstition; one\nmedical specialty sees cancer as a localized phenomenon to be cut out and\nstopped from spreading, another sees it as a disorder of the whole immune\nsystem which merely manifests in one location or another. The implications\nfor both treatment and classification differ. Trying to encode both causes\nresults in serious information retrieval problems.\n<p>In addition, classifications shift historically. In Britain in 1650\nwe find that 696 people died of being \u2018aged\u2019; 31 succumbed to wolves 9\nto grief and 19 to \u2018King\u2019s Evil\u2019. \"Mother\" claimed 2 in 1647 but none in\n1650, but in that year 2 were \u2018smothered and stifled.\u2019 Seven starved in\n1650 (Graunt, 1662), but by 1930 the World Health Organization would make\na distinction: if an adult starved to death it was a misfortune; if a child\nstarved, it was homicide. Death by wolf alone becomes impossible by 1948,\nwhere death from animals is divided between venomous and non-venomous,\nand only dogs and rats are singled out for categories of their own (ICD\n5, 1948, p. 267).\n<p>Insert Figure 3. Mortality Table, England in Seventeenth Century. Source:\nJ. Graunt, 1662.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>The first part of this book is dedicated to understanding the construction\nof the International Classification of Diseases (ICD): a classification\nscheme with its origins in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century but still present\ntoday \u2013 indeed it is ubiquitous in medical bureaucracy and medical information\nsystems. The ICD constitutes an impressive attempt to coordinate information\nand resources about mortality and morbidity globally. For the background\nresearch for understanding international processes of classification, we\nwent to Geneva and studied the archives of the World Health Organization\nand its predecessors such as the League of Nations and the Office Internationale\nd\u2019Hygi&egrave;ne Publique. Roughly every ten years since the 1890s, the\nICD has been revised. The UN and the WHO have kept some records of the\nprocess of revision; others are to be found in the file cabinets of individuals\ninvolved in the revision process.\n<p>What we found was not a record of gradually increasing consensus, but\na panoply of tangled and crisscrossing classification schemes, held together\nby an increasingly harassed and sprawling international public health bureaucracy.\nSpirit possession and superstition never do reconcile, but in order that\nsome data be entered on the Western-oriented death certificate, it becomes\npossible from the WHO point of view for a death to be assigned the category\n\u2018non-existent disease\u2019.\n<p>One of the other major influences on keeping medical records has been\ninsurance companies, as we discuss in Chapter 4. As the working lives of\nindividuals became more closely tied up with the state and its occupational\nhealth concerns, the classification of work-related diseases (including\nindustrial accidents) became very important. Life expectancy measures were\nequally important, both in terms of estimating the available labor force\nand for basic planning measures. Of course, occupational and non-work related\nmedical classifications did not always line up: companies might have been\nreluctant to take responsibility for unsafe working conditions, latency\nin conditions such as asbestosis makes data hard to come by; there may\nhave been moral conflicts about the cause of such illnesses.\n<p>In similar fashion, any classification that touched on religious or\nethical questions (and surprisingly many do so) would be disputed. If life\nbegins at the moment of conception, abortion is murder and a fetus dead\nat 3 months is a stillbirth, encoded as a live infant death. Contemporary\nabortion wars in the U.S. and Western Europe attest to the enduring and\nirreconcilable ontologies involved in these codifications.\n<p>For a bureaucracy to establish a smooth data collection effort, a means\nmust be found to detour around such higher-order issues. The statistical\ncommittee discussed in Chapter 4, assigned with determining the exact moment\nof the beginning of life by number of attempted breaths and weight of fetus\nor infant, cuts a Solomon-like figure against such a disputed landscape.\nAt the same time, there is an element of reductionist absurdity here \u2013\nhow many breaths equals \u2018life\u2019? If not specified, another source of quality\ncontrol for data is lost; if specified, it seems to make common sense ironic.\nThis is an issue we will revisit as well in the discussion of nursing interventions,\nChapter 7.\n<p>Algorithms for codification do not resolve the moral questions involved,\nalthough they may obscure them. For decades, priests, feminists and medical\nethicists on both sides have debated the question of when a human life\nbegins. The moral questions involved in encoding such information \u2013 and\nthe politics of certainty and of voice involved \u2013 are much more obscure.\n<p>Forms like the death certificate, when aggregated, form a case of what\nKirk and Kutchins call \"the substitution of precision for validity\" (1992;\nsee also Star, 1989b). That is, when a seemingly neutral data collection\nmechanism is substituted for ethical conflict about the contents of the\nforms, the moral debate is partially erased. One may get ever more precise\nknowledge, without having resolved deeper questions, and indeed, by burying\nthem.\n<p>There is no simple pluralistic answer to how such questions may be resolved\ndemocratically or with due process. Making all knowledge retrievable, and\nthus re-debatable, is an appealing solution in a sense from a purely information\nscientific point of view. However, from a practical organizational viewpoint\nthis fails. For example, in 1927, a manual describing simultaneous causes\nof death listed some 8,300 terms, which represented 34 million possible\ncombinations that might appear on the face of a death certificate. A complete\nuser manual for filling out the certificate would involve 61 volumes of\n1,000 pages each. This is clearly not a pragmatic choice for conducting\na task which most physicians also find boring, low-status, and clinically\nunimportant.\n<p>As we know from studies of work of all sorts, people do not do the ideal\njob, but the doable job. When faced with too many alternatives and too\nmuch information, they satisfice (March and Simon, 1958). As an indicator\nof this, studies of the validity of codes on death certificates repeatedly\nshow that doctors have favorite categories; these are regionally biased;\nand autopsies (which are rarely done anyway) have a low rate of agreement\nwith the code on the form (Fagot-Largeault, 1989).\n<p>Even when there is relatively simple consensus about the cause of death,\nthe act of assigning a classification can be socially or ethically charged.\nThus, in some countries the death certificate has two faces: a public certificate\nwhich is handed to the funeral director in order that arrangements be made\nquickly and discreetly, and a statistical cause which is filed anonymously\nwith the public health department. In this case, the doctor is not faced\nwith telling the family of a socially unacceptable form of death: syphilis\ncan become heart failure, or suicide can become a stroke. For example,\nas we discuss in Chapter 4, the process of moving to an anonymous statistical\nrecord may reveal hidden biases in the reporting of death. Where the death\ncertificate is public, stigma and the desire to protect the feelings of\nthe family may reign over scientific accuracy.\n<p>Over the years, those designing the list of causes of death and disease\nhave struggled with all of these problems. One of the simple but important\nrules of thumb to try to control for this degree of uncertainty is to distribute\nthe residual categories. \"Not elsewhere classified\" appears throughout\nthe entire ICD, but nowhere as a top-level category. So since uncertainty\nis inevitable, and its scope and scale essentially unknowable, at least\nits impact will not hit a single disease or location disproportionately.\nIts effects will remain as local as possible; the quest for certainty is\nnot lost, but postponed, diluted, and abridged.\n<p>With the rise of very-large scale information systems, the Internet,\nthe World Wide Web, and digital libraries, we find that the sorts of uncertainties\nfaced by the WHO are themselves endemic in our own lives. When we use email\nfilters, for example, we risk losing the information that doesn\u2019t fit the\nsender\u2019s category: junk email is very hard to sort out automatically in\na reliable way. If we have too many detailed filters, we lose the efficiency\nsought from the filter in the first place. As we move into desktop use\nof hyperlinked digital libraries, we fracture the traditional bibliographic\ncategories across media, versions, genres, and author. The freedom entailed\nis that we can customize our own library spaces; but as Jo Freeman (1972)\npointed out in her classic article, \u2018The Tyranny of Structurelessness,\u2019\nthis is also so much more work that we may fall into a lowest-level convenience\nclassification rather than a high-level semantic one. In one of our digital\nlibrary projects at Illinois, for example, several undergraduates we interviewed\nin focus groups stated that they would just get five references for a term\npaper -- any five -- since that\u2019s what the professor wanted, and they\u2019d\nbetter be ones that are listed electronically and available without walking\nacross campus.\n<p>The ICD classification is in many ways an ideal mirror of how people\ndesigning global information schemes struggle with uncertainty, ambiguity,\nstandardization, and the practicalities of data quality. Digging into the\narchives, and reading the ICD closely through its changes, reveals some\nof the upstream, design-oriented decisions informing the negotiated order\nachieved by the vast system of forms, boxes, software, and death certificates.\nAt the same time, we have been constantly aware of the human suffering\noften occasioned by the apparently bloodless apparatus of paperwork through\nwhich these data are collected.\n<p><u>Part 2: Classification and Biography</u>\n<p>Our second section of this book looks at two cases where the lives of\nindividuals are broken, twisted, and torqued by their encounters with classification\nsystems. This often-invisible anguish informs another level of ethical\ninquiry. Once having been made, the classification systems are applied\nto individual cases \u2013 sometimes resulting in a kind of surreal bureaucratic\nlandscape. Sociologist Max Weber spoke of the \"iron cage of bureaucracy\"\nhemming in the lives of modern workers and families. The cage formed by\nclassification systems can be constraining in just this way \u2013 although\ncage might be too impoverished a metaphor to describe its variations and\noccasional stretches. In Chapters 5 and 6, we look at biography and classification.\nWe chose two examples where classification has become a direct tool mediating\nhuman suffering. Our first case concerns tuberculosis patients, and the\nimpact of disease classification on their lives. We use historical data\nto discuss the experience of the disease within the tuberculosis asylum.\n<p>Tuberculosis patients, like many with chronic illness, live under a\nconfusing regime of categories and metrics (see also Ziporyn, 1992). Many\npeople were incarcerated for years \u2013 some for decades \u2013 waiting for the\ndisease to run its course, to achieve a cure at high altitudes, or to die\nthere. They were subjected to a constant battery of measurements: lung\ncapacity, auscultation, body temperature and pulse rate, X-rays, and, as\nthey were developed, laboratory tests of blood and other bodily fluids.\nThe results of the tests determined the degree of freedom from the sanatorium\nregime, as well as, ultimately, the date of release.\n<p>As will be no surprise to medical sociologists, the interpretation and\nnegotiations of the tests between doctor and patient were fraught with\nquestions of the social value of the patient (middle class patients being\nthought more compliant and reliable when on furlough from the asylumthan\nthose from lower classes); with gender stereotypes; and with the gradual\nadaptation of the patient\u2019s biographical expectations to the period of\nincarceration. Thomas Mann\u2019s <i>The Magic Mountain</i> and Julius Roth\u2019s\n<i>Timetables\n</i>are\nfull of stories of classification and metrication. We examine how different\ntimelines, and expectations about those timelines, unfold in the two remarkable\nvolumes. Biography, career, the state of the medical art with respect to\nthe disease, and the public health adjudication of tuberculosis are all\nintertwined against the landscape of the sanatorium.\n<p>Life in the sanatorium has a surreal, almost nightmarish quality, as\ndetailed by Mann, Roth and many other writers throughout the twentieth\ncentury. This sense comes precisely from the misalignment between a patient\u2019s\nlife expectations, the uncertainties of the disease and of the treatment,\nand the negotiations laden with other sorts of interactional burdens. It\nis one thing to be ill and in the hospital, with an indefinite release\ndate. It is another when the date of release includes one\u2019s ability to\nnegotiate well with the physicians, their interpretation of the latest\nresearch, and the exigencies of public health forms and red tape. We call\nthis agglomeration <i>torque</i>, a twisting of timelines that pull at\neach other, and bend or twist both patient biography and the process of\nmetrication. When all are aligned, there is no sense of torque or stress;\nwhen they pull against each other over a long period, a nightmare texture\nemerges.\n<p>A similar torque is found in our second case in this section, that of\nrace classification and reclassification under apartheid in South Africa.\nBetween 1950 and the fall of apartheid forty years later, South Africans\nwere ruled under an extremely rigid, comprehensive system of race classification.\nDivided into four main \u2018racial\u2019 groups (White/European, Bantu (Black),\nAsian and Colored (Mixed Race)), people\u2019s lives were rigidly segregated.\nThe segregation extended from so-called petty apartheid (separate bus stops,\nwater fountains and toilets) to rights of work, residency, education and\nfreedom of movement. This system became the target of worldwide protest,\nand eventually came to a formal end. These facts are common knowledge.\nWhat has been less well documented or publicized are the actual techniques\nused to classify people by race. In Chapter 6, we examine in detail some\ncases of mixed-race people who applied to be re-classified after their\ninitial racial designation by the state. These borderline cases serve to\nilluminate the underlying architecture of apartheid. This was a mixture\nof brute power, confused eugenics and appropriations of anthropological\ntheories of race. The scientific reason given for apartheid by the white\nsupremacist Nationalist Party was \u2018separate development\u2019 \u2013 the idea that\nin order to develop naturally, the races must develop separately.\n<p>In pursuing this ideology, of course, people and families that crossed\nthe color barrier were problematic. If a natural scientific explanation\nwas given for apartheid, systematic means should be available to winnow\nwhite from black, colored from black and so on. As the chapter delineates,\nthis attempt was fraught with inconsistencies and local work-arounds, as\npeople never easily fit any categories. Over 100,000 people made formal\nappeals concerning their race classification; most were denied.\n<p>Although it lies at a political extreme, these cases form a continuum\nwith the classification of people at different stages of tuberculosis.\nIn both cases, biographies and categories fall along often-conflicting\ntrajectories. Lives are twisted, even torn, in the attempt to force the\none into the other. These torques may be petty or grand, but they are a\nway of understanding the co-construction of lives and their categories.\n<p><u>Part 3: Classification and Work Practice</u>\n<p>In Part 3, Chapters 7 and 8, we will look at how classification systems\norganize and are organized by work practice. We will look at the effort\nof a group of nursing scientists based at the University of Iowa and led\nby Joanne McCloskey and Gloria Bulechek to produce a classification of\nnursing interventions. Their Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC)\naims to depict the range of activities that nurses carry out in their daily\nroutines. Their original system consisted of a list of some 336 interventions;\neach comprised of a label, a definition, a set of activities, and a short\nlist of background readings. Each of those interventions is in turn classified\nwithin a taxonomy of six domains and 26 classes. For example, one of the\ntasks nurses commonly perform is preparing and monitoring intravenous medication.\nThe nursing intervention \"Epidural Analgesia Administration\" is defined\nas: \"preparation and delivery of narcotic analgesics into the epidural\nspace\"; another common one, \"Cough Enhancement\", groups activities designed\nto help respiration.\n<p>The Iowa NIC researchers built up their system of nursing interventions\ninductively. They created a preliminary list that distinguished between\nnursing interventions and activities, then nurtured a large grassroots\nnetwork of nursing researchers. This group narrowed the preliminary list\nof interventions to the original 336 published in Nursing Interventions\nClassification, and further validated them via surveys and focus groups.\nDifferent interventions were reviewed for clinical relevance, and a coding\nscheme was developed. The classification system grew through a cooperative\nprocess, with nurses in field sites trying out categories, and suggesting\nnew ones in a series of regional and specialist meetings. Since 1992, the\nnurses have added over 50 interventions to their original list. We attended\na number of these meetings, and interviewed many of the nurses involved.\n<p>Caring work such as calming and educating patients, usually done by\nnurses, often cuts across specific medical diagnostic categories. The NIC\ninvestigators use their list of interventions in order to make visible\nand legitimate the work that nurses do. The idea is that it will be used\nto compare work across hospitals, specialties and geographical areas, and\nto build objective research measures for the outcomes. NIC, although still\nrelatively young, promises to be a major rallying point for nurses in the\ndecades to come. Before NIC, much nursing work was invisible to the medical\nrecord. As one nurse poignantly said, \"we were just thrown in with the\ncost of the room.\" Another said, \"I am not a bed!\" The traditional, quintessential\nnurse would be ever present, caregiving, and helpful -- but not a part\nof the formal patient-doctor information structure. Of course, this invisibility\nis bound up with traditional gender roles, as with librarians, social workers\nand primary school teachers.\n<p>But as with the ICD, classifying events is difficult. In the case of\nNIC, the politics move from a politics of certainty to a politics of ambiguity.\nThe essence of this politics is walking a tightrope between increased visibility\nand increased surveillance; between over-specifying what a nurse <i>should</i>\ndo and taking away discretion from the individual practitioner.\n<p>When discretion and the tacit knowledge that is part of every occupation\nmeet the medical bureaucracy which would account for every pill and every\nmoment of health care workers\u2019 time, contradictions ensue. This is especially\ntrue in the \"softer\" areas of care. Social-psychological caregiving is\nalso one of the areas where this dilemma is prominent. For example, NIC\nlists as nursing interventions \"anticipatory guidance\" and \"mood management\"\n-- preparation for grief, or surgery. Difficult though these are to capture\nin a classification scheme, one much more difficult is \"humor.\" How can\none capture humor as a deliberate nursing intervention? Does sarcasm, irony,\nor laughter count as a nursing intervention? When do you stop? How to reimburse\nhumor, how to measure this kind of care? No one would dispute its importance,\nbut it is by its nature a situated and subjective action. A grey area of\ncommon sense remains for the individual staff nurse to define whether some\nof the nursing interventions are worth classifying.\n<p>There are continuing tensions within NIC between just this kind of common\nsense, and abstracting away from the local in order to standardize and\ncompare, while at the same time rendering invisible work visible. Nurses\u2019\nwork is often invisible for a combination of good and bad reasons. Nurses\nhave to ask mundane questions, rearrange bedcovers, move a patient\u2019s hand\nso that it is closer to a button, and sympathize about the suffering involved\nin illness. Bringing this work out into the open and differentiating its\ncomponents can mean belaboring the obvious or risking being too vague.\n<p>One of the battlefields where comparability and control appear as opposing\nfactors is in linking NIC to costing. NIC researchers assert that the classification\nof nursing interventions will allow a determination of the costs of services\nprovided by nurses and planning for resources needed in nursing practice.\nAs the nurse above says, nursing treatments are usually bundled in with\nthe room price. NIC is used in the development of nursing health care systems\nand may provide a planning vehicle for previously untracked costs. As we\nshall see, NIC can also be problematic for nurses. Like any other classification\nscheme which renders work visible, it can also render surveillance easier\n\u2013 and could in the end lead to a Tayloristic dissection of the tasks of\nnursing (as the NIC designers are well aware). So-called unskilled tasks\nmay be taken out of their hands and the profession as a whole may suffer\na loss of autonomy and the substitution of rigid procedure for common sense.\n<p>As in the case of the ICD, there are many layers of meaning involved\nin developing and implementing nursing classification. NIC might look like\na straightforward organizational tool: it is in fact much more than that.\nIt merges science, practice, bureaucracy and information systems. NIC coordinates\nbodies, impairments, charts, reimbursement systems, vocabularies, patients,\nand health care professionals. Ultimately, it provides a manifesto for\nnursing as an organized occupation, a basis for a scientific domain and\na tool for organizing work practices.\n<p><b>Why it is important to study classification systems</b>\n<p>The sheer density of the collisions of classification schemes in our\nlives calls for a new kind of science, a new set of metaphors, linking\ntraditional social science and computer and information science. We need\na topography of things such as the distribution of ambiguity; the fluid\ndynamics of how classification systems meet up \u2013 a plate tectonics rather\nthan static geology. This new science will draw on the best empirical studies\nof workarounds, information use, and mundane tools such as desktop folders\nand file cabinets (perhaps peering backwards out from the web and into\nthe practices). It will also use the best of object-oriented programming\nand other areas of computer science to describe this territory. It will\nbuild on years of valuable research on classification in library and information\nscience.\n<p>Let us finish this introduction with a future scenario that symbolizes\nthis abstract endeavor. Imagine that you\u2019re walking through a forest of\ninter-articulated branches. Some are covered with ice or snow, and the\nsun melts their touching tips to reveal space between. Some are so thickly\nbrambled they seem solid. Others are oddly angular in nature, like esplanaded\ntrees.\n<p>Some of the trees are wild, some have been cultivated. Some are old\nand gnarled, and some are tiny shoots; some of the old ones are nearly\ndead, others show green leaves. The forest is still wild, but there are\nsome parks, and some protocols for finding one\u2019s way along, at least on\nthe known paths. Helicopters flying overhead can quickly tell you how many\ntypes of each tree, even each leaf, there are in the world, but they cannot\nyet give you a guidebook for birdwatching or forestry management. There\nis a lot of underbrush and a complex ecology of soil bacteria, flora and\nfauna.\n<p>Now imagine that the forest is a huge information space, and each of\nthe trees and bushes are classification systems. Those who make them up\nand use them are the animals and plants, and the soil is a mix of the Internet,\nthe paper world, and other communication infrastructures.\n<p>Your job is to describe this forest. You may write a basic manual of\nforestry, or paint a landscape, compose an opera, or improve the maps throughout.\nWhat will your product look like? Who will use it?\n<p>In this book, we show from our studies of medical, scientific and race\nclassification that, like a good forest, some areas will be left wild,\nor in darkness, or even unmapped (that is, some ambiguity will remain).\nWe will show that abstract schema that do not take <i>use</i> into account\n-- say, maps that leave out landmarks or altitude or how readers use maps\n-- will simply fail. (That is, common sense will be seen as the precious\nresource that it is.) We intuit that a mixture of scientific, poetic, and\nartistic talents, such as that represented in the hypertextual world, will\nbe crucial to this task. We will demonstrate the value of a mixture of\nformal and folk classifications, used sensibly in the context of people\u2019s\nlives.\n<p><b>Chapter One: Some Tricks of the Trade in Analyzing Classification</b>\n<dir>\n<dir><i><font face=\"New York,Times New Roman\">My guess is that we have\na folk theory of categorization itself. It says that things come in well-defined\nkinds, that the kinds are characterized by shared properties, and that\nthere is one right taxonomy of the kinds.</font></i>\n<p><i><font face=\"New York,Times New Roman\">It is easier to show what is\nwrong with a scientific theory than with a folk theory. A folk theory defines\ncommon sense itself. When the folk theory and the technical theory converge,\nit gets even tougher to see where that theory gets in the way \u2013 or even\nthat it is a theory at all (Lakoff, 1987: 121).</font></i></dir>\n</dir>\nInformation infrastructure is a tricky thing to analyze.&nbsp; Really good,\nusable systems disappear, almost by definition. The easier they are to\nuse, the harder they are to see. As well, most of the time, the bigger\nthey are, the harder they are to see. Unless we are electricians or building\ninspectors, we rarely think about the myriad of databases, standards, and\ninstruction manuals subtending our reading lamps, much less about the politics\nof the electric grid that they tap into. And so on, as many layers of technology\naccrue and expand over space and time. Systems of classification (and of\nstandardization) form a juncture of social organization, moral order, and\nlayers of technical integration.&nbsp; Each sub-system inherits, increasingly\nas it scales up, the inertia of the installed base of systems that have\ncome before.\n<p>Infrastructures are never transparent for everyone, and their workability\nas they scale up becomes increasingly complex.&nbsp; Through due methodological\nattention to the architecture and use of these systems, we can achieve\na deeper understanding of how it is that individuals (and communities)\nmeet infrastructure.&nbsp; We know that this means, at the least, an understanding\nof infrastructure that includes:\n<ul>\n<li>\na historical process of development of many tools, arranged for a wide\nvariety of users, and made to work in concert;</li>\n\n<li>\na practical match between routines of work practice, technology, and wider-scale\norganizational and technical resources;</li>\n\n<li>\na rich set of negotiated compromises ranging from epistemology to data\nentry which are both available and transparent to communities of users;</li>\n\n<li>\na negotiated order in which all of the above, recursively, can function\ntogether.</li>\n</ul>\nThe following shows a more elaborate definition of infrastructure, following\nStar and Ruhleder (1996), who emphasize that one person\u2019s infrastructure\nmay be another\u2019s barrier:\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b>Figure 4 Star and Ruhleder\u2019s Definition of Infrastructure</b>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Embeddedness</i>. Infrastructure is sunk into, inside of, other structures,\nsocial arrangements and technologies;</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Transparency</i>. Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense\nthat it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each\ntask, but invisibly supports those tasks;</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Reach or scope</i>. This may be either spatial or temporal -- infrastructure\nhas reach beyond a single event or one-site practice;</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Learned as part of membership</i>. The taken-for-grantedness of artifacts\nand organizational arrangements is a <i>sine qua non</i> of membership\nin a community of practice (Lave and Wenger, 1991; Star, 1996). Strangers\nand outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned\nabout. New participants acquire a naturalized familiarity with its objects\nas they become members;</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Links with conventions of practice</i>. Infrastructure both shapes and\nis shaped by the conventions of a community of practice, e.g. the ways\nthat cycles of day-night work are affected by and affect electrical power\nrates and needs. Generations of typists have learned the QWERTY keyboard;\nits limitations are inherited by the computer keyboard and thence by the\ndesign of today\u2019s computer furniture (Becker, 1982);</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Embodiment of standards</i>. Modified by scope and often by conflicting\nconventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other\ninfrastructures and tools in a standardized fashion.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Built on an installed base</i>. Infrastructure does not grow <i>de novo</i>;\nit wrestles with the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths\nand limitations from that base. Optical fibers run along old railroad lines;\nnew systems are designed for backward-compatibility; and failing to account\nfor these constraints may be fatal or distorting to new development processes\n(Monteiro and Hanseth, 1996).</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Becomes visible upon breakdown.</i> The normally invisible quality of\nworking infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down,\nthe bridge washes out, there is a power blackout. Even when there are back-up\nmechanisms or procedures, their existence further highlights the now-visible\ninfrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally.</i> Because\ninfrastructure is big, layered and complex, and because it means different\nthings locally, it is never changed from above. Changes take time and negotiation,\nand adjustment with other aspects of the systems involved.</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\nThis chapter offers four themes, methodological points of departure for\nthe analysis of these complex relationships. Each theme operates as a gestalt\nswitch - it comes in the form of an <i>infrastructural inversion</i> (Bowker,\n1994). This inversion is a struggle against the tendency of infrastructure\nto disappear (except when breaking down). It means learning to look closely\nat technologies and arrangements which, by design and by habit, tend to\nfade into the woodwork (sometimes literally!).\n<p>Infrastructural inversion means recognizing the depths of interdependence\nof technical networks and standards, on the one hand, and the real work\nof politics and knowledge production on the other. It foregrounds these\nnormally invisible Lilliputian threads, and furthermore gives them causal\nprominence in many areas normally attributed to heroic actors, social movements,\nor cultural mores. The inversion is similar to the argument made by Becker\n(1982) in his book <i>Art Worlds. </i>Most history and social analysis\nof art has neglected the details of infrastructure within which communities\nof artistic practice emerge. Becker\u2019s inversion examines the conventions\nand constraints of the material artistic infrastructure, and its ramifications.\nFor example, the convention of musical concerts lasting about three hours\nramifies throughout the producing organization. Parking attendants, unions,\nticket takers, and theater rentals are arranged in cascading dependence\non this interval of time. An eight-hour musical piece, which is occasionally\nwritten, means rearranging all of these expectations \u2013 which in turn is\nso expensive that such productions are rare. Or paintings are about the\nsize, usually, that will hang comfortably on a wall. They are also the\nsize that fits rolls of canvas, the skills of framers, and the very doorways\nof museums and galleries. These constraints are mutable only at great cost,\nand artists must always consider them before violating them.\n<p>Scientific inversions of infrastructure were the theme of a pathbreaking\nedited volume, <i>The Right Tools for the Job: At Work in Twentieth-Century\nLife Sciences</i> (Clarke and Fujimura, 1992). The purpose of this volume\nwas to tell the history of biology in a new way \u2013 from the point of view\nof the materials that constrain and enable biological researchers. Rats,\npetri dishes, taxidermy, planaria, drosophila and test tubes take center\nstage in this narrative. The standardization of genetic research on a few\nspecially-bred organisms (notably drosophila) has constrained the pacing\nof research, and the ways the questions may be framed, and has given biological\nsupply houses an important, invisible role in research horizons. While\nelephants or whales might answer different kinds of biological questions,\nthey are obviously unwieldy lab animals. While pregnant cow\u2019s urine played\na critical role in the discovery and isolation of reproductive hormones,\nno historian of biology had thought it important to describe the task of\nobtaining gallons of it on a regular basis. Adele Clarke (1998) puckishly\nrelates her discovery, in the memoirs of a biologist, of the technique\nrequired to do so: tickle the cow\u2019s labia in order to make her urinate.\nA starkly different view of the tasks of laboratory biology emerges from\nthis image. It must be added to the processes of stabling, feeding, impregnating,\nand caring for the cows involved. The supply chain, techniques and animal\nhandling methods had to be invented along with biology\u2019s conceptual frame;\nthey are not accidental, but constitutive.\n<p>Our infrastructural inversion with respect to information technologies\nand their attendant classification systems follows this line of analysis.\nLike the cow\u2019s urine or the 8-hour concert, we have found many examples\nof counterintuitive, often humorous struggles with constraints and conventions\nin the crafting of classifications. For instance, as we shall see in Chapter\n5, in analyzing the experience of tuberculosis patients in Mann\u2019s <i>The\nMagic Mountain, </i>we found the story of one woman who had been incarcerated\nso long in the sanatorium that leaving it became unthinkable. She recovered\nfrom the disease, but tried to subvert the diagnosis of wellness. When\nthe doctors took her temperature, she would surreptitiously dip the thermometer\nin hot water to make it seem that she still had a fever. On discovering\nthis, the doctors created a thermometer without markings, so that she could\nnot tell what the mercury column indicated. They called this \"the silent\nsister.\" The silent sister immediately becomes itself a telling indicator\nof the entangled infrastructure, medical politics, and the use of metrics\nin classifying tubercular patients. It tells a rich metaphorical story,\nand may become a concept useful beyond the rarified walls of the fictional\nSwiss asylum. What other silent sisters will we encounter in our infrastructural\ninversion \u2013 what surveillance, deception, caring, struggling, or negotiating?\n<p>In the sections below, we present four themes that require the special\ndouble vision implied in the anecdotes above. They frame the new way of\nseeing which brings to life large-scale, bureaucratic classifications and\nstandards. Without this map, excursions into this aspect of information\ninfrastructure can be stiflingly boring. Many classifications appear as\nnothing more than lists of numbers with labels attached, buried in software\nmenus, users\u2019 manuals, or other references. As we discuss in Chapter 2,\nnew eyes are needed for reading classification systems, for restoring the\ndeleted and desiccated narratives to these peculiar cultural/technical/scientific\nartifacts.\n<p><b>Methodological Themes for Infrastructural Inversion</b>\n<p><b>1. Ubiquity</b>\n<p>The first major theme is the <b>ubiquity</b> of classifying and standardizing.\nClassification schemes and standards literally saturate our environment.\nIn the built world we inhabit, thousands and thousands of standards are\nused everywhere, from setting up the plumbing in a house to assembling\na car engine to transferring a file from one computer to another. Consider\nthe canonically simple act of writing a letter longhand, putting it in\nan envelope and mailing it. There are standards for (inter alia): paper\nsize, the distance between lines in lined paper, envelope size, the glue\non the envelope, the size of stamps, their glue, the ink in your pen, the\nsharpness of its nib, the composition of the paper (which in turn can be\nbroken down to the nature of the watermark, if any; the degree of recycled\nmaterial used in its production, the definition of what counts as recycling).\nAnd so forth.\n<p>Similarly, in any bureaucracy, classifications abound -- consider the\nsimple but increasingly common classifications that are used when you dial\nan airline for information (\"if you are traveling domestically, press 1\";\n\"if you want information about flight arrivals and departures....\"). And\nonce the airline has hold of you, you are classified by them as a frequent\nflyer (normal, gold or platinum); corporate or individual; tourist or business\nclass; short haul or long haul (different fare rates and scheduling apply).\n<p>Howard Becker relates a delightful anecdote concerning his classification\nby an airline. A relative working for one of the airlines told him how\ndesk clerks handle customer complaints. The strategy is first to try to\nsolve the problem. If the customer remains unsatisfied, and becomes very\nangry in the process, the clerk dubs him or her \"an irate\". The clerk then\ncalls the supervisor, \"I have an irate on the line,\" shorthand for the\ncategory of <i>very</i> irritated passenger.\n<p>One day Becker was having a difficult interaction with the same airline.\nHe called the airline desk, and in a calm tone of voice, said, \"Hello,\nmy name is Howard Becker and I\u2019m an irate. Can you help me with this ticket?\"\nThe clerk began to sputter, \"How did you know that word?!!\" Becker had\nsucceeded in unearthing a little of the hidden classificatory apparatus\nbehind the scenes at the airline. He notes that the interaction after this\nspeeded up and went particularly smoothly.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>This categorical saturation furthermore forms a complex web. While it\nis possible to pull out a single classification scheme or standard for\nreference purposes, in reality none of them stand alone. So a subproperty\nof ubiquity is interdependence, and frequently, integration. A systems\napproach might see the proliferation of both standards and classifications\nas purely a matter of integration -- almost like a gigantic web of interoperability.\nYet the sheer density of these phenomena go beyond questions of interoperability.\nThey are layered, tangled, textured; they interact to form an ecology as\nwell as a flat set of compatibilities. That is to say, they facilitate\nthe co-ordination of heterogeneous \u2018dispositifs techniques\u2019 (Foucault,\n1975). They are lodged in different communities of practice - such as laboratories,\nrecords offices, insurance companies and so forth. There <i>are </i>spaces\nbetween (unclassified, non-standard areas), of course, and these are equally\nimportant to the analysis. It seems that increasingly these spaces are\nmarked as unclassified and non-standard.\n<p>It is a struggle to step back from this complexity and think about the\nissue of ubiquity, rather than try to trace the myriad connections in any\none case. The ubiquity of classifications and standards is curiously difficult\nto see \u2013 as we are quite schooled in ignoring both, for a variety of interesting\nreasons. We also need concepts for understanding movements, textures, and\nshifts that will grasp patterns within the ubiquitous larger phenomenon.\nThe distribution of residual categories (\u2018not elsewhere classified\u2019 or\n\u2018other\u2019) is one such concept. \u2018Others\u2019 are everywhere, structuring social\norder. Another such concept might be what Strauss et al. (1985) call a\n\u2018cumulative mess trajectory.\u2019 In medicine, this occurs when one has an\nillness, is given a medicine to cure the illness, but incurs a serious\nside effect, which then needs to be treated with another medicine, etc.\nIf the trajectory becomes so tangled that you cannot turn back, and the\ninteractions multiply, \u2018cumulative mess\u2019 results. We see this phenomenon\nin the interaction of categories and standards all the time -- ecological\nexamples are particularly rich places to look.\n<p><b>Materiality and Texture</b>\n<p>The second methodological departure point is that<b> </b>classifications\nand standards are <b>material</b>, as well as symbolic. How do we perceive\nthis densely saturated classified and textured world? Under the sway of\ncognitive idealism, it is easy to see classifications as properties of\nmind and standards as ideal numbers or floating cultural inheritances.\nBut they have material force in the world. They are built into and embedded\nin every feature of the built environment (and many of the nature/culture\nborderlands, such as with engineered genetic organisms).\n<p>All classification and standardization schemes are a mixture of physical\nentities such as paper forms, plugs, or software instructions encoded in\nsilicon, and conventional arrangements such as speed and rhythm, dimension,\nand how specifications are implemented. Perhaps because of this mixture,\nthe web of intertwined schemes can be difficult to see. In general, the\ntrick is to question every apparently natural easiness in the world around\nus and look for the work involved in making it easy. Within a project or\non a desktop, the seeing consists in seamlessly moving between the physical\nand the conventional. So when a computer programmer writes some lines of\nJava code, she moves within conventional constraints and makes innovations\nbased on them; at the same time, she strikes plastic keys, shifts notes\naround on a desktop, and consults manuals for various standards and other\ninformation. If we were to try to list out all the classifications and\nstandards involved in writing a program, the list could run to pages. Classifications\ninclude types of objects, types of hardware, matches between requirements\ncategories and code categories, and meta-categories such as the goodness\nof fit of the piece of code with the larger system under development. Standards\nrange from the precise integration of the underlying hardware to the 60Hz\npower coming out of the wall through a standard size plug.\n<p>Merely reducing the description to the physical aspect such as the plugs\ndoes not get us anywhere interesting in terms of the actual mixture of\nphysical and conventional or symbolic. A good operations researcher could\ndescribe how and whether things would work together, often purposefully\nblurring the physical/conventional boundaries in making the analysis. But\nwhat is missing is a sense of the landscape of work as experienced by those\nwithin it. It gives no sense of something as important as the texture of\nan organization: it is smooth or rough? Bare or knotty? What is needed\nis a sense of the topography of all of the arrangements -- are they colliding?\nco-extensive? gappy? orthogonal? One way to get at these questions is to\ntake quite literally the kinds of metaphors that people use when describing\ntheir experience of organizations, bureaucracies, and information systems,\ndiscussed in more detail in Chapter 9.\n<p>When we think of classifications and standards as both material and\nsymbolic, we adapt a set of tools not usually applied to them. There are\ntools for analysing built structures, such as structural integrity, enclosures\nand confinements, permeability, and durability, among many others. Structures\nhave texture, and depth. The textural way of speaking of classifications\nand standards is common in organizations and groups. Metaphors of tautness,\nknots, fabrics and networks pervade modern language (Lakoff and Johnson,\n1980).\n<p><b>The Indeterminacy of the Past: Multiple times, multiple voices</b>\n<p>The third methodological theme concerns <b>the past as indeterminate</b>.\nWe are constantly revising our knowledge of the past in light of new developments\nin the present. This is not a new idea to historiography, or to biography.\nWe change our resumes as we acquire new skills to seem like smooth, planned\npaths of development, even if the change had been unexpected or undesired.\nWhen we become members of new social worlds, we often retell our life stories\nin new terminology. A common example of this is religious conversion, where\nthe past is retold as exemplifying errors, sinning and repentance (Strauss,\n1959). Or when coming out as gay or lesbian, childhood behaviors and teenage\ncrushes become indicators of early inklings of sexual choice (Wolfe and\nStanley, 1980).\n<p>At wider levels of scale, these revisions also mean the introduction\nof new voices \u2013 many possible kinds of interpretations of categories, texts,\nand artifacts. Multiple voices and silences are represented in any scheme\nthat attempts to sort out the world. No one classification organizes reality\nfor everyone -- e.g. the red light-yellow light-green light traffic light\ndistinctions don\u2019t work for blind people (who need sound coding). In looking\nto classification schemes as ways of ordering the past, it is easy to forget\nthose who have been overlooked in this way. Thus, the indeterminacy of\nthe past implies recovering multi-vocality; it also means understanding\nhow standard narratives that seem universal have been constructed (Star,\n1991a).\n<p>There is no way of ever getting access to the past except through classification\nsystems of one sort or another - formal or informal, hierarchical or not\n... . Take the apparently unproblematic statement: \"In 1640, the English\nRevolution occurred; this led to a twenty year period in which the English\nhad no monarchy\". The classifications involved here, all problematic, include:\n<ul>\n<li>\nthe current segmentation of time into days, months and years. Accounts\nof the English revolution generally use the Gregorian calendar, which was\nadopted some hundred years later - so causing translation problems with\ncontemporary documents;</li>\n\n<li>\nthe classification of \u2018peoples\u2019 into English, Irish, Scots, French and\nso on. These designations were by no means so clear at the time - the whole\ndiscourse of \u2018national genius\u2019 or character really only arose in the nineteenth\ncentury;</li>\n\n<li>\nthe classification of events into revolutions, reforms, revolts, rebellions\nand so forth (cf. Furet, 1978 on thinking the French revolution). There\nreally was no concept of \u2018revolution\u2019 at the time; our current conception\nis marked by the historiographical work of Karl Marx.</li>\n\n<li>\nwhat do we classify as being a \u2018monarchy\u2019? There is a strong historiographical\ntradition that says that Oliver Cromwell was a monarch - he walked, talked\nand acted like one after all. Under this view, there is no hiatus at all\nin this English institution; rather a usurper took the throne.</li>\n</ul>\nThere are two major historiographic schools of thought with respect to\nusing classification systems on the past. One maintains that we should\nonly use classifications available to actors at the time, much as an ethnographer\ntries faithfully to mirror the categories of their respondents. Authors\nin this tradition warn against the dangers of anachronism. Hacking (1995)\non child abuse is a sophisticated version which we discuss in Chapter 7.\nIf a category did not exist contemporaneously, it should not be retroactively\napplied.\n<p>The other school of thought holds that we should use the real classifications\nthat progress in the arts and sciences has uncovered. Often, history informed\nby current sociology will take this path. For example, Tort\u2019s (1989) work\non \u2018genetic\u2019 classification systems (which were not so called at the time,\nbut which are of vital interest to the Foucaldian problematic) imposes\na <i>post hoc</i> order on nineteenth century classification schemes in\na variety of sciences. Even though those schemes were perceived by their\ncreators as responding solely to the specific needs of the discipline they\nwere dealing with (etymology, say, or mineralogy), he demonstrates that\nthere was a link between many different schemes (both direct in terms of\npeople shifting disciplines and conceptual in terms of their organization)\nthat allows us to perceive an order nowhere apparent to contemporaries.\n<p>From a Pragmatist point of view, both aspects are important in analyzing\nthe consequences of modern systems of classification and standardization.\nWe seek always to understand classification systems according to the work\nthat they are doing, and the networks within which they are embedded. That\nentails both an understanding of the categories of those designing and\nusing the systems, and a set of analytic questions derived from our own\nconcerns as analysts.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\"><i>When is it a Harley</i>?</font>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">One of the ways the past becomes indeterminate\nis through gradual shifts in what it means to \"really be\" something --\nthe essence of it.</font>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">Sitting in a tattoo parlor, surrounded by people\nI don\u2019t usually hang out with. Young men in black leather vests and sun-bleached\nhair. I turn to the waiting room reading material, which in this case is\nthe monthly Thunder Press, a newsletter for motorbike aficionados. The\nlead article asks the question: \"Is It Still a Harley\" if you have customized\nyour bike yourself. The Oregon Department of Motor Vehicles makes the definitive\ncall:</font>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">\"Anything that is not totally factory-built will\nmake it a reconstructed motorcycle, and it will be called \u2018Assembled\u2019 on\nthe title.\" (p. 69)</font>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">A major activity in the Harley social world is\ncustomizing features of one\u2019s motorcycle, and there are important symbolic\nand affiliative signs attached to the customizing process. Deleting the\nname Harley from the registration form is perceived as an insult to the\nowner, and this insult is stitched together in the article with others\nthat come from the government toward bikers (restricting meeting places,\ninsisting on helmet-wearing, being overly enthusiastic in enforcing traffic\nviolations by bikers).</font>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">This is a pure example of the politics of essence,\nof identity politics. It is echoed in many areas of life, for example,\nin James Davis\u2019 (1991) classic study, <i>Who Is Black?</i> where the question\nof the one-drop rule in the United States, and the rejection of mixed-race\npeople as a legitimate category is an old and a cruel story. The central\nprocess here is the distillation of the <i>sine qua non</i> out from the\nmessy and crenellated surrounds -- the rejection of marginality in favor\nof purity.</font>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">When this occurs, the suffering of the marginal\nbecomes privatized and distributed, creating the conditions for pluralistic\nignorance (\"I\u2019m the only one\"). Meeting the purity criteria of the essentialized\ncategory also becomes bureaucratized, and again the onus is shifted to\nthe individual alone. Only when the category is joined with a social movement\ncan the black box of essence be re-opened, as for example with the recent\nuprisings and demonstrations of mixed race Hispanic people toward the US\nCensus and its rigid categories. The problem becomes clear if one is both\nBlack and Hispanic, a common combination in the Caribbean. Which shall\nbe the master trait through which the government perceives you?</font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">--Leigh Star</font></center>\n\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">References: Anonymous, \"Is it Still a Harley,\"\nThunder Press 5:4 (July, 1996: 1 and 69).</font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>When we ask historical questions about the deeply and heterogeneously\nstructured space of classification systems and standards, we are dealing\nwith a 4-dimensional archaeology. The systems move in space, time and process.\nSome of the archaeological structures we uncover are stable, some in motion;\nsome evolving, some decaying. They are not consistent. An institutional\nmemory, about, for example, an epidemic, can be held simultaneously and\nwith internal contradictions (sometimes piecemeal or distributed and sometimes\nwith entirely different stories at different locations) across a given\ninstitutional space.\n<p>In the case of AIDS, classifications have shifted significantly over\nthe last 20 years, including the invention of the category in the 1980s\n(from Gay-Related Immune Disorder (GRID) through a chain of other monikers\nto the now-accepted Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). It is now to\nsome extent possible to look backwards at cases which might previously\nhave been AIDS (Grmek, 1990) before we had the category (a problematic\ngaze to be sure, as Bruno Latour (forthcoming) has written about tuberculosis).\nThere are epidemiological stories about trying to collect information about\na shameful disease; there is a wealth of personal and public narratives\nabout living with it. There is a public health story and a virology story,\nwhich use different category systems. There are the standardized forms\nof insurance companies and the categories and standards of the census bureau.\nWhen an attempt was made to combine these data in the 1980s to disenfranchise\nyoung men living in San Francisco from health insurance, the resultant\npolitical challenge stopped the combination of this data from being so\nused. At the same time, the San Francisco blood banks refused for years\nto employ HIV screening, thus denying the admission of another category\nto their blood labeling -- as Shilts (1987) tells us, with many casualties\nas a result. Whose story has categorical ascendancy here? That question\nis forever morally moot \u2013 all of the stories are important, and all of\nthe categories tell a different one.\n<p><b>Practical Politics</b>\n<p>The fourth major theme is uncovering <b>the practical politics of classifying\nand standardizing</b>. This is the design end of the spectrum of investigating\ncategories and standards as technologies. There are two processes associated\nwith these politics: arriving at categories and standards, and, along the\nway, deciding what will be visible or invisible within the system.\n<p>It follows from the indeterminacy discussed above that the spread or\nenforcement of categories and standards involves negotiation or force.\nWhatever appears as universal or, indeed, standard, is the result of negotiations,\norganizational processes, and conflict. How do these negotiations take\nplace? Who determines the final outcome in preparing a formal classification?\nVisibility issues arise as one decides where to make the cuts in the system,\nfor example, down to what level of detail one specifies a description of\nwork, of an illness, of a setting. Because there are always advantages\nand disadvantages to being visible, this becomes crucial in the workability\nof the schema. As well, ordinary biases of what should be visible, or legitimated,\nwithin a particular scheme, are always in action. The tradeoffs involved\nin this sort of politics are discussed in Chapters 5 (on tuberculosis)\nand 7 (on nursing work).\n<p>Someone, somewhere, often a body of people in the proverbial gray suits\nand smoke-filled rooms, must decide and argue over the minutiae of classifying\nand standardizing. The negotiations themselves form the basis for a fascinating\npractical ontology -- our favorite example is when is someone really alive?\nIs it breathing, attempts at breathing, movement....? And how long must\neach of those last? Whose voice will determine the outcome is sometimes\nan exercise of pure power: we, the holders of Western medicine and scions\nof colonial regimes, will decide what a disease is, and simply obviate\nsystems such as acupuncture or Aryuvedic medicine. Sometimes the negotiations\nare more subtle, involving questions such as the disparate viewpoints of\nan immunologist and a surgeon, or a public health official (interested\nin even ONE case of the plague) and a statistician (for whom one case is\nnot relevant).\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b><font color=\"#3333FF\">There\u2019s no such thing as a rodent</font></b>\n<p><font color=\"#3333FF\">An article in the San Jose Mercury News by Rick\nWeiss declares: \"Researchers say there\u2019s no such thing as a rodent.\" He\nquotes an article from <i>Nature</i>, which argues thatthe 2,000 species\nof animals ordinarily considered rodents, including rats, mice, and guinea\npigs -- did not evolve from a common ancestor. The finding is deeply controversial.\nWeiss says, \"On one side are researchers who have spent their careers hunched\nover fossils or skeletal remains to determine which animals evolved from\nwhich.\" On the other, the article continues, are those who would use DNA\nanalysis to make the determination. The fossil studiers say that DNA is\nnot yet accurate enough. The classification of species has always been\ndeeply controversial. Biologists speak of a rough cut among their ranks:\nlumpers (those who see fewer categories and more commonalties) vs. splitters\n(those who would name a new species with fewer kinds of difference cited).\nThere are always practical consequences for these names. Splitters, for\nexample, often included people who wanted a new species named after them,\nand the more species there are, the more likely is an eponymous label.\nThe deliberately provocative headline of this article demands a response:\n\"well, don\u2019t tell that to my cat.\" We often refer implicitly in this fashion\nto the power of naming -- blurring the name of the category with its members.\n(<i>San Jose Mercury News</i>. ( June 13, 1996: 5A - by Rick Weiss)</font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p>Once a system is in place, the practical politics of these decisions\nare often forgotten, literally buried in archives (when records are kept\nat all) or built into software or the sizes and compositions of things.\nIn addition to our archaeological expeditions into the records of such\nnegotiations, this book provides some observations of the negotiations\nin action.\n<p>Finally, even where everyone agrees on how classifications or standards\nshould be established, there are often practical difficulties about how\nto craft them. For example, a classification system with 20,000 bins on\nevery form is practically unusable for data entry purposes. The constraints\nof technological record keeping come into play at every turn. For example,\nthe original International Classification of Diseases had some 200 diseases\nnot because of the nature of the human body and its problems but because\nthis was the maximum number that would fit the large census sheets then\nin use.\n<p>Sometimes the decision simply about how fine-grained to make the system\nhas political consequences as well. For instance, describing and recording\nsomeone\u2019s tasks, as in the case of nursing work, may mean controlling or\nsurveilling their work as well, and may imply an attempt to take away discretion.\nAfter all, the loosest classification of work is accorded to those with\nthe most power and discretion, who are able to set their own terms. There\nare financial stakes as well. In a study of a health insurance company\u2019s\nsystem of classifying for doctor and patient reimbursement, Gerson and\nStar (1986), found that doctors wanted the most fine-grained of category\nsystems, so that each procedure could be reimbursed separately, and thus\nmost profitably. Data entry personnel and hospital administrators, among\nothers, wanted broader, simpler and coarser-grained categories for reasons\nof efficiency. These conflicts were, however, invisible to the outside\nworld, which received only the forms for reimbursement purposes and a copy\nof the codebook for reference. Both the content of the categories and the\nstructure of the overall scheme are concerns for due process within organizations\n\u2013 whose voice will be heard, and when will enough data, of the right granularity,\nhave been collected?\n<p><b>Infrastructure and Method: Convergence</b>\n<p>These ubiquitous, textured classifications and standards help frame\nour representation of the past and the sequencing of events in the present.\nThey can best be understood as doing the ever-local, ever-partial work\nof making it appear that science describes nature (and nature alone) and\nthat politics is about social power (and social power alone). Consider\nthe case of psychoanalysts discussed at length in Young (1995); Kirk and\nKutchins (1992) and Kutchins and Kirk (1997). In order to receive reimbursement\nfor their procedures, they now need to couch them in a biomedical language\n(the DSM). Theoretically, this rubric is anathema to them, systematically\nreplacing the categories of psychoanalysis with the language of the pharmacopoeia\nand of the biochemistry of the brain. However, the DSM is the lingua franca\nof the medical insurance companies. Thus, psychoanalysts use the categories\nnot only to obtain reimbursement, but as a shorthand to communicate with\neach other. There are local translation mechanisms that allow the DSM to\ncontinue to operate in this fashion, and at the same time, to become the\nsole legal, recognized representation of mental disorder. A \u2018reverse engineering\u2019\nof the DSM or the ICD reveals the multitude of local political and social\nstruggles and compromises which go into the constitution of a \u2018universal\u2019\nclassification.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b>Fitting Categories to Circumstances</b>\n<p>An academic friend on the East Coast tells an anecdote of negotiation\nwith her long-term psychoanalyst about how to fill out her insurance forms.\nShe was able to receive several free sessions of therapy a year under her\nhealth insurance plan. Each year, she and her therapist would discuss how\nbest to categorize her. It was important to represent the illness as serious\nand long-term. At the same time, they were worried that the information\nabout the diagnosis might not always remain confidential. What could they\nlabel her that would be both serious and non-stigmatizing? Finally, they\nsettled on the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive. No academic would ever\nbe penalized for being obsessive-compulsive, our friend concluded with\na wry laugh! (Kirk and Kutchins (1992) document similar negotiations between\npsychiatrists and patients.)\n<p>Standards, categories, technologies and phenomenology are increasingly\nconverging in large-scale information infrastructure. As we have indicated\nin this chapter, this convergence poses both political and ethical questions.\nThese questions are by no means obvious in ordinary moral discourse. For\nall the reasons given above, large-scale classification systems are often\ninvisible, erased by their naturalization into the routines of life. Conflict\nand multiplicity are often buried beneath layers of obscure representation.\n<p>Methodologically, we do not stand outside these systems, nor pronounce\non their mapping to some otherworldly \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018constructed\u2019 nature. Rather,\nwe are concerned with what they do, pragmatically speaking, as scaffolding\nin the conduct of modern life. Part of that analysis means understanding\nthe co-construction of classification systems with the means for data collection\nand validation.\n<p>In order to clarify our position here, let us take an analogy. In the\nearly nineteenth century in England there were a huge number of capital\ncrimes - starting from stealing a loaf of bread and going up. However,\nprecisely because the penalties were so draconian, few juries would ever\nimpose the maximum sentence; and indeed there was actually a drastic reduction\nin the number of executions even as the penal code was progressively strengthened.\nThere are two ways of writing this history - one can either concentrate\non the creation of the law; or one can concentrate on the way things worked\nout in practice. This is very similar to the position taken in Latour\u2019s<i>\nWe Have Never Been Modern </i>(1993). He argues that<i> </i>we can either\nlook at what scientists say that they are doing (working within a purified\nrealm of knowledge) or at what they actually are doing (manufacturing hybrids\nof nature-culture). We think both are important. We are advocating here\na pragmatic methodological development -- pay more attention to the classification\nand standardization work that allows for hybrids to be manufactured and\nso more deeply explore the terrain of the politics of science in action.\n<p>The point for us is that both words and deeds are valid kinds of account.\nEarly sociology of science in the actor-network tradition concentrated\non the ways in which it comes to seem that science gives an objective account\nof natural order: trials of strength, enrolling of allies, cascades of\ninscriptions and the operation of immutable mobiles (Latour, 1987; 1988).\nIt drew attention to the importance of the development of standards (though\nnot to the linked development of classification systems); but did not look\nat these in detail. Sociologists of science invited us to look at the process\nof producing something which looked like what the positivists alleged science\nto be. We got to see the Janus face of science, as both constructed and\nrealist. In so doing we followed the actors, often ethnographically. We\nshared their insights (allies must be enrolled, translation mechanisms\nmust be set in train so that, in the canonical case, Pasteur\u2019s laboratory\nwork can be seen as a direct translation of the quest for French honor\nafter defeat in the battlefield - Latour, 1988).\n<p>However, by the very nature of the method, we also shared the actors\u2019\nblindness. The actors being followed did not themselves <i>see</i> what\nwas excluded: they constructed a world in which that exclusion could occur.\nThus if we just follow the doctors who create the International Classification\nof Diseases at the World Health Organization in Geneva, we will not see\nthe variety of representation systems that other cultures have for classifying\ndiseases of the body and spirit; and we will not see the fragile networks\nthese classification systems subtend. Rather, we will see only those who\nare strong enough, and shaped in such a fashion as to impact allopathic\nmedicine. We will see the blind leading the blind.\n<p>This blindness occurs by changing the world such that the system\u2019s description\nof reality becomes true. Thus, for example, consider the case where all\ndiseases are classified purely physiologically. Systems of medical observation\nand treatment are set up such that physical manifestations are the only\nmanifestations recorded. Physical treatments are the only treatments available.\nUnder these conditions, then, logically schizophrenia may only result purely\nand simply from a chemical imbalance in the brain. It will be impossible\nto think or act otherwise. We have called this the principle of <i>convergence\n</i>(Star\nand Bowker, 1994; Star, Bowker and Neumann, in press).\n<p><b>Resistance</b>\n<p>Reality is \u2018that which resists,\u2019 according to Latour\u2019s (1987) pragmatist-inspired\ndefinition. The resistances that designers and users encounter will change\nthe ubiquitous networks of classifications and standards. While convergence\nmay seem at times to create an inescapable cycle of feedback and verification,\nthe very multiplicity of people, things and processes involved mean that\nthey are never locked in for all time.\n<p>The methods in this chapter offer an approach to resistance as a reading\nof where and how political work is done in the world of classifications\nand standards; and how such artifacts can be problematized and challenged.\nDonald MacKenzie\u2019s (1990) wonderful study of \u2018missile accuracy\u2019 furnishes\nthe best example of this approach. In a concluding chapter to his book,\nhe discusses the possibility of \u2018uninventing the bomb\u2019, by which he means\nchanging society and technology in such a way that the atomic bomb becomes\nan impossibility. Such change, he suggests, can be carried out in part\nat the overt level of political organizations. However, and crucially for\nour purposes, he also sensitizes the reader to the site of the development\nand maintenance of technical standards as a site of political decisions\nand struggle. Standards and classifications, however dry and formal on\nthe surfaces are suffused with traces of political and social work. Whether\nwe wish to uninvent any particular aspect of complex information infrastructure\nis properly a political and a public issue. Because it has rarely been\ncast in that light, tyrannies of various sorts flourish. Some are the tyrannies\nof inertia \u2013 red tape \u2013 rather than explicit public policies. Others are\nthe quiet victories of infrastructure builders inscribing their politics\ninto the systems. Still other are almost accidental \u2013 systems that become\nso complex that no one person and no organization can really predict or\nadminister good policy.\n<p>The magic of modern technoscience is a lot of hard work, smoke-filled\nrooms, and boring lists of numbers and settings. Tyranny or democracy,\nits import on our lives cannot be denied. This chapter has offered a number\nof points of departure for evaluation, resistance, and better analysis\nof one of its least-understood aspects.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<center>\n<p><font size=+1>PART ONE</font>\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b><font size=+1>CLASSIFICATION AND LARGE SCALE INFRASTRUCTURES</font></b></center>\n\n<p><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>In the following three chapters, which analyze the International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD) we shall look at the operation of classification systems\nin supporting large-scale infrastructural arrangements.

Throughout the\nbook we have demonstrated that categories are tied to the things that people\ndo; to the worlds to which they belong. In large-scale systems, those worlds\noften come into conflict. The conflicts are resulted a variety of ways.\nSometimes boundary objects are created which allow for cooperation across\nthe borders. At other times, such as in the case of apartheid, voices are\nstifled, and violence obtains.\n<p>Chapter 9 discusses an abstract model of the several processes involved\nin both the development of boundary objects, or any other alternatives.\nThe key concept in this chapter is multiplicity; the multiplicity both\nof people's memberships, and of the ways in which objects are naturalized\nsimultaneously in more than one world. People become members of many communities\nof practice. They do so it different rates, and with different degrees\nof completeness. Some communities are all encompassing, others occupy very\nlittle of one's life space. Some things in shared quite locally; others\nbecome standardized across thousands of social worlds. While it is impossible,\nand will always be impossible, fully to map the myriad of relationships\neven a simple situation contains, it is possible to get at least a gestalt\nsense of the issues involved.\n<p>The chapter discusses the multiple trajectories of membership and naturalization.\nIt discusses the consequences of some memberships being silenced, ignored,\nor devalued. It examines the notion of \"cyborg,\" as a term for discussing\nthe relationships between memberships and the naturalization of objects.\nThe categorical exile of people and objects creates a monstrous landscape,\nsuch as those seen in chapters 5 and 6.\n<p>The chapter concludes with recognition of the language that people often\nuse in describing the complexities of people, things and their relationships.\nWe often turn to metaphors of texture to describe our sense we moral, emotional\nand organizational feeling of these relationships. A situation can be knotty\nand tangled; it can be handled smoothly and without ruffles. Following\nLakoff and Johnson (1980), we take these \"metaphors we live by\" as more\nthan poetic but imprecise means of expression. The metaphors are more systematic\nand more telling than that. Indeed, they are a key to understanding and\nperhaps to modeling some of the more complex phenomena facing us in what\nIna Wagner (personal communication) has called \"the classification society.\"\n<p>The book concludes with a discussion of the ways in which research on\nclassification and standards can inform a larger program of research into\nthe building and maintaining of infrastructure -- and its simultaneous\nmaterial/cultural nature.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b>Chapter Nine: Categorical Work and Boundary Infrastructures: Enriching\nTheories of Classification</b>\n<p>Where do categories come from? How do they span the boundaries of the\ncommunities that use them? How can we see and analyze something so ubiquitous\nand infrastructural -- something so \"in between\" a thing and an action?\nThese questions have been at the heart of much of social science over the\npast one hundred years. Sociology and history are both concerned with relationships\n-- which are invisible except through indicators such as the actions people\nperform. One cannot directly <i>see</i> relations such as membership, learning,\nignoring or categorizing. They are names we give to patterns and indicators.\nIf someone is comfortable with the things and language used by a group\nof others, we say that he or she is a member of that group. In this sense,\ncategories -- our own and those of others -- come from action, and in turn\nfrom relationships. They are, as sociologists like Aaron Cicourel remind\nus, continually re-made and refreshed, with a lot of skilled work (1964).\nThe cases in this book are framed in dialogue with an extensive literature\non language, group membership and classification.\n<p>In this chapter, we make several aspects of that dialogue more explicit.\nHowever, our goal here is much more modest than a thoroughgoing analysis\nof categorization and language. We examine classification systems as historical\nand political artifacts, very much as part of modern Western bureaucracy.\nAssigning things, people or their actions to categories is a ubiquitous\npart of work in the modern, bureaucratic state. Categories in this sense\narise from work and from other kinds of organized activity, including the\nconflicts over meaning that occur when multiple groups fight over the nature\nof a classification system and its categories.\n<p>In this chapter, we pick up the theoretical strands of the cases in\nthis volume, to begin to develop a more general notion of classification\nsystems. So doing, we take a step bacnk and look at how the various kinds\nof classifcation we have discussed knit together to form the texture of\na social space. We move from classifying and boundary objects to <i>categorical\nwork and boundary infrastructures</i>, weaving along the way the many strands\nthat our cases have presented. As we noted in Chapter 1, maintaining a\nvision that allows us to see the relationships between people, things,\nmoral order, categories and standards is difficult. It requires a good\nmap and a working compass \u2013 which we shall try to provide below.\n<p>The journey begins by clearing away some of the theoretical brush surrounding\nthe very notions of categories and classification. Many scholars have seen\ncategories as coming from an abstract sense of \"mind,\" little anchored\nin the exigencies of work or politics. The work of attaching things to\ncategories, and the ways in which those categories are ordered into systems,\nis often overlooked (except by theorists of language such as Harvey Sacks,\n1975; 1992).\n<p>We present classification systems in modern organizations as tools that\nare both material and symbolic. As information technologies used to communicate\nacross the boundaries of disparate communities, they have some unique properties.\nNext, we present some basic propositions about large-scale information\nsystems. We examine how they are used to communicate across contexts. These\nsystems are always heterogeneous. Their ecology encompasses the formal\nand the informal, and the arrangements that are made to meet the needs\nof heterogeneous communities \u2013 some cooperative, and some coercive.\n<p>The third part of the journey involves understanding two sets of relationships:\nfirst, and analytically, between people and membership; and between things\nand their naturalization by communities of practice.\n<p>The fourth step moves away from the analytical device of single person-single\nmembership and single object \u2013 single naturalization, to describing a more\ncomplex set of multiple relationships. Everyone is part of multiple communities\nof practice. Things may be naturalized in more than one social world --\nsometimes differently, sometimes in the same fashion. Both people\u2019s memberships\nand the naturalization of objects are multiple \u2013 and these processes are,\nfurthermore, intimately intertwined.\n<p>The fifth part of the chapter introduces the idea of categorical work\n\u2013 the work that people do to juggle both these multiple memberships and\nthe multiple naturalizations of objects. In this work is the genius of\nwhat Sacks called \"doing being ordinary\" (1975) or what Strauss pointed\nto in his \"continual permutations of action\" (1993). In the simplest-seeming\naction, such as picking an article of clothing to wear, is embedded complex\nknowledge of situations (Where will I go today? What should I look like\nfor the variety of activities in which I will participate?) involving multiple\nmemberships and how objects are used differently across communities (will\nthis shirt \"do\" for a meeting with the dean, lunch with a prospective lover,\nand an appointment with the doctor at the end of the day?). Many of these\nchoices become standardized and built into the environment around us --\nfor example, the range of clothing we select is institutionalized by the\nretail stores to which we have access, traditions of costuming, and so\nforth. To think of this formally, the institutionalization of categorical\nwork across multiple communities of practice, over time, produces the structures\nof our lives, from clothing to houses. The parts that are sunk into the\nbuilt environment we call here boundary infrastructures -- objects that\ncross larger levels of scale than boundary objects.\n<p>Finally, we conclude the chapter with a discussion of future directions\nfor research into classifications, standards and their complex relationships\nwith memberships in communities of practice. This includes ways we might\nvisualize and model these intricate relationships.\n<p>The overall goal of the chapter is to trace theoretically what we have\nshown empirically and methodologically throughout the volume: that categories\nare historically situated artifacts, and like all artifacts, are learned\nas part of membership in communities of practice. We want as well to talk\nabout this insight beyond the individual \"mind, \" task, or the small scale\n-- classifications as technologies are powerful artifacts that may link\nthousands of communities, and span highly complex boundaries.\n<p><b>1. What sort of thing is a category?</b>\n<p><i>In so far as the coding scheme establishes an orientation toward\nthe world, it constitutes a structure of intentionality whose proper locus\nis not the isolated, Cartesian mind, but a much larger organizational system,\none that is characteristically mediated through mundane bureaucratic documents\nsuch as forms.</i> (Goodwin, 1996: 65)\n<p>Classification is a core topic within anthropology, especially cognitive\nanthropology, and within computer science, as the quote from Goodwin attests.\nRecently, as we discuss in Chapter 2, there has been a move to understand\nthe practical, work-related aspects of classification, as part of a larger\nproject of revisioning cognition (e.g. Suchman, 1988; Hutchins, 1996; Keller\nand Keller, 1996; Lave, 1986).\n<p><b>Revisioning Cognition</b>\n<p>Within anthropology, psychology and the sociology of science, the last\ntwo decades have seen a resurgence of the struggle to understand the material,\nsocial and ecological aspects of cognition. The work in this book has been\ndeeply informed by that intellectual movement. In brief, the research in\nthis tradition seeks to ground activities previously seen as individual,\nmental and non-social as situated, collective and historically specific.\nOn this view, for example, solving a mathematical problem is not a matter\nof mentally using an algorithm and coming up with the correct answer, in\na fashion that exists outside of time or culture. Rather, it is a process\nof assembling materials close to hand, and using them with others in specific\ncontexts. Jean Lave, for example, studied mathematical problem-solving\nin everyday life, and contrasted it with formal testing situations (1986;\n1988). She followed adults shopping for the best buy in a supermarket,\npeople in Weight Watchers weighing cottage cheese in order to get the correct\nunit for the diet's specifications, and a variety of other mundane activities.\nShe observed people performing highly abstract, creative mathematical problem-solving\nin these circumstances: creating new units of analysis transposed against\ngiven ones in order to measure units, literally cutting up the cottage\ncheese and moving these material units around, or holding one can against\nanother. These tasks were performed successfully by people who tested badly\nin a traditional math test. There was, she argued, no way to separate the\nmaterial circumstances of the problem-solving from the mathematical challenges.\nThose who seem to solve mathematics problems without such outside help\nare not working in a putative realm of pure number. Rather, they and their\nobservers have so naturalized the structures within which they are operating\nthat they have become invisible. Lucy Suchman makes a similar argument\nfor the process of planning as material resource; Ed Hutchins for navigation\nproblems (1993); Janet and Charles Keller for designing and measuring in\ndoing iron blacksmithing work (1996). In this book, we join their effort\nat reforming the notion of categorizing and classifying -- so often seen\nas purely mental.\n<p>The problem of conceptualizing classifications is also akin to Cole\u2019s\n(1996) search for the nature of artifacts in mediated action. Cole notes\nthat:\n<dir>\n<dir>An artifact is an aspect of the material world that has been modified\nover the history of its incorporation into goal-directed human action.\nBy virtue of the changes wrought in the process of their creation and use,\nartifacts are simultaneously <i>ideal </i>(conceptual) and <i>material.\n</i>They\nare ideal in that their material form has been shaped by their participation\nin the interactions of which they were previously a part and which they\nmediate in the present (Cole, 1996: 117).</dir>\n</dir>\nThe materiality of categories, like that of other things associated with\nthe purely cognitive, has been difficult to analyze. The Janus-faced conceptual/material\nnotion of artifacts suggested by Cole, combined with the attention to the\nuse in practice of categories is a good way to begin. Classifications are\nboth conceptual (in the sense of persistent patterns of change and action,\nresources for organizing abstractions) and material (in the sense of being\ninscribed, transported, and affixed to stuff).\n<p>Cole\u2019s intent is to emphasize the conceptual and symbolic sides of things\noften taken as only materials, tools and other artifacts. It is similarly\nfelicitous to emphasize the brute material force of that which has been\nconsidered ideal, such as categories.\n<p><b>1.1 The Pragmatist Turn</b>\n<p>The most radical turn taken by Pragmatist philosophers such as Dewey\nand Bentley, and closely followed by Chicago School sociologists such as\nThomas and Hughes, is perhaps the least understood. It is related, both\nhistorically and conceptually, to the cognitive reforms detailed above.\nConsequences, asserted Dewey against a rising tide of analytic philosophy,\nare the thing to look at in any argument -- not ideal logical antecedents.\nWhat matters about an argument is who, under what conditions, takes it\nto be true. Carried over into sociology, W. I. And Dorothy Thomas used\nit (as Howard Becker would some decades later) to argue against essentialism\nin examining so-called deviants or problem children (Thomas and Thomas,\n1917; Becker, 1964). If social scientist do not understand people\u2019s definition\nof a situation, they do not understand it at all. That definition -- whether\nit is the label of deviant or the performance of a religious ritual --\nis what people will shape their behavior towards.\n<p>This is a much more profound cut on social construction than the mere\nnotion that people construct their own realities. It makes no comment on\nwhere the definition of the situation may come from -- human or nonhuman,\nstructure or process, group or individual. It powerfully draws attention\nto the fact that the materiality of anything (action, idea, definition,\nhammer, gun or school grade) is drawn from the consequences of its situation.\n<p>The Pragmatist turn, like the activity theoretical turn taken by Cole\nand others, emphasizes the ways in which things perceived as real may mediate\naction (Star, 1996). If someone is taken to be a witch, and elaborate technical\napparatus with which to diagnose her or him as such is developed, then\nthe reality of witchcraft obtains in the consequences -- perhaps death\nat the stake. Classification systems are one form of technology, used in\nthe sense Cole employs, linked together in elaborate informatic systems\nand enjoining deep consequences for those touched by them.\n<p>The following section discusses the problems of scaling up, from boundary\nobjects and classifications systems on the one hand, to a notion of boundary\ninfrastructure. This draws together the notions of multiplicity and the\nsymbolic/material aspects of categories as artifacts discussed above.\n<p><b>2. Information Systems across Contexts</b>\n<p>At its most abstract, the design and use of information systems involves\nlinking experience gained in one time and place with that gained in another,\nvia representations of some sort. Even seemingly simple replication and\ntransmission of information from one place to another involves encoding\nand decoding as time and place shift. Thus the context of information shifts\nin spite of its continuities; and this shift in context imparts heterogeneity\nto the information itself. Classifications are a very common sort of representation\nused for this purpose. Formal classification systems are, in part, an attempt\nto regularize the movement of information from one context to another;\nto provide a means of access to information across time and space. The\nICD, for example, moves information across the globe, over decades, and\nacross multiple conflicting medical belief and practice systems.\n<p>One of the interesting features of communication is that, broadly speaking,\nin order to be perceived, information <i>must </i>reside in more than one\ncontext. We know what something is by contrast with what it is not. Silence\nmakes musical notes perceivable; conversation is understood as a contrast\nof contexts, speaker and hearer, words, breaks and breaths. In turn, in\norder to be meaningful, these contexts of information must be <i>re-linked</i>\nthrough some sort of judgment of equivalence or comparability. This occurs\nat all levels of scale, and we all do it routinely as part of everyday\nlife.\n<p>None of this is new in theories of information and communication: we\nhave long had models of signals and targets, background, noise and filters,\nsignals and quality controls. We are moving this insight to the level of\nsocial interaction. That is, people often cannot see what they take for\ngranted until they encounter someone who does not take it for granted.\n<p>A radical statement of this would be that information is only information\nwhen there are <i>multiple</i> interpretations. One person\u2019s noise may\nbe another\u2019s signal, or two people may agree to attend to something --\nbut it is the tension between contexts that actually creates representation.\nWhat becomes problematic under these circumstances is the relationships\nbetween people and things, or objects, the relationships that create representations,\nnot just noise. The ecological approach we have taken in this volume adds\npeople as active interpreters of information, who themselves inhabit multiple\ncontexts of use and practice (Star 1991). This multiplicity is primary,\nnot accidental nor incidental.\n<p>Consider, for example, the design of a computer system to support collaborative\nwriting. Eevi Beck (1995: 53) studied the evolution of one such system:\n\"how two authors, who were in different places, wrote an academic publication\ntogether making use of computers. . .The work they were doing and the way\nin which they did it was inseparable from their immediate environment and\nthe culture which it was part of\". To make the whole system work, they\nhad to juggle time zones, spouses\u2019 schedules, and sensitivities about parts\nof work practice such as finishing each other\u2019s sentences <i>as well as</i>\nmanipulating the technical aspects of the writing software and hardware.\nThey had to build a shared context in which to make sense of the information.\nBeck is arguing against a long tradition of de-contextualized design where\nonly the technical, or narrowly construed considerations about work hold\nsway.\n<p>We lack good relational language here. There is a permanent tension\nbetween the formal and the empirical, the local/situated and attempts to\nrepresent information across localities. It is this tension itself which\nis under-explored and under-theorized. It is not just a set of interesting\nmetaphysical observations. It can also become a pragmatic unit of analysis.\nHow can something be simultaneously concrete and abstract? The same and\nyet different? People are not (yet, we hope) used to thinking in this fashion\nin science or technology. As information systems grow in scale and scope,\nhowever, the need for such complex analyses grows as well. In opposition\nto the old hierarchical databases, where relations between classes had\nto be decided once for all at the time of original creation, many databases\ntoday incorporate object-oriented views of data whereby different attributes\ncan be selected and combined on the fly for different purposes. The tailorability\nof software applications similarly becomes very important for customizing\nuse in different settings (Trigg and B&oslash;dker, 1994).\n<p>If we look at these activities in the context of practice, we see what\nSuchman and Trigg (1993) call the \u2018artful integration\u2019 of local constraints,\nreceived standardized applications, and the re-representation of information.\nThe tension between locales remains. This tension it is not something to\nbe avoided or deleted. When the sort of \"artful integration\" discussed\nby Suchman and Trigg becomes a) an ongoing, stable relationship between\ndifferent social worlds, and b) shared objects are built across community\nboundaries, then boundary objects arise.\n<p>Boundary objects are one way that the tension between divergent viewpoints\nmay be managed. There are of course many other ways. All of them involve\naccommodations, workarounds, and in some sense, a higher level of artful\nintegration. It too is managed by people\u2019s artful juggling, gestalt switching,\nand on the spot translating.\n<p>Too often, this sort of work remains invisible to traditional science\nand technology, or to rational analyses of process. This tension is itself\ncollective, historical, and partially institutionalized. The medium of\nan information system is not just wires and plugs, bits and bytes, but\nalso conventions of representation, information both formal and empirical.\nA system becomes a system in design and use, not the one without the other.\nThe medium <i>is</i> the message, certainly, and it is also the case that\nboth are political creations (Taylor and Van Every, 1993). In Donna Haraway\u2019s\nwords:\n<dir>\n<dir>No layer of the onion of practice that is technoscience is outside\nthe reach of technology of critical interpretation and critical inquiry\nabout positioning and location; that is the condition of embodiment and\nmortality. The technical and the political are like the abstract and the\nconcrete, the foreground and the background, the text and the context,\nthe subject and the object. (Haraway, 1993: 10)</dir>\n</dir>\nA fully developed method of multiplicity/heterogeneity for information\nsystems must draw on many sources and make many unexpected alliances (Star\n1989a: Chapter 1; Star 1989b; Hewitt 1986; Goguen 1997). If both people\nand information objects inhabit multiple contexts, and a central goal of\ninformation systems is to transmit information across contexts, then a\nrepresentation is a kind of pathway that includes everything populating\nthose contexts. This includes people, things/objects, previous representations,\nand information about its own structure. The major requirements for such\nan ecological understanding of the path of re-representation are thus:\n<p>1. How objects can inhabit multiple contexts at once, and have both\nlocal and shared meaning;\n<p>2. How may people who live in one community, and draw their meanings\nfrom people and objects situated there, communicate with those inhabiting\nanother?\n<p>3. How relationships form between 1) and 2) above \u2013 that is, how can\nwe model the information ecology of people and things, across multiple\ncommunities?\n<p>4. What range of solutions to these three questions is possible, and\nwhat moral and political consequences attend each of them -- <i>cui bono</i>?\n<p>Standardization has been one of the common solutions to this class of\nproblems: if interfaces and formats are standard across contexts, then\nat least the first three questions become clear, and the fourth seems to\nbecome moot. But we know from a long and gory history of attempts to standardize\ninformation systems that standards don\u2019t remain standard for very long,\nand that one person\u2019s standard is another\u2019s confusion and mess (Gasser,\n1986; Star, 1991b). We need a richer vocabulary than that of standardization\nor formalization with which to characterize the heterogeneity and the processual\nnature of information ecologies.\n<p><b>3. Boundary Objects and Communities of Practice</b>\n<p>The class of questions posed by the slippage between classifications\nand standards on the one hand, and the contingencies of practice on the\nother, form core problematics in both sociology of science and in studies\nof use and design in information science. A rich body of work has grown\nup in both fields which documents the clever ways people organize and re-organize\nwhen the local circumstances of their activities do not match the prescribed\ncategories or standards (see e.g. Gasser, 1986; Kling and Scacchi, 1982;\nLave, 1988; Sacks, 1975; Star, 1983). Making or using any kind of representation\nis a complex accomplishment, a balance of improvisation and accommodation\nto constraint.\n<p>People learn how to do this everyday, impossible action as they become\nmembers of what Lave and Wenger (1991) call <i>communities of practice</i>,\nor what Strauss (1978) calls <i>social worlds</i>. A community of practice\n(or social world) is a unit of analysis that cuts across formal organizations,\ninstitutions like family and church, and other forms of association such\nas social movements. It is, put simply, a set of relations between people\ndoing things together (Becker, 1986). The activities, with their stuff,\ntheir routines and exceptions, are what constitute the community structure.\nNewcomers to the community learn by becoming \"sort of\" members, what Lave\nand Wenger (1991) call the process of \u2018legitimate peripheral participation.\u2019\nThey have investigated how this membership process unfolds, and how it\nis constitutive of learning.\n<p>We are all in this sense members of various social worlds \u2013 communities\nof practice -- that conduct activities together. Membership in such groups\nis a complex process, varying in speed and ease, with how optional it is,\nand how permanent it may be. One is not born a violinist, as we all know,\nbut gradually becomes a member of the violin-playing community of practice\nthrough a long period of lessons, shared conversations, technical exercises,\nand participation in a range of other related activities.\n<p>People live, with respect to a community of practice, along a trajectory\n(or continuum) of membership, which has elements of both ambiguity and\nduration. They may move from <i>legitimate peripheral participation</i>\nto full membership in the community of practice, and it is extremely useful\nin many ways to conceive of learning this way.\n<p><b>How does this include categories?</b>\n<p>Learning the ropes and rules of practice in any given community entails\na series of encounters with the objects involved in the practice: tools,\nfurniture, texts, and symbols, among others. It also means managing encounters\nwith other people, and with classes of action. Membership in a community\nof practice has as its <i>sine qua non</i> an increasing familiarity with\nthe categories that apply to all of these. As the familiarity deepens,\nso does one\u2019s perception of the object as strange or of the category itself\nas something new and different. Anthropologists call this the <i>naturalization</i>\nof categories or objects. The more at home you are in a community of practice,\nthe more you forget the strange and contingent nature of its categories\nseen from the outside.\n<p>Illegitimacy, then, is seeing those objects as would a stranger -- either\nas a na&iuml;f or by comparison with another frame of reference in which\nthey exist. And this is not to be equated with an idealized notion of skill,\nbut with membership. One does not have to be Isaac Stern to know fully\nand naturally what to do with a violin, where it belongs, and how to act\naround violins and violinists. But if you use a Stradivarius to swat a\nfly (but not as part of an artistic Futurist event!) you have clearly defined\nyourself as an outsider, in a way that a schoolchild practicing scales\nhas not.\n<p>Membership can thus be described individually as the <i>experience</i>\nof encountering objects, and increasingly being in a naturalized relationship\nwith them. (Think of the experience of being at home, and how one settles\ndown and relaxes when surrounded by utterly familiar objects; think of\nhow demented one feels in the process of moving house.)\n<p>From the point of view of learning-as-membership and participation,\nthen, the illegitimate stranger is a source of learning. Someone\u2019s illegitimacy\nappears as a series of interruptions to experience (Dewey 1916; Dewey 1929),\nor a lack of a naturalization trajectory. In a way, then, individual membership\nprocesses are about the resolution of interruptions (anomalies) posed by\nthe tension between the ambiguous (outsider, naive, strange) and the naturalized\n(at home, taken-for-granted) categories for objects. <i>Collectively, </i>membership\ncan be described as the processes of managing the tension between naturalized\ncategories on the one hand, and the degree of openness to immigration on\nthe other. Harvey Sacks, in his extensive investigations into language\nand social life, notes that categories of membership form the basis of\nmany of our judgments about ordinary action. \"You can easily enough come\nto see that for any population of persons present there are available alternative\nsets of categories that can be used on them. That then poses for us an\nutterly central task in our descriptions; to have some way of providing\nwhich set of categories operate in some scene -- in the reporting of that\nscene or in its treatment as it is occurring\" (1991a: 116). Sacks draws\nattention to the ways in which being ordinary are not pre-given but are\nin fact a kind of job -- a job which asserts the nature of membership:\n<dir>\n<dir>Whatever we may think about what it is to be an ordinary person in\nthe world, an initial shift is not to think of an \"ordinary person\" as\nsome person, but as somebody having as their job, as their constant preoccupation,\ndoing \"being ordinary.\" It's not that somebody <i>is </i>ordinary, it's\nperhaps that that's what their business is. And it takes work, as any other\nbusiness does. And if you just extend the analogy of what you obviously\nthink of as work -- as whatever it is that takes analytic, intellectual,\nemotional energy -- then you can come to see that all sorts of normalized\nthings -- personal characteristics and the like -- are jobs which are done,\nwhich took some kind of effort, training, etc.. So I'm not going to be\ntalking about to an \"ordinary person\" as this or that person, or as some\naverage, i.e., a non--exceptional person on some statistical basis, but\nas something that is the way somebody constitutes themselves, and, in effect,\na job that they do on themselves. Fate and the people around and may be\ncoordinatively engaged in assuring that each of them are ordinary persons,\nand that can then be a job that they undertake together, to achieve that\neach of them, together, are ordinary persons (1992b: 216)</dir>\n</dir>\nThe performance of this job includes the ability to choose the proper categories\nunder which to operate, to perform this ordinariness. The power of Sack's\nwork, like that of John Dewey (e.g., 1929), is that he draws attention\nto the ways in which the ordinary -- and the interruption to the expected\nexperience -- are delicate constructions, made and re-made every day.\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<p><b>3.1 Boundary Objects</b>\n<p>Science and technology are good places to study the rich mix of people\nand things brought to bear on complex problem solving questions, although\nthe\npoints made here are more generally applicable as well. Categories and\ntheir boundaries are centrally important in science, and scientists are\nespecially good at documenting and publicly arguing about the boundaries\nof categories. Thus, in turn, science is a good place to understand more\nabout membership in communities. This point of departure has led us to\ntry to understand people and things ecologically, both with respect to\nmembership and with respect to the things they live with, with a focus\non scientists (Star, 1995a). One of the observations is that scientists\nroutinely cooperate across many communities of practice. They thus bring\ndifferent naturalized categories with them into the partnerships.\n<p>In studying scientific problem solving, we have been concerned for a\nnumber of years to understand how scientists <i>could</i> cooperate without\nagreeing about the classification of objects or actions. Scientific work\nis always composed of members of different communities of practice (we\nknow of no science that is not interdisciplinary in this way, especially\nif - as we do - you include laboratory technicians and janitors). Thus,\nmemberships (and divergent viewpoints, or perspectives) present a pressing\nproblem for modeling truth, the putative job of scientists. In developing\nmodels for this work, Star coined the term \u2018boundary objects\u2019 to talk about\nhow scientists balance different categories and meanings (Star and Griesemer,\n1989; Star, 1989b). Again, the term is not exclusive to science, but science\nis an interesting place to study such objects because the push to make\nproblem-solving explicit gives one an unusually detailed amount of information\nabout the arrangements.\n<p>Boundary objects are those objects that both inhabit several communities\nof practice and satisfy the informational requirements of each of them.\nBoundary objects are thus both plastic enough to adapt to local needs and\nconstraints of the several parties employing them, yet robust enough to\nmaintain a common identity across sites. They are weakly structured in\ncommon use, and become strongly structured in individual-site use. These\nobjects may be abstract or concrete. Star and Griesemer (1989) first noticed\nthe phenomenon in studying a museum, where the specimens of dead birds\nhad very different meanings to amateur bird-watchers and professional biologists,\nbut \"the same\" bird was used by each group. Such objects have different\nmeanings in different social worlds but their structure is common enough\nto more than one world to make them recognizable, a means of translation.\nThe creation and management of boundary objects is a key process in developing\nand maintaining coherence across intersecting communities.\n<p>Another way of talking about boundary objects is to consider them with\nrespect to the processes of naturalization and categorization we discussed\nabove. Boundary objects arise over time from durable cooperation between\ncommunities of practice. They are working arrangements that resolve anomalies\nof naturalization without imposing a naturalization of categories from\none community or from an outside source of standardization. (They are therefore\nmost useful in analyzing cooperative and relatively equal situations; issues\nof imperialist imposition of standards, force and deception have a somewhat\ndifferent structure.) In terms of this book, sets of boundary objects arise\ndirectly from the problematics created when two or more differently naturalized\nclassification systems collide. Thus nursing administrators create classification\nsystems which serve hospital administrators and nursing scientists; soil\nscientists create classifications of soil to satisfy geologists and botanists\n(Chatelin, 1979). Other outcomes of these meetings are explored as well\n\u2013 the dominance of one over another; how claims of authority may be manipulated\nto higher claims of naturalness.\n<p>The processes by which communities of practice manage divergent and\nconflicting classification systems are complex, the more so as people are\nall members in fact of many communities of practice, with varying levels\nof commitment and consequence. Under those conditions, how are boundary\nobjects established and maintained? Does the concept scale up? What is\nthe role of technical infrastructure? Is a standard ever a boundary object?\nHow do classification systems, as artifacts, play a role?\n<p><b>4. Membership and Naturalization: People and Things</b>\n<p>As Engestr&ouml;m (1990b) and other activity theorists note so well,\ntools and material arrangements always mediate activity. People never act\nin a vacuum or some sort of hypothetical pure universe of doing, but always\nwith respect to arrangements, tools, and material objects. Strauss has\nrecently made a similar point, emphasizing the continuity and permeability\nof such arrangements -- action never really starts from scratch, from a\ntabula rasa (1993). Both Engestr&ouml;m and Strauss go to great lengths\nto demonstrate that an idea, or something that has been learned, can also\nbe considered as having material/objective force in its consequences and\nmediations.\n<p>\"Object\" includes all of this: stuff and things, tools, artifacts and\ntechniques, and ideas, stories, and memories -- those objects which are\ntreated as consequential by community members (Clarke and Fujimura 1992a;\n1992b). They are used in the service of an action, and mediate it in some\nway. Something actually <i>becomes </i>an object only in the context of\naction and use -- it then becomes as well something that has force to mediate\nsubsequent action. It is easier to see this from historical examples than\nit may be to look to contemporary ones. For instance, the category of hysteria\nwas naturalized in medicine and in popular culture at the end of the 19th-century.\nAs with the example of witchcraft discussed above, people used the diagnosis\nof hysteria for purposes of social control as well as for medical treatment.\nIt became a category through which physicians, social theorists, and novelists\ndiscussed pain and anxiety and, arguably, the changing social status of\nwomen. The point is not who believed what when, but rather that the category\nitself became an object existing in both communities. It was a medium of\ncommunication, whatever else it may also have been.\n<p>A community of practice is defined in large part according to the co-use\nof such objects, since all practice is so mediated. The relationship of\nthe newcomer to the community largely revolves around the nature of the\nrelationship with the objects -- and not, counterintuitively, directly\nwith the people. As noted above with respect to action, this sort of directness\nonly exists hypothetically -- there is always mediation by some sort of\nobject. Acceptance or legitimacy derives from the familiarity of action\nmediated by member objects.\n<p>But familiarity is a fairly sloppy word. We mean it here not instrumentally,\nas in proficiency, but relationally, as a measure of taken-for-grantedness.\n(An inept programmer can still be a member of the community of practice\nof computer specialists, albeit a low status one in that she takes for\ngranted the objects to be used.) A better way to describe the trajectory\nof an object in a community is as one of <i>naturalization.</i> Naturalization\nmeans stripping away the contingencies of an object\u2019s creation and its\nsituated nature. A naturalized object has lost its anthropological strangeness.\nIt is in that narrow sense de-situated -- members have forgotten the local\nnature of the object\u2019s meaning, or the actions that go into maintaining\nand recreating its meaning We no longer think much about the miracle of\nplugging a light into a socket and obtaining illumination, and must make\nan effort of anthropological imagination to remind ourselves of contexts\nin which it is still not naturalized.\n<p>Objects become natural in a particular community of practice over a\nlong period of time (see Latour\u2019s (1987) arguments in <i>Science in Action</i>\nfor a good discussion of this). Objects exist, with respect to a community,\nalong a trajectory of naturalization. This trajectory has elements of both\nambiguity and duration. It is not pre-determined whether an object will\never become naturalized, or how long it will remain so -- rather, practice/activity\nis required to make it so and keep it so. The more naturalized an object\nbecomes, the more unquestioning the relationship of the community to it;\nthe more invisible the contingent and historical circumstances of its birth;\nthe more it sinks into the community\u2019s routinely forgotten memory. Light\nswitches, for instance, are ordinary parts of modern life. Almost all people\nliving in the industrialized world know about light bulbs and electricity,\neven if they live without it, and switches and plugs are naturalized objects\nin most communities of practice. People don\u2019t think twice about their nature,\nonly about whether or not they can find them when needed.\n<p>Commodity and infrastructure technologies are often naturalized in this\nway. In a sense, they become a form of collective forgetting, or naturalization,\nof the contingent, messy work they replace. We wrote this chapter on Macintosh\nand IBM computers; cutting and pasting with it are no longer phenomenologically\nnovel operations, although we can remember when they once were. We have\nnaturalized the mouse, the operation of selecting text, and the anachronistic\n\"cut and paste\" metaphor.\n<p><b>Multiplicity</b>\n<p>In this chapter so far, there are, then<font face=\"Arial\">, </font>analytically\ntwo sets of relationships: between people and membership, on the one hand;\nand objects and naturalization on the other hand. In any given instance,\n<i>both\nmembership and naturalization are relations along a trajectory</i>. In\nsaying this, we do not want to re-create a great divide between people\nand objects, reifying an objectless human or wild child. Ironically in\na way, social science has spent incredible resources on precisely this\nsort of search. There is something compelling about the idea of a person\nwithout \"a society,\" naked even of touch or language. The sad case of \"Genie,\"\na child kept captive by her parents for many years (Rymer, 1993; Star,\n1995d), or the \"wild child of Aveyron\" which amazed 18<sup>th</sup> century\nphilosophers, are emblematic of this propensity. They have been seen as\nholding the key to language, or in a way to what it is to be human.\n<p>However, exactly the opposite is true. People-and-things, which are\nthe same as people-and-society, cannot be separated in any meaningful practical\nsense. At the same time, it is possible for analytical purposes to think\nof two trajectories travelling in tandem, membership and naturalization.\nJust as it is not practically possible to separate a disease from a sick\npatient, yet it is possible to speak of the trajectories of disease and\nbiography operating and pulling at one another, as we have done in Chapter\n5, in the case of tuberculosis.\n<p><b>Residual categories, marginal people, and monsters</b>\n<p>People often seen multiplicity and heterogeneity as accidents or exceptions.\nThe marginal person, who is for example of mixed race, is portrayed as\nthe troubled outsider; just as the thing that doesn\u2019t fit into one bin\nor another gets put into a \"residual\" category. This habit of purity has\nold and complicated origins in western scientific and political culture\n(e.g. as explicated by Dewey, 1916). The habit perpetuates a cruel pluralistic\nignorance. No one is pure. No one is even average. And all things inhabit\nsomeone\u2019s residual category in some category system. The myriad of classifications\nand standards that surround and support the modern world, however, often\nblind people to the importance of the \"other\" category as constitutive\nof the whole social architecture (Derrida, 1980).\n<p>Communities vary in their tastes for openness, and in their tolerance\nfor this ambiguity. Cults, for example, are one sort of collective which\nis low on the openness dimension and correspondingly high on the naturalization/positivism\ndimension -- us <i>vs.</i> them.\n<p>In recent years social theorists have been working toward enriching\nan understanding of multiplicity and misfit, and decentering the idea of\nan unproblematic mainstream. The schools of thought grappling with this\ninclude feminist research (e.g. Haraway, 1997), multi-cultural or race-critical\ntheory (e.g. Ferguson, et al., 1990), symbolic interactionism, and activity\ntheory (e.g., Cole, 1996; Wertsch, 1991; 1998). During the same period,\nsuch issues have become increasingly of concern to some information scientists.\nAs the information systems of the world expand and flow into each other,\nand more kinds of people use them for more different things, it becomes\nharder to hold to pure or universal ideas about representation or information.\n<p>Some of these problems are taken up in the intellectual common territory\nsometimes called cyborg. Cyborg, as used for example by Donna Haraway (1991)\nand Adele Clarke (1993; 1998), means the intermingling of people, things\n(including information technologies), representations and politics in a\nway that challenges both the romance of essentialism and the hype about\nwhat is technologically possible. It acknowledges the interdependence of\npeople and things, and just how blurry the boundaries between them have\nbecome. The notion cyborg has clearly touched a nerve across a broad spectrum\nof intellectual endeavors. The American Anthropological Association has\nhosted sessions on cyborg anthropology for the past several years; the\nweighty <i>Cyborg Handbook</i> was published a few years ago (Gray, 1995).\n<p>Through looking at ubiquitous classification systems and standards,\nit is possible to move towards an understanding of the stuff that makes\nup the networks that shape much of modern daily life in cyborg fashion.\nWe draw attention here to the places where the work gets done of assuring\nthat these networks will stick together: to the places where human and\nnon-human are constructed to be operationally and analytically equivalent.\nSo doing, we explore the political and ethical dimensions of classification\ntheory.\n<p>Why should computer scientists read African-American poets? What does\ninformation science have to do with race critical or feminist methods and\nmetaphysics? The collective wisdom in those domains is one of the richest\nplaces for which to understand these core problems in information systems\ndesign: how to preserve the integrity of information without <i>a priori\n</i>standardization\nand its often-attendant violence. In turn, if those lessons can be taken\nseriously within the emerging cyber world, there may yet be a chance to\nstrengthen its democratic ethical aspects. It is easy to be ethnocentric\nin virtual space; more difficult to avoid stereotypes. The lessons of those\nwho have lived with such stereotypes are important, perhaps now more than\never.\n<p><b>Borderlands and Monsters</b>\n<p>People who belong to more than one central community are also important\nsources for understanding more about the links between moral order and\ncategorization. Such \"marginal\" people have long been interest to social\nscientists and novelists alike. Marginality as a technical term in sociology\nrefers to human membership in more than one community of practice; here\nwe are emphasizing those people who belong to communities that are different\nin key, life-absorbing ways, such as racial groups (as per our discussion\nin Chapter 6). A good example of a marginal person is someone who belongs\nto more than one race, i.e. half white and half Asian. Again, we are not\nusing marginality here in the sense of center/margin or center/periphery\n(e.g., not \u2018in the margins\u2019), but rather in the old-fashioned sense of\nRobert Park\u2019s marginal man, the one who has a double vision by virtue of\nhaving more than one identity to negotiate (Park 1952; Stonequist 1937;\nSimmel 1950 {1908}; Sch&uuml;tz, 1944). Strangers are those who come and\nstay a while, long enough so that membership becomes a troublesome issue\n-- they are not just nomads passing through, but people who sort of belong\nand sort of don\u2019t.\n<p>Marginality is an interesting paradoxical concept for people and things.\nOn the one hand, membership means the naturalization of objects, which\nmediate action. On the other, everyone is a member of multiple communities\nof practice. Yet since different communities generally have differently\nnaturalized objects in their ecology, how can someone maintain multiple\nmembership without becoming simply schizophrenic? How can they naturalize\nthe same object differently, since naturalization by definition demands\nforgetting about other worlds?\n<p>There are as well some well-known processes in social psychology for\nmanaging these tensions and conflicts: passing, or making one community\nthe shadow for the other; splitting, or having some form of multiple personality/chameleon;\nfragmenting or segmenting the self into compartments; becoming a nomad,\nintellectually and spiritually if not geographically (Larsen (1986) covers\nmany of these issues in her exquisite fiction).\n<p>One dissatisfaction we have with these descriptions is that they all\npaint each community of practice as ethnocentric, as endlessly hungry and\nunwilling collectively to accommodate internal contradictions. There is\nalso an implicit idea of a sort of imperialist &uuml;ber-social world (the\nmainstream) that is pressing processes of assimilation on the individual\n(e.g. Americanization processes in the early 20th century). Communities\nvary along this dimension of open/closedness, and it is equally important\nto find successful examples of the nurturing of marginality (although it\nis possible that by definition they exist anarchically and not institutionally/bureaucratically).\nHere again, feminism has some important lessons. An important theme in\nrecent feminist theory is resistance to such imperializing rhetoric and\nthe development of alternative visions of coherence without unconscious\nassumption of privilege. Much of it emphasizes a kind of double-vision,\nsuch as that taken up in the notion of borderlands by Anzald&uacute;a (1987),\nor the qualities of partiality and modesty of Haraway\u2019s cyborg (1991).\n<p>Charlotte Linde\u2019s book on the processes of coherence in someone\u2019s life\nstories also provides some important clues. She especially emphasizes accidents\nand contingency in the weaving together of a coherent narrative (Linde\n1993). The narratives she analyses are in one sense meant to reconcile\nthe heterogeneity of multiply naturalized object relations in the person,\nwhere the objects in question are stories/depictions of life events. Linden\n(1993) and Strauss (1959) have made similar arguments about the uncertainty,\nplasticity, and collectivity of life narratives.\n<p>In traditional sociology this model might have overtones of functionalism,\nin its emphasis on insiders/outsiders and their relations. But functionalists\nnever considered the nature of objects or of multiple legitimate memberships.\nIf we think in terms of a complex cluster of <i>multiple </i>trajectories\n<i>simultaneously</i>\nof both memberships and naturalizations, it is possible to think of a many-to-many\nrelational mapping.\n<p>The mapping suggested here pushes us further into the analysis of the\ncyborg. On the one hand, cyborgs as an image are somehow grotesque. Imagining\nthe relationships between people and things such that they are truly inter-penetrated\nmeans rethinking human nature itself. It is reminiscent somehow of bad\nscience fiction. Yet analytically, it is a crucial notion for understanding\ntechnoscience, and classifications as artifacts.\n<p>How can we think of cyborgs in terms of the analysis presented in this\nchapter? The mapping between things, people, and membership provides a\nway in. Anzald&uacute;a's work on borderlands rejects any notion of purity\nbased on membership in a single, pristine racial, sexual, or even religious\ngroup (1987). Haraway's work pushes this analysis a bit further. In speaking\nof borderlands, both those concerning race and those concerning the boundaries\nbetween humans and things, she employs the term \"monsters.\"\n<p>A monster occurs when an object refuses to be naturalized (Haraway 1992);\na borderland occurs when two communities of practice coexist in one person\n(Anzald&uacute;a 1987). Borderlands are the naturalized home of those monsters\nknown as cyborgs.\n<p>If we read monsters as persistent resisters of transparency/naturalization\nwithin some community of practice, then the experience of encountering\nan anomaly (such as that routinely encountered by a newcomer to science,\nfor instance a woman or man of color) may be keyed back into membership.\nA person realizes that they don\u2019t belong when what seems like an anomaly\nto them seems natural for everyone else. Over time, collectively, such\noutsider experiences (the quintessential stranger) can become monstrous\nin the collective imagination. History and literature are full of the demonizing\nof the stranger. Here is what Haraway (1992) has called \u2018the promise of\nmonsters\u2019 and one of the reasons that for years they have captured the\nfeminist imagination. Frankenstein peering in the warmly-lit living room\nwindow; Godzilla captured and shaking the bars of his cage are intuitions\nof exile and madness, and symbols of how women\u2019s resistance and wildness\nhas been imprisoned and reviled, kept just outside.\n<p>In a more formal sense, monsters and freaks are also ways of speaking\nabout the constraints of the classifying and (often) dichotomizing imagination.\nRitvo (1997) writes of the proliferation of monsters in the 18<sup>th</sup>\nand 19<sup>th</sup> century, linking it to a simultaneous increase in public\nawareness of scientific classification and hunger for the exotic. As classification\nschemes proliferated, so did monsters:\n<dir>\n<dir>Monsters were understood, in the first instance, as exceptions to\nor violations of natural law. The deviations that characterized monsters,\nhowever, were both so various and in some cases, so subtle as significantly\nto complicate this stock account\u2026. As a group, therefore, monsters were\nunited not so much by physical deformity or eccentricity as by their common\ninability to fit or be fitted into the category of the ordinary \u2013 a category\nthat was particularly liable to cultural and moral construction (Ritvo,\n1997: 133-134).</dir>\n</dir>\nIn a practical sense, this is a way to talk about what happens to any outsider.\nFor example, it could refer to experience in the science classroom when\nsomeone comes in with no experience of formal science, or to the transgendered\nperson who does not fit cultural gender dichotomies (Stone, 1991). It is\nnot simply a matter of the strangeness, but of the politics of the <i>mapping</i>\nbetween the anomalies and the forms of strangeness/marginality.\n<p>In accepting and understanding the monsters and the borderlands there\nmay be an intuition of healing and power, as Gloria Anzald&uacute;a (1987)\nshows us in her brilliant and compassionate writing. In her essay, \"La\nconscientia de la mestiza,\" the doubleness and the ambiguity of the male/female,\nstraight/gay, Mexican/American borderland becomes the cauldron for a creative\napproach to surviving, a rejection of simplistic purity and of essentialist\ncategories (1987). At the same time, she constantly remembers the physical\nand political suffering involved in these borderlands, refusing a romanticized\nversion of marginality that often plagued the early sociological writers\non the topic.\n<p>The path traced by Anzald&uacute;a is not an easy healing and certainly\nnot a magic bullet, but a complex and collective twisted journey, a challenge\nto easy categories and simple solutions. It is, in fact, a politics of\nambiguity and multiplicity -- this is the real possibility of the cyborg.\nFor scholars, this is necessarily an exploration that exists in interdisciplinary\nborderlands and crosses the traditional divisions between people, things,\nand technologies of representation.\n<p><b>Engineered vs. Organic Boundary Objects</b>\n<p>Would be possible actually to design boundary objects? To engineer them\nin the service of creating a better society? On the surface, this idea\nis tempting. In some sense, this has been the goal of progressive education,\nmulticulturalism in the universities, and, the goal of the design of information\nsystems that may be accessed by people with very different points of view.\n<p>Most schools now are lousy places to grow boundary objects, because\nthey both strip away the ambiguity of the objects of learning, and impose\nor ignore membership categories (except artificial hierarchically assigned\nones). In mass schooling and standardized testing, an attempt is made to\ninsist on an engineered community of practice, where the practices are\ndictated, and the naturalization process is monitored and regulated while\nignoring borderlands. They are virtual factories for monsters. In the 1970s\nand 1980s many attempts were made to <i>include</i> other communities in\nthe formula via affirmative action and multicultural initiatives. But where\nthese lacked the relational base between borderlands and the naturalization\nof objects, they ran aground on the idea of measuring progress in learning.\nThis is partly a political problem and partly a representational one. As\nfeminists learned so painfully over the years, a politics of identity based\non essences can only perpetuate vicious dualisms. That is, if one as a\nwhite male science teacher were to bring in an African American woman as\na (Platonic) representative of African American-ness and/or woman-ness,\nthen attempt to match her essential identity to the objects in the science\nclassroom (without attending much to how they are fully naturalized objects\nin <i>another</i> community of practice), costly and painful mismatches\nare inevitable. The teacher risks causing serious damage to her self-articulation\n(especially where she is alone), and her ability to survive (a look at\nthe dismal retention statistics of women and minority men in many sciences\nand branches of engineering will underscore this point). Any mismatch becomes\nher personal failure, since the measurement yardstick remains unchanged\nalthough the membership criteria seem to have been stretched. Again, both\nborderlands and anomalous objects have been deleted. Kal Alston (1993),\nwriting of her experience as an African-American Jewish feminist, has referred\nto herself as a unicorn -- a being at once mythical and unknowable, straddling\nmultiple worlds.\n<p>But <i>all</i> people belong to multiple communities of practice --\nit\u2019s just that in the case of the African-American woman in science, the\nvisibility and pressure is higher, and her experience is especially dense\nin the skill of surviving multiplicity. Thus Patricia Hill Collins\u2019 title,\n\"Learning from the Outsider Within\" has many layers and many directions\nto be explored as we all struggle for rich ways of mapping that honors\nthis experience and survival (1986). Karla Danette Scott (1995) has recently\nwritten about the interwoven languages of Black women coming to university,\nand how language becomes a resource for this lived complexity. They \u2018talk\nblack\u2019 and \u2018talk white\u2019 in a seamless, context-driven web, articulating\nthe tensions between those worlds as a collective identity. This is not\njust code switching, but braided identity, a borderland.\n<p><b>Wildness</b>\n<p>Things and people are always multiple, although that multiplicity may\nbe obfuscated by standardized inscriptions. In this sense, with the right\nangle of vision, things can be seen as heralds of other worlds, and of\na wildness that can offset our naturalizations in liberatory ways. Holding\nfirmly to a relational vision of people-things-technologies, in an ethical\npolitical framework, there is a chance to step off the infinite regress\nof measuring the consumption of an object naturalized in one centered world,\nsuch as the objects of Western science, against an infinitely-expanded\nset of essentially-defined members as consumers.\n<p>By relational here we argue against misplaced concretism, or a scramble\nunthinkingly to assimilate the experiences of things to pre-given categories.\nWe affirm the importance of process and ethical orientations. We also mean\nto take seriously the power of membership, its continual nature (i.e. we\nare never <i>not</i> members of some community of practice), and the inherent\nambiguity of things. Boundary objects, however, are not just about this\nambiguity, they are not just temporary solutions to disagreements about\nanomalies. Rather, they are durable arrangements between communities of\npractice. Boundary objects are the canonical forms of all objects in our\nbuilt and natural environments. Forgetting this, as people routinely do,\nmeans empowering the self-proclaimed objective voice of purity that creates\nthe suffering of monsters in borderlands. Due attention to boundary objects\nentails embracing the gentle and generous vision of <i>mestiza</i> consciousness\noffered by Anzald&uacute;a.\n<p><b>Casual vs. Committed Membership</b>\n<p>Another dimension to take into account here is the degree to which membership\ndemands articulation at the higher level. Being a woman and African American\nand disabled are three sorts of membership that are non-optional, diffused\nthroughout life, and embedded in almost every sort of practice and interaction.\nSo it\u2019s not equitable to talk about being a woman in the same breath as\nbeing a scuba diver -- although there are ways in which both can be seen\nunder the rubric community of practice. But if we go to the framework presented\nabove, there is a way to talk about it. To the extent that the joint objects\nare both multiply naturalized in conflicting ways and diffused through\npractices that belong to many communities they will pose a sticking point\nthat defies casual treatment. So for scuba diving -- it is primarily naturalized\nin a leisure world, and not especially central to any others. Its practice\nis restricted and membership is contained, neither contagious nor diffuse.\nOn the other hand, learning mathematics is multiply naturalized across\nseveral powerful communities of practice (mathematics and science teachers\nand practitioners); at the same time it is both strange and central to\nothers (central in the sense of a barrier to further progress). It is also\ndiffused through many kinds of practices, in various classrooms, disciplines\nand workplaces (Hall and Stevens, 1995). Some communities of practice expect\nit to be fully naturalized -- a background tool or a substrate/infrastructure\n-- in order to get on with the business of being, e.g. a scientist. (Lave\n1988). However, there is no map or sense of the strangeness of the object\nacross other memberships. Here, too, information technologies are both\ndiffused and strange, with rising expectations of literacy across worlds.\n<p>These relations define a space against which and into which information\ntechnologies of all sorts enter. These technologies of representation are\nentering into all sorts of communities of practice on a global scale, in\ndesign and in use. They are a medium of communication and broadcast, as\nwell as of standardization. The toughest problems in information systems\ndesign are increasingly those concerned with modeling cooperation across\nheterogeneous worlds, of modeling articulation work and multiplicity. If\nwe do not learn to do so, we face the risk of a franchised, dully standardized\ninfrastructure (\u2018500 channels and nothing on,\u2019 in Mitch Kapur\u2019s words),\nor of an Orwellian nightmare of surveillance.\n<p>Feminism and race-critical theory offer traditions of reflective denaturalization,\nof a politics of simultaneity and contradiction intuited by the term cyborg.\nLong ago feminists began with the maxim that the personal is political,\nand that each woman\u2019s experience has a primacy that we must all learn to\nafford. Feminism went from reductionist identity politics to cyborg politics\nin less than twenty years. Much of this was due to the hard work and suffering\nof communities of practice who had been made monstrous or invisible, especially\nwomen of color and their articulation of the layered politics of insider/outsider\nand borderlands. One part of the methodological lesson from feminism read\nin this way is that experience/experiment incorporates an ethics of ambiguity,\nwith both modesty and anger. This means that how we hear each other is\na matter of listening forth from silence -- listening is active, not passive;\nit means stretching to affiliate with multiplicity.<b> </b>In Nell Morton\u2019s\nwords, this is \"hearing to speech\":\n<ul>\n<li>\nNot only a new speech but a new hearing.</li>\n\n<li>\nHearing to speech is political</li>\n\n<li>\nHearing to speech is never one-sided. Once a person is heard to speech\nshe becomes a hearing person.</li>\n\n<li>\nSpeaking first to be heard is power over. Hearing to bring forth speech\nis empowering. (Morton, 1985: 210).</li>\n</ul>\nPart of the moral vision of this book concerns how we may, through challenge\nand analysis of infrastructure, better hear each other to speech.\n<p><b>5. Multiple Marginality, Multiple Naturalizations: Categorical Work</b>\n<p>The model proposed here takes the form of a many-to-many relational\nmapping, between multiple marginality of people (borderlands and monsters)\nand multiple naturalizations of objects (boundary objects and standards).\nOver time, the mapping is between the means by which individuals and collectives\nhave managed the work of creating coherent selves in the borderlands on\nthe one hand, and to create durable boundary objects on the other.\n<p>It is also not just many-to-many relational, but meta-relational. By\nthis we mean that the map must point simultaneously to the articulation\nof selves and the naturalization of objects. One of the things that is\nimportant here is honoring (we won\u2019t say capturing) the work involved in\nborderlands and boundary objects. This work is almost necessarily invisible\nfrom the point of view of any single community of practice: as Collins\n(1986) asks, what white really <i>sees</i> the work of self-articulation\nof the black who is juggling multiple demands/audiences/contingencies?\nIt is not just willful blindness (although it can be that), but much more\nakin to the blindness between different Kuhnian paradigms, a revolutionary\ndifference. Yet the juggling is both tremendously costly and brilliantly\nartful. Every community of practice has its overhead: <i>paying your dues,\nbeing regular, hangin\u2019, being cool, being professional, people like us</i>,\n<i>conduct\nbecoming</i>, <i>getting it, catching on</i> ... . And the more communities\nof practice one participates in, the higher the overhead -- not just in\na straightforwardly additive sense, but interactively. Triple jeopardy\n(i.e. being old, Black, and female) is not just three demographic variables\nor conditions added together, but a tremendously challenging situation\nof marginality requiring genius for survival. <i>The overheads interact.</i>\n<p><b>From Articulation Work to Categorical Work</b>\n<p>What is the name for this work of managing the overheads and anomalies\ncaused by multiple memberships on the one hand, and multiply naturalized\nobjects on the other? Certainly, it is invisible. Most certainly, it is\nmethodological, in the sense of reflecting on differences between methods\nand techniques. At first glance, it resembles articulation work, that is,\nwork done in real time to manage contingencies; work that gets things back\non track in the face of the unexpected, that modifies action to accommodate\nunanticipated contingencies. Within both symbolic interactionism and the\nfield of computer-supported cooperative work, the term articulation work\nhas been used to talk about some forms of this invisible juggling work\n(Schmidt and Bannon 1992; Gerson and Star 1986).\n<p>Articulation work is richly found for instance in the work of head nurses,\nsecretaries, homeless people, parents, and air traffic controllers, although\nof course all of us do articulation work in order to keep our work going.\nModeling articulation work is one of the key challenges in the design of\ncooperative and complex computers and information systems. This is because\nreal time contingencies, or in Suchman\u2019s (1987) terms, situated actions,\nalways change the use of any technology (for example, when the host of\na talk forgets to order a computer projector, can one quickly print out\nand assemble a handout?)\n<p>Other aspects of cooperative work concerns novelty and the ways in which\none person\u2019s routine may be another\u2019s emergency or anomaly (Hughes, 1970),\nor in the words of Schmidt and Simone (1996), both the consequences and\nthe division of labor of cooperative work. The act of cooperation is the\ninterleaving of distributed tasks; articulation work manages the <i>consequences</i>\nof this distributed aspect of the work. Schmidt and Simone note the highly\ncomplex dynamic and recursive relationship between the two -- managing\narticulation work can itself become articulation work, and vice versa,\nad infinitum.\n<p>The consequences of the distribution of work, and its different meanings\nin different communities, must be managed for cooperation to occur. The\njuggling of meanings (memberships and naturalizations), is what we term\n<i>categorical\nwork</i>. For example, what happens when one clerk, User A, entering data\ninto a large database does not think of abortion as a medical matter, but\nas a crime; while another, User B, thinks of it as a routine medical procedure?\nPerson A\u2019s definition excludes abortion from the medical database, Person\nB\u2019s includes it. The resulting data will be, at the least, incomparable,\nbut in ways that may be completely invisible to User C, compiling statistics\nfor a court case arguing for the legalization of abortion based on prevalence.\nWhen this aspect of the coordination of work is deleted and made invisible\nin this fashion, then voices are suppressed and we see the formation of\nmaster narratives and the myth of the mainstream universal (Star and Strauss,\n1999).\n<p>Thus, we can see categorical work as partly about managing the mismatches\nbetween memberships and naturalization. One way to think about this is\nthrough the management of anomalies -- as a tracer. Anomalies or interruptions,\nthe cause of contingency, come when some person or object, from outside\nthe world at hand, interrupts the flow of expectations. One reason that\nglass box technology or pure transparency is impossible is that anomalies\nalways arise when multiple communities of practice come together, and useful\ntechnologies cannot be designed in all communities at once. Monsters arise\nwhen the legitimacy of that multiplicity is denied. Our residual categories\nin that case become clogged and bloated.\n<p>Transparency is in theory the endpoint of the trajectory of naturalization,\nas complete legitimacy or centrality is the endpoint of the trajectory\nof membership in a community of practice. However, due to the multiplicity\nof membership of all people, and the persistence of newcomers and strangers,\nas well as the multiplicity of naturalization of objects, this is inherently\nnonexistent in the real world. For those brief historical moments where\nit seems to be the case, it is unstable.\n<p>In place of transparency \u2013 and it is a good enough counterfeit to work\nmost of the time as transparency \u2013 one encounters convergence: the mutual\nconstitution of a person or object and their representation. People get\nput into categories, and learn from those categories how to behave. Thus\nthere is the ironic observation that East Enders in London learn cockney\n(and how to be cockney) through watching the soap opera East Enders on\ntelevision: \"I am an East Ender therefore I must talk like this; and I\nmust drink such and such a brand of beer \u2026 \". Aided by bureaucratic institutions,\nsuch cultural features take on a real social weight. If official documents\nforce an Anglo-Australian, say, to choose one identity or the other; and\nif friends and colleagues encourage that person, for the convenience of\nsmall talk, to make a choice \u2013 then they are likely to become ever more\nAustralian: suffering alongside his or her now fellow-countrypeople if\nnew immigration measures are introduced in America or if \u2018we\u2019 lose a cricket\ntest. The same process occurs with objects \u2013 once a film has been thrown\ninto the X-rated bin, then there is a strong incentive for the director\nto make it <i>really</i> X-rated; once a house has been posted as condemned,\nthen people will feel free to trash it.\n<p>Where the difference lies between transparency and convergence is that\nwhere transparency ideally just produces a reflection of the way things\nreally are (and so, in Jullien\u2019s (1995) beautiful phrase captures the \u2018propensity\nof things\u2019 in any situation); convergence can radically break down \u2013 over\ntime or across geographical borders. When categories do break down in this\nfashion they leave no continuous trace back to the previous regime. So,\nfor instance, when the category of \u2018hysteric\u2019 became medically unfashionable,\nthen people with (what used to be called) hysteria were distributed into\nmultiple widely scattered categories. At that juncture, there was no point\nin their seeing the same doctors, or learning from each other what hysteria\nwas \u2026\n<p><b>Scaling Up: Generalization and Standards</b>\n<p>\"Similarity is an institution.\" --Mary Douglas (1986: 55)\n<p>In this whole complicated co-construction process, what are the things\nthat make objects and statuses seem given, durable, real? For, as Desrosi<font face=\"Times New Roman Special G1\">&Agrave;</font>\nres (1990) reminds us, partly through classification work, large scale\nbureaucracies are very good at making objects, people and institutions\nhold together. Some objects <i>are</i> naturalized in more than one world.\nThey are not then boundary objects, but rather they become <i>standards</i>\nwithin and across the multiple worlds in which they are naturalized. Much\nof mathematics, and in the West, much of medicine and physiology fits this\nbill. In the Middle Ages a lot of Christian doctrine fit this too. The\nhegemony of patriarchy arose from the naturalization of objects across\na variety of communities of practice, with the exclusion of women from\nmembership and the denial of our alternative interpretations of objects\n(Kramarae 1988; Merchant 1980; Croissant and Restivo, 1995).\n<p>When an object becomes naturalized in more than one community of practice,\nits naturalization gains enormous power -- to the extent that a basis is\nformed for dissent to be viewed as madness or heresy. It is also where\nideas like \"laws of nature\" get their power, because we are always looking\nto other communities of practice as sources of validity, and if as far\nas we can look we find naturalization the invisibility layers up and becomes\ndoubly, triply invisible. Sherry Ortner\u2019s (1974) classic essay on man:culture/woman:nature\nshows that this has held for the subjugation of women even where specific\ncultural circumstances vary widely, and her model of the phenomenon rests\non the persistent misunderstanding of borderlands and ambiguity in many\ncultures. Before her, Simone de Beauvoir (1948) wrote of the ethics of\nambiguity, showing the powerful negative consequences of settling for one\nnaturalized mode of interaction. We still need an ethics of ambiguity,\nstill more urgently with the pressure to globalize, and the integration\nof systems of representation through information technologies across the\nworld.\n<p>We have presented here a model of memberships, naturalizations, and\nthe work we do in managing their multiplicity. Further analysis is needed\nhere to examine different types of categorical work, and how they emerge\nunder different circumstances. In the next section, we continue with a\ndiscussion of categorization and pragmatism.\n<p><b>Boundary Infrastructure</b>\n<p>Any working infrastructure serves multiple communities of practice simultaneously\n\u2013 be these within a single organization or distributed across multiple\norganizations. A hospital information system, for example, has to respond\nto the separate as well as the combined agendas of nurses, records clerks,\ngovernment agencies, doctors, epidemiologists, patients and so forth. In\norder to do so, it must bring into play stable regimes of boundary objects\n\u2013 such that any given community of practice can interface with the information\nsystem and pull out the kinds of information objects that it needs.\n<p>Clearly boundary infrastructures are not perfect constructions. The\nchimera of a totally unified and universally applicable information system\n(still regrettably favored by many) should not be replaced by the chimera\nof a distributed, boundary-object driven information system fully respectful\nof the needs of the variety of communities it serves. To the contrary,\nas we saw in the case of NIC, nurses have needed to make a series of serious\nconcessions about the nature and quality of their data before hoping to\ngain any kind of entry into hospital information systems. As we have seen,\nthese difficulties generalize \u2013 though they are to some extent counterposed\nby processes of convergence.\n<p>Boundary infrastructures by and large do the work that is required to\nkeep things basically moving along. Because they deal in regimes and networks\nof boundary objects (and not of unitary, well-defined objects), boundary\ninfrastructures have sufficient play to allow for local variation together\nwith sufficient consistent structure to allow for the full array of bureaucratic\ntools (forms, statistics and so forth) to be applied. Even the most regimented\ninfrastructure is ineluctably also local: if workarounds are needed they\nwill be put into place. The ICD, for example, is frequently used to code\ncultural expectations (such as low heart attack rates in Japan) even though\nthese are nowhere explicitly part of the classification system.\n<p>What we gain with the concept of boundary infrastructure over the more\ntraditional unitary vision of infrastructures is the explicit recognition\nof the differing constitution of information objects within the diverse\ncommunities of practice which share a given infrastructure.\n<p><b>6. Future Directions: Texture and Modeling of Categorical Work and\nBoundary Infrastructures</b>\n<p><i>If you could say it, you would not need metaphor. If you could conceptualize\nit, it would not be metaphor. If you could explain it, you would not use\nmetaphor.</i> (Morton, 1985: 210)\n<p>So far in this chapter we have given a series of analytic categories\nwhich we hope will prove useful in the analysis and design of information\ninfrastructures. At the limit, as Nelle Morton points out, we arrive at\nthe sets of metaphors which people use to describe information networks\nof all kinds. These metaphors we live by are powerful means of organizing\nwork and intellectual practice. We will now look at one cluster of metaphors\n\u2013 centered on the concept of filiations \u2013 which we believe, offers promise\nfor future analytical work.\n<p><b>How are Categories Tied to People? : Filiations</b>\n<p>\"The frequency with which metaphors of weaving, threads, ropes and the\nlike appear in conjunction with contextual approaches to human thinking\nis quite striking.\" (Cole, 1996: 135)\n<p><i><font color=\"#3333FF\">filiation (fIlI\u2019eIS&amp;schwa.n).

(Oxford English\nDictionary, 2)</font></i>\n<p>Categories touch people in a variety of ways -- they are assigned, they\nbecome self-chosen labels, they may be statistical artifacts. They may\nbe visible or invisible to any other group or individual. We use the term\nfiliation here \u2013 related via Latin to the French \"fil\" for thread -- a\nthread that goes from a category to a person. This metaphor allows a rich\nexamination of the architecture of the multiple categories that touch people\u2019s\nlives. Threads carry a variety of textural qualities that are often applied\nto human interactions: tension, knottiness or smoothness, bundling, proximity,\nthickness. We select a small number here to focus on in the worked example\nbelow.\n<p><b>Loosely coupled \u2014 tightly coupled</b>\n<p>A category (or system of categories) may be loosely or tightly coupled\nwith a person. Gender and age are very tightly coupled with a person as\ncategories. One of the interesting aspects of the investigation of virtual\nidentities in MUDs and elsewhere on line is the loosening of these traditionally\ntightly coupled threads under highly constrained circumstances (e.g. Turkle,\n1994). Loosely coupled categories may be those that are transient, such\nas the color one is wearing on a given day or one\u2019s position in a waiting\nline. Somewhere in the middle are hair color, which may shift slowly over\na lifetime or change in an afternoon, or marital status.\n<p><b>Scope</b>\n<p>Categories\u2019 filiations have variable scope. Some are durable threads\nwhich cover many aspects of someone\u2019s identity and which are accepted as\nsuch on a very wide or even global scale. (Noting for the record that none\nare absolute, none cover all aspects of someone\u2019s identity, and there is\nno category, which is completely globally accepted.) The category alive\nor dead is quite thick and nearly global. So we can think of two dimensions\nof scope: thickness and scale. How thick is the individual strand: gossamer\nor thickest rope? With how many others is it shared?\n<p><b>What is its ecology?</b>\n<p>Classifications have habitats. That is, the filiations between person\nand category may be characterized as inhabiting a space or terrain with\nsome of the properties of any habitat. It may be crowded or sparse, peaceful\nor at war, fertile or arid. In order not to mix too many metaphors, two\nimportant questions about filiations and their ecology that may be visualized\nin threadlike terms are:\n<p>How many ties are there? That is, how many other categories are tied\nto this person, and in what density?\n<p>Do these threads contradict or complement (torque vs. boundary object\nof cooperation)? That is, are the threads tangled, or smoothly falling\ntogether?\n<p><b>Who controls the filiation?</b>\n<p>The question of who controls any given filiation is vital to an ethical\nand political understanding of information systems whose categories attach\nto individuals. A first crude characterization concerns whether the filiation\nwas chosen or imposed (an echo of the sociological standard, achieved or\nascribed); whether it may be removed and by whom; and under whose control\nand access is the apparatus to do so. Questions of privacy are important\nhere, as with medical information classifying someone with a social stigmatized\ncondition. The nature of the measure for the filiation here is important\nloci of control as well. For example, an IQ test may be an important way\nto classify people. People at some remove from those who take the test\ndeveloped it. The measure, IQ, is controlled from afar. Past criticisms\nof IQ tests charge that this control is racially biased and biased by gender,\non these grounds.\n<p><b>Is it reversible or irreversible?</b>\n<p>Finally, there is the important question of whether the filiation is\nreversible. The metaphor of branding someone is not accidental in this\nregard, branding meaning that a label is burned into the skin and completely\nirreversible. Some forms of filiation have this finality for the individual,\nregardless of how the judgment was later regarded (e.g. a charge of guilt\nfor murder may mean permanent public guilt regardless of a jury\u2019s verdict,\nas with the decades\u2019 long attempt of Sam Shepard\u2019s son to prove his father\u2019s\ninnocence). Many are somewhere between, but knowing how reversible is the\nfiliation is important for understanding its impact.\n<p>The metaphor of filiation presented here could be used to characterize\na texture of information systems where categories touch either individuals\nor things. The aesthetics of the weave and the degree to which the individual\nis bound up or supported by it are among the types of characterizations\nthat could be made. There are brute renderings, such as having two thick,\nirreversible threads tying one person to conflicting categories, as with\nthe examples above. More subtly, it is possible to think in terms of something\nlike Granovetter's strength of weak ties, and characterize the thousand\nand one classifications which weakly tie people to information systems\nas binding or torquing in another way.\n<p><font face=\"Times,Times New Roman\">To summarize. The metaphor of filiation\nis useful to the extent that it can be used to ask questions of working\ninfrastructures in new and interesting ways. Two questions that rise directly\nout or our treatment of the metaphor for any individual or group filiation\nare:</font>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<font face=\"Times,Times New Roman\">What will be the ecology and distribution\nof suffering?</font></li>\n\n<li>\n<font face=\"Times,Times New Roman\">Who controls the ambiguity and visibility\nof categories?</font></li>\n</ul>\n<b>Conclusion</b>\n<p>We have in this chapter argued that there is more to be done in the\nanalysis of classification systems than deconstructing universal master\nnarratives. Certainly, such narratives should be challenged. However, we\nhave attempted to show that there are ways of scaling up from the local\nto the social, via the concept of boundary infrastructures, and that we\ncan in the process recognize our own hybrid natures without losing our\nindividuality. The value of this approach is that it allows us to intervene\nin the construction of infrastructures - which surely exist and are powerful\n- as not only critics but also designers.\n<p><b>Chapter Ten: Why Classifications Matter</b>\n<p>Classifications are powerful technologies. Embedded in working infrastructures\nthey become relatively invisible without losing any of that power. In this\nbook we demonstrate that classifications should be recognized as the significant\nsite of political and ethical work that they are. They should be reclassified.\n<p>In the past 100 years, people in all lines of work have jointly constructed\nan incredible, interlocking set of categories, standards, and means for\ninter-operating infrastructural technologies. We hardly know what we have\nbuilt. No one is in control of infrastructure; no one has the power centrally\nto change it. To the extent that we live in, on, and around this new infrastructure,\nit helps form the shape of our moral, scientific and esthetic choices.\nInfrastructure is now the great inner space.\n<p>Ethnomethodologists and phenomenologists have shown us that what is\noften the most invisible is right under our noses. Everyday categories\nare precisely those that have disappeared -- into infrastructure, into\nhabit, into the taken for granted. These everyday categories are seamlessly\ninter-woven with formal, technical categories and specifications. As Cicourel\nnotes:\n<dir>\n<dir>The decision procedures for characterizing social phenomena are buried\nin implicit common sense assumptions about the actor, concrete persons,\nand the observer's own views about everyday life. The procedures seem intuitively\n\"right\" or \"reasonable\" because they are rooted in everyday life. The researcher\noften begins his classifications with only broad dichotomies, which he\nexpects his data to \"fit,\" and then elaborates on these categories if apparently\nwarranted by his \"data.\" (1964:21).</dir>\n</dir>\nThe hermeneutic circle is indeed all around us.\n<p>There is no simple unraveling of the built information landscape, or,\n<i>pace</i>\nZen practice, of unsettling our habits at every waking moment. Black boxes\nare necessary, and not necessarily evil. The moral questions arise when\nthe categories of the powerful become the taken for granted; when policy\ndecisions are layered into inaccessible technological structures; when\none group's visibility comes at the expense of another's suffering.\n<p>There are as well basic research questions implied by this navigation\ninto infrastructural space. Information technology operates through a series\nof displacements, from action to representation, from the politics of conflict\nto the invisible politics of forms and bureaucracy. Decades ago, Max Weber\nwrote of the iron cage of bureaucracy. Modern humans, he posited, are constrained\nat every juncture from true freedom of action by a set of rules of our\nown making. Some of these rules are formal, most are not. Information infrastructure\nadds another level of depth to the iron cage. In its layers, and in its\ncomplex interdependencies, it is a gossamer web, with iron at its core.\n<p>We have looked at several sets of classification schemes \u2013 the classifications\nof diseases, viruses, tuberculosis, race, and of nursing work. These are\nall examples of working classification systems: they are or have been maintained\nby organizations, governments and individuals. We have observed several\ndances between classifier and classified, but have nowhere seen either\nunambiguous entities waiting to be classified or unified agencies seeking\nto classify them. The act of classification is of its nature infrastructural,\nwhich means to say that it is both organizational and informational, always\nembedded in practice (Keller and Keller, 1996).\n<p>In our interviews of public health officials, nurses or scientists,\nwe have found that they recognize this about their own classification systems.\nAt the same time, there is little inducement to share problems across domains.\nBecause of the invisible work involved in local struggles with formal classification\nsystems and standards, a great deal of what sociologists would call \"pluralistic\nignorance\" obtains. This is the feeling that \"I am the only one\". People\noften have a picture that somehow their problems are unique: they believe\nthat other 'real' sciences do not have the same set of makeshift compromises\nand workarounds.\n<p>It is important in the development and implementation of classifications\n(and many related fields \u2013 such as the development and deployment of standards\nor archives) that we get out of the loop of trying to emulate a distant\nperfection that on closer analysis turns out to me just as messy as our\nown efforts. The importance lies in a fundamental rethinking of the nature\nof information systems. We need to recognize that all information systems\nare necessarily suffused with ethical and political values, modulated by\nlocal administrative procedures. These systems are active creators of categories\nin the world as well as simulators of existing categories. Remembering\nthis, we keep open and can explore spaces for change and flexibility that\nare otherwise lost forever.\n<p>Such politics are common to most systems employing formal representations.\nRogers Hall, in his studies of algebra problem solving by both children\nand professional math teachers, talks about the shame that children feel\nabout their unorthodox methods for arriving at solutions. Often using innovative\ntechniques such as imaginary devices, but not traditional formulaic means,\nthey achieved the right answer the wrong way. One child called this \"the\ndirt way.\" A grown-up version of the dirt way is related by the example\ngiven earlier of the \"good organizational reasons for bad organizational\nrecords\" (Bitner and Garfinkel, 1967). There are good organizational reasons\nfor working around formal systems; these adaptations are necessarily local.\nWhat is global is the need for them.\n<p>We have in this book attempted to develop tools for maintaining these\nopen spaces. Michel Serres has best expressed the fundamental ethical and\npolitical importance of this task. He has argued that the sciences are\nvery good at what they do: the task of the philosopher is to keep open\nand explore the spaces that otherwise would be left dark and unvisited\nbecause of their very success, since new forms of knowledge might arise\nout of these spaces. Similarly, we need to consistently explore what is\nleft dark by our current classifications ('other' categories) and design\nclassification systems that do not foreclose on rearrangements suggested\nby new forms of social and natural knowledge.\n<p>There are many barriers to this exploration. Not least among them is\nthe barrier of boredom. Delving into someone else's infrastructure as we\ndiscussed in the introduction, has about the entertainment value of reading\nthe white pages of the phone book. One does not encounter the dramatic\nstories of battle and victory, of mystery and discovery that make for a\ngood read.\n<p>In an introductory chapter, we laid the theoretical framework for the\ndiscussion of classification as an infrastructural practice, stressing\nthe political and ethical texturing of classification schemes. In Part\n1, we examined the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) as a\nlarge-scale long-term system ingrained in the work practices of multiple\norganizations and states. We argued that their organizational roots and\noperational exercise texture such systems. Such texture is an inescapable,\nappropriate feature of their constitution, and it is a feature that merits\nextended consideration in a discussion of the politics of infrastructure.\nIn Part 2, we looked at the intersection between classification and individual\nbiography in the case of the classification of tuberculosis and of race\nclassification under apartheid in South Africa. Generalizing the arguments\nmade in these chapters, we maintained that individuals in the modern State\noperate within multiple classification systems \u2013 from the small-scale,\nsemi-negotiated system as with the informal classification of tuberculosis\npatients negotiated with doctors up to enforced universal systems such\nas race classification. We drew attention to the torquing of individual\nbiographies as people encounter these reified classifications. Finally,\nwe examined classification and work practice, taking the example of the\nclassification of nursing work. We argued that multiple tensions between\nrepresentation and autonomy, disability and discretion, forgetting the\npast and learning its lessons make such classifications a key site of political\nand professionalization work. We are all called upon to justify our productivity\nwhen we are embedded in complex modern organizations. The dilemma faced\nby nurses in accounting for their work is on the present in the modern\norganization. Even children are not exempt.\n<p>We have seen throughout this book that people (and the information systems\nthey build) routinely conflate formal and informal, prototypical and Aristotelian\naspects of classification. There is no such thing as an unambiguous, uniform\nclassification system (indeed the deeper one goes into the spaces of classification\nexpertise \u2013 for example librarianship or botanical systematics \u2013 the more\nperfervid one finds the debates between rival classificatory schools).\nThis in turn means that there is room in the constitution of any classification\nsystem with organizational and political consequences - and few schemes\nif any are without such dimensions \u2013 for technical decisions about the\nscheme to systematically reflect given organizational and political positions.\nSince, then, we are dealing with an agonistic field, there will be no pure\nreflection of a single position, but rather dynamic tensions between multiple\npositions. And finally, since the classification system is not a pure reflection\nof such positions (an impossible aim in its own right \u2013 no classification\nsystem can reflect either the social or the natural world fully accurately)\nbut also integrally a tool for exploring the real world, there is no simple\nprediction from how a given set of alliances or tensions leads invariably\nto a given classification used in a given way.\n<p>As sets of classification systems coalesce into working infrastructures\nthey become integrated into information systems of all sorts. Thus we have\nargued throughout this book that information systems design should be informed\nby organizational and political analysis at this level. We are not offering\nthis as an <i>ex cathedra</i> design principle. Rather, we have \u2013 along\nwith many researchers in the field of social informatics - demonstrated\nempirically that invisible organizational structures influence the design\nand use of systems: the question is not whether or not this occurs but\nrather <i>how</i> to recognize, learn from and plan for the ineluctable\npresence of such features in working infrastructures. We have suggested\none design aid here: long term and detailed ethnographic and historical\nstudies of information systems in use, so that we can build up an analytic\nvocabulary appropriate to the task.\n<p>Working infrastructures contain multiple classification systems, which\nare both invisible, in the senses above, and ubiquitous. The invisibility\nof infrastructure makes visualization or description difficult. The metaphors\nwe reached for to describe infrastructure are ironic and somehow childish.\nWe speak of \"way down in the underwear,\" \"underneath the system,\" or use\nup/down metaphors such as \"runs under,\" or \"runs on top of.\" Lakoff and\nJohnson (1980) write of metaphors we live by. Our infrastructural metaphors\nshow how baffled we often are by these systems. They are like undergarments,\nor tunnel dwellers.\n<p>Another set of metaphors often used in organizations speaks indirectly\nto the experience of infrastructure. These are the metaphors of texture,\nomnipresent in human relationships. Texture metaphors speak to the densely\npatterned interaction of infrastructures and the experience of living in\nthe \"classification society.\" Texture speaks to the way that classifications\nand standards link the individual with larger processes and structures.\nThese links generate both enabling/constraining patterns over a set of\nsystems (texture), and developmental patterns for an individual operating\nwithin a given set (trajectory). Thus we have used the metaphor of the\ntexture of a classification system to explore the fact that any given classification\nprovides surfaces of resistances (where the real resist its definition),\nblocks against certain agendas and smooth roads for others. Within this\nmetaphorical landscape, the individual's trajectory \u2013 often, for all that,\nperceived as continuous and self-consistent \u2013 is at each moment twisted\nand torqued by classifications and vice versa.\n<p>Therefore we have, through our analysis of various classification systems,\nattempted to provide a first approximation to an analytic language which\nrecognizes that the architecture of classification schemes is simultaneously\na moral and an informatic one. This book has brought to light as crucial\nto the design process the reading of classification schemes as political\nand cultural productions. We have stressed that any classification scheme\ncan be read in this fashion. We initially deliberately eschewed cases like\nDSM-IV, where categories have often already become explicit objects of\npolitical contention, such as \"homosexual\" or \"pre-menstrual tension.\"\nIn the psychiatric case, there can in this sense often be a more direct\nread-off from political exigencies to disease categories. Although such\nreadings are of course highly valuable in their own right (see Kirk and\nKutchins, 1992; Kutchins and Kirk, 1997 and Figert, 1996), we first took\nthe more muted cases posed by the ICD, where the politics were quieter.\nThis we hoped would show the generalizability of the thesis that all category\nsystems are moral and political entities. This was balanced later in the\nvolume with an analysis of the much more obviously politically laden categories\ngenerated by the pro-apartheid government and its scientific apologists.\n<p>This book has implications for both designers and users (and we are\nall increasingly both) of complex information spaces. It provides intellectual\nand methodological tools for recognizing and working with the ethical and\npolitical dimensions of classification systems. In particular we have underlined\nseveral design exigencies, that speak both to the architecture of information\nsystems encoding classification systems and to their development and change:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>Recognizing the balancing act of classifying.</i> Classification schemes\nalways represent multiple constituencies. They can do so most effectively\nthrough the incorporation of ambiguity \u2013 leaving a certain terms open for\nmultiple definitions across different social worlds: they are in this sense\nboundary objects. Designers must recognize these zones of ambiguity, protecting\nthem where necessary in order to leave free play for the schemes to do\ntheir organizational work.</li>\n\n<li>\n<i>Rendering voice retrievable.</i> As classification systems get ever\nmore deeply embedded into working infrastructures they risk getting black-boxed\nand thence made both potent and invisible. By keeping the voices of classifiers\nand their constituents present, the system can retain maximum political\nflexibility. This includes the key ability to be able to change with changing\nnatural, organizational and political imperatives. A caveat here, drawn\nfrom Chapter 7's lesson about the invisibility of nursing work: we are\nnot simply celebrating visibility, or naively proposing a populist agenda\nfor the empire of classification. Visibility is not an unmitigated good.\nRather, by retrievability, we are suggesting that under many circumstances,\nthe \"rule by no one\" or the \"iron cage of bureaucracy\" is strengthened\nby its absence. When classification systems and standards acquire inertia\nbecause they are part of invisible infrastructure, the public is <i>de\nfacto</i> excluded from policy participation.</li>\n\n<li>\n<i>Being sensitive to exclusions.</i> We have in particular drawn attention\nhere to the distribution of residual categories (who gets to determine\nwhat is other). Classification systems always have 'other' categories,\nto which actants (entities or people) who remain effectively invisible\nto the scheme are assigned. A detailed analysis of these others throws\ninto relief the organizational structure of any scheme (Derrida, 1998).\nResidual categories have their own texture that operates like the silences\nin a symphony to pattern the visible categories and their boundaries.</li>\n</ul>\nStewart Brand's (1994) wonderful book, <i>How Buildings Learn</i>, gives\nmany examples of how buildings get designed as they are used as much as\non the architect's drawing-board. Thus a house with a balcony and numerous\ncurlicues around the roof will become a battened-down square fortress block\nunder the influence of a generation of storms from the northeast. Big single-family\nmansions become apartment buildings as a neighborhood's finances change.\nThese criteria generalize to classification systems. Through these three\ndesign criteria we are drawing attention to the fact that architecture\nbecomes archaeology over time. This in turn may become a cycle.\n<p>Overall, we have argued that classifications are a key part of the standardization\nprocesses that are themselves the cornerstones of working infrastructures.\nPeople have always navigated sets of classification spaces. Mary Douglas\n(1984), among others, has drawn attention to this feature of all societies\nfrom the indigenous and tribal to the most 'industrialized. Today, with\nthe emergence of new information infrastructures, these classification\nsystems are becoming ever more densely interconnected. This integration\nbegan roughly in the 1850s, coming to maturity in the late 19<font size=-2>th</font>\ncentury with the flourishing of systems of standardization for international\ntrade and epidemiology. Local classification schemes (of diseases, nursing\nwork, viruses\u2026) are now increasingly giving way to these standardized international\nschemes which themselves are being aligned with other large scale information\nsystems. In this process, it is becoming easier for the individual to act\nand perceive him or her self as a completely naturalized part of the \"classification\nsociety,\" since this thicket of classifications is both operative (defining\nthe possibilities for action) and descriptive. As we are socialized to\nbecome that which can be measured by our increasingly sophisticated measurement\ntools, the classifications increasingly naturalize across wider scope.\nOn a pessimistic view, we are taking a series of increasingly irreversible\nsteps towards a given set of highly limited and problematic descriptions\nof what the world is and how we are in the world.\n<p>For these reasons, we have argued in this book that it is politically\nand ethically crucial to recognize the vital role of infrastructure in\nthe \"built moral environment.\" Seemingly purely technical issues like how\nto name things and how to store data in fact constitutes much of human\ninteraction, and much of what we come to know as natural. We have argued\nthat a key for the future is to produce flexible classifications, whose\nusers are aware of their political and organizational dimensions, and which\nexplicitly retain traces of their construction. In the best of all possible\nworlds, at any given moment the past could be reordered to better reflect\nmultiple constituencies now and then. Only thus we will be able to fully\nlearn the lessons of the past. In this same optimal world, we could tune\nour classifications to reflect new insitutional arrangements or personal\ntrajectories - reconfigure the world on the fly. The only good classification\nis a living classification.\n<p><i>Envoi</i>\n<p>We would hate to have to assign a Dewey classification number to this\nbook, which straddles sociology, anthropology, history and information\nsystems, and design. Our modest hope is that it will not find its way onto\nthe fantasy shelves\u2026.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
