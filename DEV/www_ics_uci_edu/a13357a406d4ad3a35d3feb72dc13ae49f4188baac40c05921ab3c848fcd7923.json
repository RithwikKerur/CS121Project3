However, Java also enables a way to write Applets which are programs \r\n\t\t\tthat run through a browser. For this lab warm-up you can learn how to create \r\n\t\t\tjava applets and incorporate them into a webpage. The applet you will compile \r\n\t\t\tand use is the blinking text applet above. This will also get you familiar with \r\n\t\t\twhatever java programming environment you choose to use so you can just start \r\n\t\t\ton the first programming assignment next week with all these details worked \r\n\t\t\tout.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tFor this lab you should turn in the java applet you designed and a link to a \r\n\t\t\twebpage with this applet running. To turn in it, log in to the <a href=\"http://eee.uci.edu/\">\r\n\t\t\t\tUCI Electronic Educational Environment</a>, and upload (1) your applet and \r\n\t\t\t(2) a link to your webpage.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<h3>\r\n\t\t\tGetting Accounts</h3>\r\n\t\tIn order to do this lab, you will need two different accounts: your Windows \r\n\t\taccount and and a UNIX account. The Windows account is the one you will \r\n\t\tprimarily be using for this class. The UNIX account will be important for \r\n\t\thaving your web page and will provide some disk space for you to save files. \r\n\t\tInstructions for getting your accounts can be found at <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/\">\r\n\t\t\thttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/ </a>.\r\n\t\t<h3>\r\n\t\t\tAccessing Files</h3>\r\n\t\tThe icon labeled <em>youruserid on `octavian'(H:) </em>is your file system on \r\n\t\tthe Suns. All your files on your Sun account can be accessed through your \r\n\t\tWindows account by clicking on this icon. For the machines in the lab, you can \r\n\t\tnot write to any files on the hard drive (labelled <strong>C: </strong>) except \r\n\t\tfor the folder <strong>C:\\temp </strong>. I recommend storing all the files you \r\n\t\tare working on in your Sun account. However, while you are working on them, \r\n\t\tmove them over to <strong>C:\\temp </strong>.\r\n\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t<h3>\r\n\t\t\tSave and Compile the Applet Source Code</h3>\r\n\t\tSave the source code for the blinking applet using the source code above. \r\n\t\tCompile the the source code using whatever programming environment you choose \r\n\t\tto use. Detailed instructions on how to do this using BlueJ are given below. \r\n\t\tAtfer you have compiled the code, you will have a class called <em>Blink.class </em>\r\n\t\t.\r\n\t\t<h3>\r\n\t\t\tMaking a web page\r\n\t\t</h3>\r\n\t\tIn order to have a web page that is publicly viewable, it needs to reside in a \r\n\t\tspecial directory on your Unix account. You also need to take care to have the \r\n\t\tprotection on the directory and files set so that they can be accessed. For a \r\n\t\tquick tutorial on some Unix basics, visit <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/unix\">\r\n\t\t\thttp://www.ics.uci.edu/computing/unix </a>, but the following list of \r\n\t\tcommands should be enough for this lab:\r\n\t\t<OL>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\tTelnet/logon to your Unix account<li>Make a directory called <b>public_html</b> under \r\n\t\t\t\tthe root directory\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcd<li>mkdir public_html\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tChange the mode of the <b>public_html</b> directory to be world-readable and \r\n\t\t\t\tworld-executable.\r\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcd<li>chmod 755 public_html\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tCreate a web page. Call it <em>index.html </em>and store it in your public_html \r\n\t\t\t\tdirectory.

You can use \r\n\t\t\t\tthe <em>make_my_web </em>\r\n\t\t\tprogram or get more creative on your own.<li>\r\n\t\t\t\tCopy your <em>Blink.class </em>file to your public_html directory.

Note that you can save the web page you \r\n\t\t\t\tare reading and view it using Notepad to see how this is done. You need the \r\n\t\t\t\tlines inbetween the <strong>&lt;hr&gt; </strong>\r\n\t\t\tcommands.<li>Test your Applet by going to the URL <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~Your-Login-Name\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\thttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~Your-Login-Name</A>.\r\n\t\t\t<LI>\r\n\t\t\t\tChange the java applet we give you in some creative way.&nbsp; After all, this \r\n\t\t\t\tis your UCI webpage now, so you dont want it to be lame...</LI></OL>\r\n\t\t<h3>\r\n\t\t\tCreating a Project through BlueJ\r\n\t\t</h3>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tJava Applets are programs that can be run through a web browser. This section \r\n\t\t\twill guide you through two different ways of running an Applet: through a web \r\n\t\t\tbrowser or through BlueJ. In order to run any program or Applet through BlueJ, \r\n\t\t\tyou have to first create a project and put the appropriate files in the \r\n\t\t\tproject. This is something that is required by BlueJ, and is its way of \r\n\t\t\torganizing files for a particular application.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tStart out by opening up BlueJ through the <strong>Start </strong>menu. ( All \r\n\t\t\tthe machines in the lab already have BlueJ installed. If you would like to \r\n\t\t\tinstall BlueJ on your own computer visit <a href=\"http://www.bluej.org/\">http://www.bluej.org\r\n\t\t\t</a>. ) Since we are creating a new project, pull down the <strong>Projects </strong>\r\n\t\t\tmenu in BlueJ and choose <strong>New Project</strong>. Select the location \r\n\t\t\twhere you want your project to reside and give your project a name. This will \r\n\t\t\tcreate a folder with that name and two additional files in the folder.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tTo run a Java Applet through a web browser, you will need at least two \r\n\t\t\tdifferent files: an <em>html </em>file and at least one file containing the \r\n\t\t\tJava bytecode for the applet. The name of the <em>html </em>file will always \r\n\t\t\thave the extension <em>.html </em>and the names of the files containing the \r\n\t\t\tJava bytecode will always have the extension <em>.class </em>. The <em>.class </em>\r\n\t\t\tfile is created by compiling Java source code which will be stored in files \r\n\t\t\tending in <em>.java </em>. Copy the <em>Blink.java </em>file into your project \r\n\t\t\tfolder.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tIf we want to run the Applet through BlueJ, we need to add the new Java source \r\n\t\t\tfile to the project. From the Edit menu in BlueJ, select <strong>Add Class From \r\n\t\t\t\tFile</strong>. Select <em>Blink.java </em>and click <strong>Add </strong>. \r\n\t\t\tA box with the name of the applet (Blink) will appear in your window. Click on \r\n\t\t\tthe <strong>Compile </strong>button to compile the project. This will produce a \r\n\t\t\tfile called <em>Blink.class </em>in the project folder which is the Java \r\n\t\t\tbytecode for the applet.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\tTo run the applet, right click on the box with Blink applet and select <strong>Run \r\n\t\t\tApplet </strong>. You can run the applet through the applet viewer or the \r\n\t\tweb browser. Experiment with both. For now, select one and click <strong>OK </strong>\r\n\t\t. When you run the Applet, BlueJ automatically produces an html file that \r\n\t\tpoints to the bytecode file for that applet.\r\n\t\t<p></p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tIf you right click on the Blink applet and select <strong>Open Editor </strong>you \r\n\t\t\tcan edit the java source code. You will need to do this when you develop your \r\n\t\t\town Java programs. Go in and edit the text that is blinking in the applet.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\tGo back to the folder containing the files for your project. If you \r\n\t\t\tdouble-click on the <em>Blink.html </em>file, your browser will open and \r\n\t\t\tdisplay your new applet. If you open the html file with a text editor, you can \r\n\t\t\tsee and edit the html file. Note the line that points to the Blink.class file. \r\n\t\t\tThis tells the browser to execute this bytecode.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\t</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
