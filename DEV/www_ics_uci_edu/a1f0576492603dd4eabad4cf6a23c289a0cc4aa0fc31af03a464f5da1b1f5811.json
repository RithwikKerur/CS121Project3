We have been able to build a\nvariety of interesting applications with NSTP, and the design seems to\nrepresent a good tradeoff in terms of simplicity, power, and reliability.\nWe initially thought that a colleague awareness tool (colloquially, a\n\"buddy list\") was just another synchronous groupware application.  However,\nas users requested more capabilities, we learned that awareness\napplications have a different underlying model of social interaction from\nour other, quasi-meeting, applications. Accordingly, we designed the Simple\nGeneral Awareness Protocol (SGAP) to address the problems that arise in\nsophisticated awareness applications.\n \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
