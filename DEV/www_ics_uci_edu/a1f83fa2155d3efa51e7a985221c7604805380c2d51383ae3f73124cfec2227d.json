These examples are mostly to give you clean and well-documented examples of some of the things we cover in lecture (and possibly a few things that we don't, time permitting), so that you can be free in lecture to avoid trying to take detailed notes when we're writing code together, instead concentrating on understanding the process and the bigger-picture concepts at work when we develop the examples.</p>\n\n<table class=\"normal\">\n  <tr class=\"top\">\n    <td>Lecture Date(s)</td>\n    <td>Description</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Th 4/1</td>\n    <td><a href=\"GUILayoutAndEventHandling.zip\">Our example of GUI layout and event handling in Swing</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tu 4/6<br />\n        Th 4/8</td>\n    <td><a href=\"GUI2_JPanels_NestedLayout_ModelSeparation_CustomEvents.zip\">The second GUI example, including JPanels and nested layout, model/view separation, and custom events &mdash; five progressively improved versions</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Th 4/8<br />\n        Tu 4/13</td>\n    <td><a href=\"GUI3_GridBagLayouts_JLists_ListModels.zip\">The \"names list\" example of GridBagLayout, JLists, ListModels, along with some extensions we didn't implement in lecture</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Th 4/15</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Sockets1_SimpleClientAndServer.zip\">A simple chat server and client using sockets</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tu 4/20</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Sockets2_ChatWithProtocolSeparation.zip\">Improving our chat server and client using protocol separation</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Th 4/22</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Sockets3_GUIWithSimpleSockets.zip\">Mixing sockets with GUIs, including the use of threads to keep the GUI responsive</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tu 4/27</td>\n    <td><a href=\"IO1_FileIntoByteArray.zip\">Reading the bytes in a file into a byte array</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tu 4/27</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Sockets4_BytesAndSockets.zip\">Sending bytes through a socket (which is surprisingly similar to reading them from the file)</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Th 4/29</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Web1_DownloadingWebPages.zip\">Downloading a web page via a Java program</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Th 4/29</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Web2_PostingTwitterUpdates.zip\">Using the Twitter API to post Twitter updates from a Java program</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tu 5/4</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Web3_FetchingTwitterTimeline.zip\">Fetching a Twitter timeline using the Twitter API, including parsing its XML response</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Th 5/6</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Web4_UsingLibrariesOtherThanTheJavaLibrary.zip\">Issuing a Google query from a Java program, including using open source software to parse the JSON response</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tu 5/11<br />\n        Th 5/13<br />\n        Tu 5/18</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Othello.zip\">The complete Othello game (more or less) that we built in lecture</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Th 5/20<br />\n        Tu 5/25</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Animation1_BallMovement.zip\">Our first animation, a ball bouncing around an empty area</a></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>Tu 5/25<br />\n        Th 5/27</td>\n    <td><a href=\"Animation2_AnimationBecomesGame.zip\">Adding a paddle and turning our animation into a simple game, including sound</a></td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<br />\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">How to use these examples in Eclipse</p>\n\n<p>Here's what you'll want to do in order to pull each example into Eclipse.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Each example is presented in a <b>src</b> folder that contains all of its source code, arranged into folders to match its package hierarchy.</li>\n  <li>Open your Eclipse workspace.  You might want to use a separate workspace for the code examples, or you might prefer to mix them into the workspace that contains the work you're doing on your projects.</li>\n  <li>Create a new Java project, with any name you'd like.  You'll find that you're much better off with clear project names, so you can find them as you start to accumulate a large number of them.  (If you mix the code examples with your project work, you might want to prefix all of the example projects with a word like <b>Example</b>, so you can tell the examples apart from your own work at a glance.)</li>\n  <li>Download and unzip the example somewhere temporarily.</li>\n  <li>Copy the <b>src</b> folder into the new project's folder within your workspace folder, replacing the old (empty) <b>src</b> folder.</li>\n  <li>Right-click the project in Project Explorer in Eclipse and select Refresh.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>After taking these steps, the example should be available in Eclipse!</p>\n\n<p>Note that Eclipse will collapse a large comment that I've written at the top of each .java file, so that you can only see the first line of it.  You'll want to be sure to expand these comments (by clicking the little + next to them) and read them, because that's where a lot of the useful information is.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
