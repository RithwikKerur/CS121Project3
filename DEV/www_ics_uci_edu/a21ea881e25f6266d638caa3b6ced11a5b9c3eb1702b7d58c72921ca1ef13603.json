Plucker coordinates are\ncoordinates for this manifold.  The construction is to note that if a\nprojective coordinate system is fixed for the n-dimensional projective space,\nthen an m-dimensional subspace is determined by m+1 independent points x(0), .\n. ., x(m).  Each of these points can be considered as an n+1-tuple indexed\nfrom 0 to n (the projective coordinates.)  So for each set of m+1 distinct\nintegers 0 &lt;= i0 &lt; i1 &lt; . . . &lt; im &lt;= n one can form the determinant\n\n     | x(0)(i0) x(0)(i1)  .  .  .  x(0)(im) |\n     | x(1)(i0) x(1)(i1)  .  .  .  x(1)(im) |\n     |    .        .      .  .  .      .    |\n     |    .        .      .  .  .      .    |\n     | x(m)(i0) x(m)(i1)  .  .  .  x(m)(im) |\n\nThe tuple of all such determinants (with the canonical ordering) represents\nthe subspace.  This tuple provides homogeneous coordinates (i.e. two which\ndiffer only by a scalar multiple are identified) which are independent of the\nparticular choice on independent points in the subspace.  These coordinates\nare called Plucker (or Grassmann) coordinates.\n\nThe individual components of the Plucker coordinates of a point in this\nGrassmann space are not independent - there is the Plucker relation which is\nessentially a restatement of expansion by minors.\n\nThese were used extensively in the \"classical\" study of projective algebraic\ngeometry.  For example it is an immediate consequence of the existence of\nPlucker coordinates that the space of lines in projective 3-space can be\nidentified with a quadric surface in projective 5-space.\n\nStrangely enough I can no longer remember where I learned this stuff and the\nonly reference I know is\n\nC. Chevalley, Fundamental Concepts of Algebra\nAcademic Press, 1956.  pp. 201-203\n\nwhich uses them to parametrize exterior algebras.\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
