If all faces of the graph are \ntriangles, the realizations are unique up to\n<A HREF=\"inversion.html\">inversion</A>: one can get from \nany realization to any other by a sequence of inversions.  This uniqueness \nproperty is closely related to Mostov rigidity of hyperbolic manifolds.\n\n<P>The circles below represent the skeleton of an octahedron, a planar \ngraph with six vertices and twelve edges.  Therefore there are six (blue) \ncircles, each tangent to four others.  The red arcs form a drawing of the \ngraph itself.  The red circles are also the\n<A HREF=\"bisector.html\">bisectors</A> for the three pairs of nontangent circles,\nand also pass through the tangencies of three rings of\n<A HREF=\"four-circles.html\">four tangent circles</A>,\neach of which forms an instance of\n<A HREF=\"steiner.html\">Steiner's porism</A>.\nThe orthogonal circles through each triple of\n<A HREF=\"three-circles.html\">three mutually tangent circles</A>\n(not shown) are the eight\n<A HREF=\"apollonian.html\">Apollonian circles</A> of the three red circles\nand form a realization of the planar dual graph, a cube.\n\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER>\n<applet code     = \"de.cinderella.CindyApplet\"\n        archive = \"cindyrun.jar\"\n        width    = 630\n        height   = 350>\n<param  name=kernelID  value=\"931072501971\">\n<param  name=viewport value=\"de.cinderella.ports.EuclideanPort\">\n<param  name=filename value=\"octahedron.cdy\">\n<param  name=polar value= \"false\">\n<param  name=width value= \"630\">\n<param  name=height value=\"350\">\n<param  name=doublebuffer value= \"true\">\n<param  name=mesh value=\"false\">\n<param  name=axes value=\"false\">\n<param  name=snap value=\"false\">\n<param  name=scale value=\"25.0\">\n<param  name=originx value=\"210\">\n<param  name=originy value= \"233\">\n<param  name=deltafactor value= \"0\">\n<param  name=pref0 value=\"cinderella.defaults.background=255,255,255\">\n<IMG SRC=\"octahedron.gif\" WIDTH=567 HEIGHT=349\nALT=\"Circle realization of octahedron skeleton\"><BR>\n<SMALL>If you were running Java, you'd see a nice animation instead of this \ngif.</SMALL>\n</applet>\n</DIV>\n\n<P>Warren Smith has found fast algorithms for approximating the locations \nof a circle realization of a graph, but finding exact locations seems to be \ncomputationally difficult (in that it involves finding the roots of \nhigh-degree polynomials, while standard models of exact computation assume \nonly the ability to handle bounded degree).  The examples on these pages \nwere all compass-and-straightedge constructible, but some Koebe embeddings \nare not.  For instance, any realization of the heptagonal bipyramid\n(i.e., a seven-circle <A HREF=\"steiner.html\">Steiner \nporism</A>) could be used to construct a regular heptagon (known to be \nimpossible) since seven circles through triples of its tangencies meet at \na common point and form angles of pi/7 there.\n\n<P>Finally, it seems to be unknown which nonplanar graphs can be realized as tangencies \nof (non-disjoint) circles.  Any set of disjoint circles has a circle with \ndegree at most five, but nondisjoint circles can have arbitrary degree (for \ninstance, any hypercube skeleton can be realized).  A better \ncharacterization of these graphs might shed some light on the question we \n<A HREF=\"index.html\">started with</A>, Ringel's problem of bounding their \nchromatic number.\n\n<P><HR><P>\nAnimation created by <A HREF=\"http://www.cinderella.de/\">Cinderella</A>.<BR>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"octahedron.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
