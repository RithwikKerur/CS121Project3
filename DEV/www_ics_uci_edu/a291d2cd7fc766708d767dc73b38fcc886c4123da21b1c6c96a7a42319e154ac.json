The 4-cube has 16 corners,\nso you cut off 8 simplices this way.\n\nWhat's the shape of the piece left over in the middle?  It has 8\ntetrahedral faces (where you cut off a corner of the cube), and some\nmore faces (subsets of the original faces of the cube you started with).\nThe 4-cube has 8 faces, and after you cut the corners off these faces\nturn into regular tetrahedra.  So the left over piece has 16\nregular-tetrahedron faces.  It's one of the six regular 4-polytopes, the\n16-cell!\n\nThe 16-cell is easiest to visualize with the help of a Schlegel diagram:\nform a regular tetrahedron in 3-space, and nest inside it a regular\ntetrahedron in the opposite orientation (so that each vertex of the\ninner tetrahedron is near the middle of a face of the outer\ntetrahedron), think of the inner tetrahedron as being opaque and the\nouter one as being transparent, and connect every pair of inner and\nouter vertices that can see each other.  Two of the faces of the 16-cell\nare the tetrahedra you started with.  Eight more are formed by\nconnecting a face of one tetrahedron to a vertex of the other, and the\nremaining six connect an edge of one tetrahedron to an edge of the\nother.\n\nTo finish the 4-cube's triangulation, just connect one of the 16-cell's\nvertices with each of the opposite faces.  Each vertex is opposite 8\nfaces of the 16-cell (because the other 8 faces touch the vertex, as you\ncan see from the Schlegel diagram).  So this step forms 8 more\nsimplices, which added to the 8 corners you cut off give a total of 16.\n\nIt isn't so simple to extend this idea to higher dimensions.  E.g., if\nyou cut off every other corner of a 5-cube, you get a non-regular\npolytope, with 16 4-simplex faces and 10 16-cell faces.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A> <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             John Kasdan &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:kasdan@columbia.edu\">kasdan@columbia.edu</A>&gt;\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Triangulation of cubes\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 6 Jan 1999 09:40:25 -0800 (PST)\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nJohn Kasdan writes:\n &gt; He may well have, but my newfeed hasn't gotten it yet.
