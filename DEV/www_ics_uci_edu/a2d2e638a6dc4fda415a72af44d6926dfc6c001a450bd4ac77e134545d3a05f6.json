In order to use it, you first have to activate your UCInetID if you haven't already.  UCI provides all its students with basic computing, including electronic mail and other Internet services, via a \"UCInetID\" computer account.  Instructions for activating this account are available from several sources, but perhaps the easiest way is to activate your account on-line at <a href=\"http://activate.uci.edu/\">activate.uci.edu</a>.  All ICS 23 students need this account, both for using Checkmate, and also so that the course staff can email you when necessary.  If you have not activated your UCInetID, do so immediately.</p>\n\n<p>To use Checkmate once you've activated your UCInetID, all you need to do is go to <a href=\"http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/\">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a>, log in using your UCInetID, and follow the instructions there.  (If you get a message about security certificates, just click \"Continue.\")</p>\n\n<p>If you have any reason to believe that the system isn't working as\nyou believe it should, read the instructions carefully, try it a\nsecond time, and if you're still having difficulty, send <a\nhref=\"mailto:thornton@ics.uci.edu\">Alex Thornton</a> an email describing the problem as precisely as possible.  If you keep us informed about problems in a timely way, we will make sure that any problems with Checkmate won't affect your grade.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"history\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ul class=\"nomarker\">\n  <li>Adapted from the ICS 22 Summer 2002 version of this document by Alex Thornton to reflect the exclusive use of Checkmate, Fall 2002.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
