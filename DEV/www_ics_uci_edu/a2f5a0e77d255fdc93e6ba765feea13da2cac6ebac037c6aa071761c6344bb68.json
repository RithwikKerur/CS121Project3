Anderson, Richard N. Taylor and James E. Whitehead, Jr. in\n<i> Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Hypertext,</i>\nEdinburgh, September 1994. Association for Computing Machinery.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nEmerging software development environments are characterized by heterogeneity:\nthey are composed of diverse object stores, user interfaces, and tools. This\npaper presents an approach for providing hypertext services in this\nheterogeneous setting. Central notions of the approach include the following.\nAnchors are established with respect to interactive <i>views</i> of objects,\nrather than the objects themselves. Composable, <i>n</i>-ary links can be\nestablished between anchors on different views of objects stored\nin distinct object bases. Viewers (and objects) may be implemented in different\nprogramming languages afforded by a client-server architecture.\nMultiple, concurrently active viewers enable multimedia hypertext services.\nThe paper describes the approach and presents an architecture which supports\nit. Experience with the Chimera prototype and its relationship to other\nsystems is described.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:44:40 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
