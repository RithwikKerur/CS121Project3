When this function is the sum of constant node \nweights, the problem is trivially solved in linear time. When the objective \nis the sum of weights that are linear functions of a parameter, we show how \nto list all optima for all possible parameter values in O(n log n) time; \nthis parametric optimization problem can be used to solve many bicriterion \noptimizations problems, in which each node has two values xi and yi \nassociated with it, and the objective function is a bivariate function \nf(SUM(xi),SUM(yi)) of the sums of these two values. A special case, when f \nis the ratio of the two sums, is the Weighted Maximum-Mean Subtree Problem, \nor equivalently the Fractional Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree Problem on \nTrees; for this special case, we provide a linear time algorithm for this \nproblem when all weights are positive, improving a previous O(n log n) \nsolution, and prove that the problem is NP-complete when negative weights \nare allowed.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with D.
