This work proposes\nan innovative World Wide Web agent that uses a model of collaboration that\nleverages the natural incentives for individual users to easily provide for\ncollaborative work.  <p>\n<b>KEYWORDS: </b> computer-supported cooperative work, CSCW, social filtering,\ncollaboration, World Wide Web\n<h4>\n<a name=\"RTFToC2\">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>\nCollaborative efforts to discover Internet resources, such as interesting Web\npages, require work by users.  Unfortunately, users often will not do the\nextra, altruistic work, leading to adoption failures for social filtering\nsystems.<p>\nIn the work described below, individuals engage in resource discovery for\nthemselves.  Without extra work, other individuals can use that effort.<p>\nWe do this by using a naturally reoccurring problem with the Web.  After one\nhas discovered Web resources, a problem remains:  How do you know when to\n<i>re</i>visit those resources for new material?  Consider some common\npost-discovery situations:\n<ul>\n<li>\tYou know the page where a colleague has his publications.  You would like\nto obtain new papers as they are posted.  Furthermore, you would like to know\nabout interesting papers, rather than just any papers.\n<li>\tYou have obtained the page for the low cost clothes merchandiser.  You\nwould like to know when there is a sale on jeans or Hawaiian shirts.</ul>These\nare examples of change events that occur somewhat unpredictably and offer no\nexplicit notification.  Today, interested parties must occasionally check by\nhand.  This can be burdensome and tedious, and one may forget to do it on a\ntimely basis.  Furthermore, we would like an agent to discover\n<i>interesting</i> changes, rather than some insignificant change.  <p>\nIn order to track interesting changes, an agent needs to know what changes are\ninteresting and where to find them.  This paper is an overview of an agent that\ncollaborates with both users and their peers to identify potentially\ninteresting changes.  The agent works by soliciting user opinions about changes\nit finds to train a user model; an individual does this for her own good.  The\nagent can then share these opinions and findings with agents of like-minded\nusers, providing for collaborative effort.  This agent, Do-I-Care, and its\nmodel of collaboration are described below.\n<h4>\n<a name=\"RTFToC3\">LOCATING\nINTERESTING INFORMATION\n</a></h4>\nThere has been considerable effort devoted to the resource discovery problem on\nthe Web, mostly focusing on three types of technical methods. The first, active\nbrowser systems (e.g., Fish Search and WebWatcher), offer navigational\nsuggestions that direct the user along a path.  User models are obtained\ndirectly from users while they are browsing and require their active\nparticipation.<p>\nThe second, index creation and lookup systems (e.g., Harvest and Lycos), treat\nthe Web as a database of information to be cataloged and indexed.  Users must\nbe able to articulate their information goals and may need to periodically\nresubmit their searches to obtain new or future information.<p>\nThere are also several agents that monitor Web pages for <i>any</i>\nmodification, such as URL-minder.  However, many of the changes detected may be\nirrelevant. Also, the user must still discover the Web sites to be monitored.\n<h4>\n<a name=\"RTFToC4\">SOCIAL\nRESOURCE DISCOVERY\n</a></h4>\nAlthough technical discovery methods are valuable, they neglect perhaps the\nsingle most important method of discovery that people rely on -- other people.\nSocial resource discovery assumes the existence of others, who have located and\nevaluated relevant resources.  Opinions of like-minded individuals are also\nassumed to have more discriminatory value than an automated evaluation.  The\ngoal of social resource discovery systems is to aggregate and share the fruits\nof individual activity and knowledge.<p>\nRelatively few social resource discovery systems currently exist.  The Pointers\nsystem [3] facilitates the distribution of links to resources with accompanying\ncontext.  While the benefits to a pointer's recipient seem clear, the system\nrelies on a provider's desire to be helpful that may not always exist.  <p>\nOur work is closer in emphasis to Ringo [6] and GroupLens [5].  GroupLens uses\nnewsgroup article ratings to predict an article's relevance to a given user.\nBecause the weights assigned to other's opinions are proportionate to their\npast correlation with a user's opinions,  there is some benefit for users to\noffer opinions.  However, in both systems, the emphasis is on providing\ncollaborative effort, for unclear personal gain.<p>\nThe Do-I-Care agent attempts to avoid free-loading by exploiting the naturally\noccurring individual effort in a way that facilitates information sharing\nwithout incurring any significant additional costs.  It is similar in its\nincentives to Answer Garden [1].\n<h4>\n<a name=\"RTFToC5\">DO-I-CARE</a></h4>\nDo-I-Care was designed to help users discover <i>interesting</i> changes on the\nWeb, using both technical and social means. Do-I-Care agents automate periodic\nvisits to selected pages to detect interesting changes on behalf of\nindividuals.  They use machine learning to identify by example what changes are\ninteresting, and how often they occur.  It is in users' best interests to keep\ntheir personal agents informed about relevant pages and about the quality of\nreported changes.  In so doing, they can automatically contribute to the common\ngood, because Do-I-Care agents can also share information with other agents.<p>\nBecause of space limitations, we can only briefly discuss the system\narchitecture.  Each Do-I-Care agent must:\n<ul>\n<li>\tPeriodically visit a user-defined list of target pages.\n<li>\tIdentify any changes since the last time it visited.\n<li>\tDecide whether the changes were interesting\n<li>\tNotify the user if the change was interesting.\n<li>\tAccept relevance feedback on the interestingness of the change and\ntimeliness of the notification. \n<li>\tFacilitate information sharing and collaboration between individuals and\ngroups.</ul>We assume that Web pages generally change incrementally and that\nthe user has a list of Web pages that will have interesting information.  By\nlimiting the search to a small subset of Web pages specifically selected\n<i>because</i> they are likely to contain interesting information, we can\ngreatly improve precision.  By accepting or rejecting Do-I-Care's suggestions,\nthe user refines the types of changes that are interesting.<p>\nSince users provide relevance feedback, we can view the process of determining\nwhether a change is interesting as a classification task, and the process of\nlearning a user profile is a supervised learning task. We represent each change\nby a relatively small number of features.  We find words that are informative\nby computing the mutual information [4] between the presence of a word in the\nchange and the relevance feedback.  In addition, we use other change\nattributes, such as size and the number of links. A simple Bayesian classifier\n[2] then determines whether the change is interesting.<b></b><p>\n<b></b>Because different pages may be interesting for different reasons, users\nmay maintain multiple Do-I-Care agents specialized on particular topics or\nkinds of Web pages.  For example, the criteria for an interesting journal\nannouncement may be different from that for a news item.<p>\nOnce an agent spots an interesting change, the user is notified by e-mail, and\nthe change is appended to the agent's associated Web page.  This Web page is\nalso used for relevance feedback and collaborative activity.\n<h4>\n<a name=\"RTFToC6\">SHARING\nINTERESTING CHANGES\n</a></h4>\nSince all changes are reported through an agent's Web page, agents can use\ninformation from other agent's pages for their own change notifications.  The\ntechnical mechanism is simple.  Users who wish to allow their agent's Web page\nto be cascaded simply notify others of its existence. Cascaded agents' owners\ncontinue to use their agents as before, but now they are also sharing both\ntheir lists of interesting sites and their opinions about changes with others.\nAgents can be cascaded any number of times, allowing the creation of group or\norganizational \"new and interesting\" pages.<p>\nUsers of cascaded agents benefit by leveraging the work  and judgment of\ntrusted peers.  Gathering changes from cascaded agents increases recall, while\nexploiting other's filtering increases precision.  There is little social cost,\nsince no additional work is generated for anyone.  Thereby, the perceived costs\nand benefits favor collaboration.  \n<h4>\n<a name=\"RTFToC7\">SUMMARY</a></h4>\nDo-I-Care attempts to solve two post-discovery problems:  when should a user\nrevisit a known site for new information, and how does a user share new\ninformation with others who may be interested.  These post-discovery chores are\nlaborious, suffer from inequitable distribution of costs and benefits, and are\nnot both addressed by existing systems.  By providing a simple technical\nmechanism, we have found a collaboration mechanism that provides for group\neffort through individual incentives.\n<h4>\n<a name=\"RTFToC8\">REFERENCES</a></h4>\n1.\tAckerman, Mark S.
