Bush presents in \"As We May Think,\"\nstate two which are also found in the World Wide Web as described in the \narticle by T. Berners-Lee. et al.\n</H2>\n\nSome good answers would be:\n<UL>\n<LI>Multimedia.\n<LI>Records knowledge - boundless information world.\n<LI>Associatative indexing - concept of hypertext.\n<LI>Dissemination of knowledge.\n<LI>Scaling up - ability to access efficiently large quantities of data.\n<LI>Distributed, non-hierarchical.\n<LI>Computer-assisted collaboration.\n<LI>Easy to use interface, accessible to non-specialists.\n</UL>\n\n<H2>\nState two fundamental characteristics of the World Wide Web as \ndescribed by T. Berners-Lee et al. which are not present in V. Bush's\n\"As We May Think\".\n</H2>\n\nHow about:\n<UL>\n<LI>Consistent user interface.\n<LI>HTML.\n<LI>HTTP.\n<LI>Existence of a variety of browsers (specific browsers don't count,\n   as they are not fundamental).\n<LI>World-wideness, Internet-based, global network.\n</UL>\n\nNote that I used incomplete sentences in several of my answers.\nThis practice, however, was penalized on the quiz.\n\n<HR>\n\n<H1>\nWhat the heck are \"name space,\" \"address space,\" \"hierarchical\nspace\" and \"information space\"?\n</H1>\n\nThe shared meaning of space here is \"range of possibilities.\"  For instance,\nconsider \"7-digit phone number space.\"  This space does not include\n\"000-0000,\" as that is not a valid phone number.  \nBerners-Lee et al. write \"The prefix 'http' . . .\nindicates the address space,\" which means that the possibilities and syntax\nfollowing \"http\" may be different than what might follow another\nprefix.  Now make sure you completely understand the following very \nimportant sentence in the Berners-Lee article, \nfrom the top of the middle column on p. 78:\n\"The fact that it is easy to address an object anywhere on the Internet\nis essential . . . for the information space to be independent of\nthe network and server topology.\"  (Look up topology if you're not 100%\nclear on its meaning!)  Based on your experience so far, would you\nsay that this sentence is correct?\n<p>\nNo one got this question right.  My favorite valiant attempt was\n\"Space is used in an almost virtual way.\"  Be prepared for challenging \nvocabulary questions on future quizzes -- did someone say extensible? \nidempotent? metainformation? bit-map? wysiwyg? virtual?\n\n<HR>\n\n<H1>\nWhat did you do in lab?\n</H1>\n\n<H2>\nHow do you save a copy of an e-mail into a file in a subdirectory?\n</H2>\n\nThe magic word here is \"export\".\n\n<H2>\nHow do you interpret ^G or ^C?  \n</H2>\n\nFor full credit, you had to say \"hold down the control key and C or G.\"\nHalf credit for writing merely \"Control C\" or \"Control G\".\n\n<HR>\n\n<H1>\nFun with binary numbers.\n</H1>\n\n<H2>\nHow many bits do you need to represent 120 or 140 distinct values?\n</H2>\nEach (decimal) digit gives you 10 times as many distinct values.  Thus\nthere are 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 possible seven digit phone\nnumber, minus a few illegal ones such as 000-0000.  Each additional bit \n(binary digit) gives 2 times as many possibilities:\n<PRE>\nNumber   Distinct\nof bits  values     List of those distinct values\n-------  --------   -----------------------------------------------------\n  1         2       0, 1\n  2         4       00, 01, 10, 11\n  3         8       000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\n  4        16       0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0110, 0111, ... 1111\n  5        32       00000, 00001, 00010, 00011, ... 11100, 11101, 11110, 11111\n  6        64       000000, 000001, 000010, 000011, ... 111101, 111110, 111111\n  7       128       0000000, 0000001, 0000010, 0000011, ... 1111110, 1111111\n  8       256       00000000, 00000001, 00000010, ... 11111110, 11111111\n</PRE>\nSo, 120 values requires 7 bits (6 won't do), and 7 bits gives 128 distinct\nvalues.  140 values requires 8 bits (7 won't do), and 8 bits gives 256\ndistinct values.\n\n<HR>\n\n<H1>\nBaby, won't you drive my car?\n</H1>\n\nThere were two versions of this question.\nMost people correctly know what the units meant, but a lot\nof people messed up on the math.\n<p>\n2 micro-miles in 400 nano-hours is (2/1,000,000)/(400/1,000,000,000) mph,\nor 5 mph, which isn't even worth a kilo-nickel.\n<p>\nOn the other hand, 70 milli-miles in 100 micro-hours is\n(70/1,000)/(100/1,000,000) mph, or 700 mph, which is a pretty good deal.\n\n<HR>\n\n<H1>\nDescribe \"WWW client-waitperson architecture.\"\n</H1>\n\nHere are a couple of ways of handling the question,\nboth of which are much more detailed than I (SDF) would expect student\nanswers to be:\n<p>\n    An individual or organization wishing to provide information or\n    services via the Web do so via programs called \"servers\" which run\n    at all times.  When a person wants to access such information or\n    services, s/he does so by running a \"client\" program on her/his \"own\"\n    computer system.  This \"client\" program requests services from \n    various \"servers\" by contacting the server programs on whatever\n    system each server happens to be running.\n<p>\n    In general, a server provides a service to another program called a \n    \"client\" which (typically) is receiving commands from a person.\n    A client is a program which asks for service.  Generally it does so\n    because a human being tells it, \"Do this or do that\" but in order to do\n    this or do that the client program has to contact another program, called\n    a server, which delivers a service to the client program which in turn\n    uses what it gets from the server to meet the request/command issued by\n    the human being.\n<p>\nIn both cases, the key fact about a browser is that\n   a browser is a web client.  Based on direct/interactive control\n   by a person wanting to access information/services via the Web,\n   the browser contacts Web servers, makes requests in keeping with\n   the user's commands, and displays the results to the user in\n   an appropriate format.\n\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
