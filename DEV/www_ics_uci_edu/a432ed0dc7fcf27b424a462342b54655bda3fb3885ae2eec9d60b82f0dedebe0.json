Neither of\n  these formats show visually the space of documents, nor do they show\n  the conformation of the document space by categories in a way that\n  invites category exploration.  Likewise, conventional library search\n  tools (e.g. ANTPAC, INSPEC) do not present a graphic interface to allow\n  exploration of the collection, even when it has been indexed by human\n  librarians into subject categories.\n\n  Studies have shown that even when document collections are indexed by\n  keywords, users typically do not use them in their exploration of \n  the document collections.  We hypothesize that this is mainly due to\n  the lack of graphic support for such information foraging.\n\n  Our system seeks to present a visual and explorable diagram of the \n  many-to-many relationship between keywords and documents, as well as\n  a graphic display of that part of the category hierarchy relevent to\n  the document collection, as well as supporting interactive document\n  query and retrieval.   \n\n  Begun in Summer '99, this document space visualization project has\n  become an important research project for Dr. Wanda Pratt's group.  Our\n  project is wildly interdisciplinary, drawing on insights from software\n  engineering, theory of algorithms, cognitive science, and the fine arts.\n\nBENEFITS TO STUDENT TEAM MEMBERS\n\n  We expect we will learn a lot from one another!  In particular, you will\n  have the chance to use some of the current generation of client-server\n  tools for building web applications, as well as become skillful with\n  Java and its associated libraries, tools, and graphics packages.  We'll\n  probably also be learning some cognitive science to understand how\n  information presented graphically is understood by users.  In addition,\n  we will need to do some user-centered evaluation.  As an experienced\n  software engineer, I will be able to teach you some of the theory and\n  practice of object-oriented design and analysis, in particular, how to\n  differentiate between a \"good\" and \"bad\" design.\n\nPROJECT OUTLINE\n    \n  Mr. Goggin and Ms. Lan are currently putting together a prototype\n  graphic depiction of the many-to-many relation between documents\n  and keywords using multidimensional scaling (MDS).  We expect to\n  demonstrate this prototype at the Jan. 28th ICS Research Symposium in\n  addition to the present tree-based category graphic.\n\n  There are essentially two parts of the project in which our ICS125\n  team members will be involved:\n\n  1. Finishing the graphical tools for displaying a document\n  space visualization\n\n    The present reused code for displaying the tree-based category graphic\n    has very low capability because of a bug.  We need to either debug the\n    code (by ourselves or in collaboration with the original developer) or\n    redesign/reimplement it.\n   \n    Add zooming-in capability to the tree-based and MDS graphics.\n\n    Do preliminary user testing and evaluation\n\n  2. Extending the tool to allow graphical browsing and\n  searching\n  \n    Designing efficient data structures and algorithms to support rapid\n    updating of displayed graphics\n\n    Designing and exploring alternative graphical representations\n\n    Interfacing with other research projects (other graduate students' and\n    Dr. Pratt's) to allow true real-time online searching through a web\n    front end.\n\n    User testing and evaluation of the system\n \n  We expect to have our first team meetings soon.  But it is not\n  likely that there will be much work to be done before Jan. 28th.\n\n</pre>\n<hr>\n\n<p><a HREF=\"projects.html\">ICS125 WQ00 Project Opportunities<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"../ics125.html\">ICS125 WQ00<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
