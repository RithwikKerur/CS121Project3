In fact, you can be wrong up to a factor of 5x, so you should\r\ngive us only the order of the value, i.e. 10^{300,000}, and not the exact value like \r\n2.1425*10^{300,000}, etc.\r\n\r\nIn C-4.11, assume that addition and multiplication are primitive operations, but\r\ndont assume that there's a primitive operation that computes an exponentiation.\r\n(Such assumption would be unjustified by any hardware or software we know of.)\r\n\r\nNote that R-4.28 is implied by the claim I stated in the lecture, namely that every \r\npolynomial of degree d is O(n^d).  However, you cannot \"solve\" this one by just stating \r\nthat it's implied by this claim.  Either show that this claim is true in general or show \r\nthat this particular case of it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Scoring*:\r\n\r\nR-12 and 21 are 15 points\r\nR-27, 28, and C-11 are 10 points\r\nAll the others are 5 points", "encoding": "ascii"}
