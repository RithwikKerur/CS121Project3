Sure, it had the usual\nsuspects (e.g. Towers of Hanoi), but it also had one puzzle which I'd never\nseen before.  I bought the book (for a buck) and read it through.  As it\nturns out, it's an awful book, but this one puzzle intrigues me.\n\nThe book is awful because the puzzles are poorly described (as if someone had\ntaken a month worth of the net and published it without editorial change)\nand the answers aren't always the clearest or most elegant solutions.\n\nI would cite the book, but I don't have it here.  Nonetheless, here's the puzzle\n(hopefully described more clearly than in the book):\n\nSuppose you have a line segment (it can be of unit length, if you want - that\ndoesn't really matter).  Now you are going to play a little game:\n\n1. Place a point (anywhere) on the segment and mark it #1\n2. Divide the segment into two even pieces (at 1/2).  Now, unless you've chosen\n   0.5 for your first point, that point is in one of the two sides of the\n   segment.  Put another point (let's call it #2) anywhere in the other side.\n3. Now, divide the original segment into three equal pieces.   If you're lucky, \n   #1 and #2 are in different sub-segments.  Add a third point (#3) anywhere in \n   the third segment.\n4. Now, divide the segment into 4 equal sub-segments...\n\nOnce a point has been placed, you can't move it.\nRepeat this exercise until two points end up in the same sub-segment.  That's\nwhen you lose.  What is the maximum number of points you can put on the line?\n\nExample:\n\n|--1--------------------|\n\n|--1--------.---------2-|\n\n|--1----.--3----.-----2-|\n\n|--1--.----3.----4.---2-|\n\n|--1-.---5.3---.-4--.-2-|  (OK, it's hard to divide 24/5 in ASCII)\n\n|--1.---.5-3.---.4---.2-|\n\nNow we're stuck because #5 and #3 are in the same sub-segment and there are\ntwo empty sub-segments where #6 needs to go.\n\nThe book claims that 17 (I think) is THOUGHT to be the highest attainable \nnumber of points.  This seems to be imminently discernable using standard\nsearch techniques (and a fast machine).  Am I right?\n\nWhat's the poop?  Any pointers.\n -- MM\n\nMatthew Merzbacher\tARPA:\t<A HREF=\"mailto:matthew@CS.UCLA.EDU\">matthew@CS.UCLA.EDU</A>\nMoo - Moo Moo  \t\tUUCP:\t...!{uunet|rutgers|ucbvax}!cs.ucla.edu!matthew\n               \t\tBONENET:\t<A HREF=\"mailto:...!tibia%pelvis!matthew@jawbone\">...!tibia%pelvis!matthew@jawbone</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
