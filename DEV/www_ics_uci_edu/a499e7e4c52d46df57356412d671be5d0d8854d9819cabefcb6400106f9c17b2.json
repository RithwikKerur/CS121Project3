An undergraduate class in\nalgorithms is also good background. The course, however, is fairly self-contained\nand should be accessible to\nany student who is comfortable with mathematical abstraction and proofs.\n\n<h3> Course Requirements </h3>\nProblem sets will be given every   week, handed out Friday and due the following Friday.\nThere will be a take-home final exam.\n<p>\n<b> Homework Policies: </b>\nThe homework exercised are an essential part of this course\nbecause the practice solving problems is important part of\nunderstanding the material. You can probably find many of the\nsolutions to the homework exercises on the internet or in the\nliterature but you will not get the benefit of solving the problems\non your own. Therefore, the only sources you are allowed to consult\nin solving  these problems are the text and notes from class\n(your own or those of a classmate).\n<p>\nI encourage you to work in small groups, but you must note your\ncollaborators on the homework you turn in. In addition, you must\nwrite up your own solutions without any collaboration.\n<p>\nYou are also encouraged to put your solutions into LaTeX.\nHere is a template that you can use:\n<a href=\"hw_template.tex\">\nHomework Template\n</a>.\n<h3>  Reading list </h3>\nIt is recommended that you have access to:\n<UL>\n<li><it> Computational Complexity </it>, by Christos Papadimitriou, Addison Wesley, 1993, ISBN: 978-0201530827</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<h3> Lecture Topics and Homework </h3>\n\n<table border>\n<tr>\n\n<th>\nWeek\n</th>\n<th>\nTopic\n</th>\n<th>\nHomework\n</th>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 1\n</td>\n<td>\nModels of Computation, Time and Space Complexity\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n<a href=\"hw1.pdf\"> Homework 1 </a> <br>\n<a href=\"hw1.tex\"> LaTeX Source </a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek2\n</td>\n<td>\nNon-determinism\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n<a href=\"hw2.pdf\"> Homework 2 </a> <br>\n<a href=\"hw2.tex\"> LaTeX Source </a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 3\n</td>\n<td>\nCLASS CANCELLED.\n</td>\n<td align=center>\nNo Homework\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 4\n</td>\n<td>\nCircuits, Uniformity and advice, the NC hierarchy\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n<a href=\"hw3.pdf\"> Homework 3 </a> <br>\n<a href=\"hw3.tex\"> LaTeX Source </a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 5\n</td>\n<td>\nRandomness: ranomized complexity classes, error reduction, pseudo-randomnumber generators.\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n<a href=\"hw4.pdf\"> Homework 4 </a> <br>\n<a href=\"hw4.tex\"> LaTeX Source </a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 6\n</td>\n<td>\nRandomness: error-correcting codes, transforming worst-case hardness into average-case hardness.\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n-\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 7\n</td>\n<td>\nAlternation and the Polynomial Hierarchy\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n<a href=\"hw5.pdf\"> Homework 5 </a> <br>\n<a href=\"hw5.tex\"> LaTeX Source </a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 8\n</td>\n<td>\nInteractive Complexity Classes\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n-\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 9\n</td>\n<td>\nProbabilistically Checkable Proofs and Hardness of Approximation\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n<a href=\"hw6.pdf\"> Homework 6 </a> <br>\n<a href=\"hw6.tex\"> LaTeX Source </a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\nWeek 10\n</td>\n<td>\nCounting Complexity Classes, Relativization and Natural Proofs\n</td>\n<td align=center>\n<a href=\"hw7.pdf\"> Homework 7 </a> <br>\n<a href=\"hw7.tex\"> LaTeX Source </a>\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n\n\n</table>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
