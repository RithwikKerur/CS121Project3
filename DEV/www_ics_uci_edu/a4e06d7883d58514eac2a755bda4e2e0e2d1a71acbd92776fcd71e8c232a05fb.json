I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; criticise\nKenji's suggestion that this is the only way that should be\navailable.  I think that HTTP headers are quite appropriate, as\nlong as there's also a way to create a link to a version.\n\n&gt; - The slash is already reserved for hierarchies. Hierarchies of different\n&gt; origin can be piled by juxtaposing the path name. This can't be said for\n&gt; the other proposed schemas:\n&gt;       <a href=\"ftp://host/dir/file;A;version=x\">ftp://host/dir/file;A;version=x</a>\n&gt; or\n&gt;       <a href=\"wais://host/database/c/A;B;version=x\">wais://host/database/c/A;B;version=x</a>\n&gt; while being outside of the scope of a discussion on HTTP, look pretty silly\n&gt; anyway and would make the ftp or wais access to these resources impossible\n&gt; or completely different.\n\nUmm... how would the ftp server (which was written by a\ncompletely different people and doesn't know a URL from a hole in\nthe ground) deal with <a href=\"ftp://host/dir/projectX/1.5/Mac/French/file.c\">ftp://host/dir/projectX/1.5/Mac/French/file.c</a>\ngiven that, more than likely, \"projectX\" is the name of a\nconfiguration file, 1.5 specifies a revision in a VCS file, and\n\"Mac\" and \"French\" are, respectively, a compile-time option and a\nrun-time locale specification?\n\nI think that this particular argument is specious.\n\n&gt; Finally, I find slashes easier to read than adding yet another decoration.\n&gt; Suppose I want to access  anchor \"chapter1\" of the document described by\n&gt; author=\"bill\" and name=\"foo\" as retrieved by version Y of the search engine\n&gt; \"application\". For instance, what would be the right syntax in this case?\n&gt;\n&gt;       <a href=\"http://host/cgi-bin/application;version=Y?author=bill+name=foo#chapter1\">http://host/cgi-bin/application;version=Y?author=bill+name=foo#chapter1</a>\n&gt;       <a href=\"http://host/cgi-bin/application?author=bill+name=foo;version=Y#chapter1\">http://host/cgi-bin/application?author=bill+name=foo;version=Y#chapter1</a>\n&gt;       <a href=\"http://host/cgi-bin/application?author=bill+name=foo#chapter1;version=1\">http://host/cgi-bin/application?author=bill+name=foo#chapter1;version=1</a>\n&gt;\n&gt; Compare to the simple:\n&gt;       <a href=\"http://host/cgi-bin/application/Y?author=bill+name=foo#chapter1\">http://host/cgi-bin/application/Y?author=bill+name=foo#chapter1</a>\n\nSince the HTTP URL syntax states that URL parameters preceed\nqueries, the correct syntax would be\n\n        <a href=\"http://host/cgi-bin/application;version=Y?author=bill+name=foo#chapter1\">http://host/cgi-bin/application;version=Y?author=bill+name=foo#chapter1</a>\n\nThat is, your first option.\n\n&gt; - I don't know if there exists a file system in which a file and a\n&gt; directory can have exactly the same name, and are distinguished by the fact\n&gt; that one is a directory and the other is a file. I mean, if it were\n&gt; possible for a directory to have both a file and a directory called\n&gt; file.html, then the URL:\n&gt;       <a href=\"http://host/dir/file.html/1.5\">http://host/dir/file.html/1.5</a>\n&gt; would be ambiguous. If there is such a perverted file system, I will\n&gt; withdraw my points and leave to become a goatherd in Sardinia (Italy).\n\nWell the Thoth operating system from the university of waterloo\nallowed a node in the filesystem to contain both data and links\nto subnodes.  So a \"directory\" could be opened and read as a\nfile, or it could be traversed to find subdirs.  I understand\nthat the weather in Italy is very nice ;-)\n\n- David\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0060.html\">Fabio Vitali: \"Re: Version identifier in URL\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0058.html\">David J.
