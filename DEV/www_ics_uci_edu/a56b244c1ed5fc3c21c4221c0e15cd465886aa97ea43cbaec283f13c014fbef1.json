It will be shown that the vertices  \nof G can be partitioned into three sets A,B,C such that no edge joins\na vertex in A with a vertex in B, neither A nor B  contains more than  \n2n/3 vertices, and C contains no more that 2v(2n) vertices.  An  algorithm will be\npresented which finds such a partition in O(n) time.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
