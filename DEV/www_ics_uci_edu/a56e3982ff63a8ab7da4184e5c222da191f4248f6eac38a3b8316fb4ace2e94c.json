Berners-Lee, one of the things W3 stands \nfor is the concept that one can retrieve an array of \ninformation which have references by which they could be \nretrieved.\n<P>The World Wide Web also has an address system (URI) \nwhich is incorporated so that one has a listing of the \nreferences, although many different protocols exist.\n<P>There is also a network protocol (HTTP) which gives the \nperformance and features which are not otherwise \navailable.  For a detailed definition of what HTTP is, \n<i>click</i> <A \nHREF=\"http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/\n?Hypertext+Transfer+Protocol\"><b>Hypertext Transfer \nProtocol</b></A>.  \n<P>The WEB also uses a markup language (HTML), which serves \nthe purpose of transmitting basic things across the \nnet.  For a more detailed definition of what HTML is, \n<i>click</i> <A \nHREF=\"http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/\n?Hypertext+Markup+Language\">\n<b>Hypertext Markup Language</b></A>.\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What are the two main \ntypes of Internet connections and what are \nthe differences between the two?</H2> The two main \ntypes of Internet connections are <A \nHREF=\"http://wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/?direct+connection\"><b>direct</b></A>and indirect connections.  Both types use either modems or existing newtwork cards, and have a wide range of prices.\nThe main difference between the two is that with a \ndirect connection, the computer acts as an individual \nnode on the Internet.\n<P>With a direct connection, the computer has its own \n<A HREF=\"http//wombat.doc.ic.ac.uk/?IP+address\"><b>IP \naddress</b></A>, and it can be established as a \nserver for FTP, Gopher, News, or the W3. By doing \nthis, you can use the software available to bring in \nmail to your own computer.  For programs such as \nMosaic, one must use direct connections.\n<P>Indirect connection, however, gives a disk space \nand access time on another computer.  The mail \nreceived and transfer files stays on that server.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>What does the UCI College \nof Medicine have to offer?</H2></A> The UCI College \nof Medicine has alot to offer to its students.
