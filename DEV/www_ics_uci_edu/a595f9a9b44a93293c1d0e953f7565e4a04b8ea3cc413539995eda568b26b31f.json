(<A \nHREF=\"http://hyperreal.com/drugs/marijuana/misc/nectar.of.delight\">The Nectar of Delight</A> mentions that there is\nevidence of hemp fiber being used in China at around 4000 B.C., as well as hemp rope in Turkestan at 3000 B.C.).   \n Cannabis, being the most commonly used of the hemp plants, produces the most durable cloth, or 'canvass'.  Canvass was used \nextensively for sails on early sea vessels, being the only material that would not rot when it came \ninto contact with the salty spray.  Today, this cloth is used to produce clothing slightly softer than cotton \nbut far more durable and longer lasting.  Cannabis is the only hemp plant that produces three \nadditonally important products:  Pulp, seed, and medicine.  The pulp is used for fuel and paper products:  As \n a source of cellulosic biomass, it used for the production of biomass\nfuels (almost free of metals and sulfur, causing significantly less pollution than fossil fuels).  By gluing \nhemp stalks together under pressure, a tough 'composite board' (with more elasticity and strength than \nhardwood) is produced.     The \nseed is a nutritious food product for all animals of the food chain, being rich in protein and fatty oils. (The \noil from the seeds can be used as a foundation for paints/varnishes).  Medically, Cannabis is ranked amongst the \ntop medicines as a 'panaceas' or 'cure-all'; it is used to treat everything from common headaches and asthma to \nmultiple sclerosis and cancer.\n<p> Today, certain parts of the hemp plant are legal to possess.  According to \n<A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.vslib.cz/00/pub/news.answers/drugs/hemp-marijuana\">Frequently Asked Questions about \nCannabis-Hemp</A>, they are the roots, stalks, stems, and sterilized \nseeds--the components used to manufacture \nmost hemp products.  The marijuana parts of the plant (which includes the flowers, buds, leaves, and living \nseeds) are illegal to possess.  Currently, hemp production in this country is treated as a felony because all \ncrops are considered to contain a high level of tetrahydrocannabinols (THC--the mind-altering chemical in \nmarijuana).  The fact is, industrial hemp can be grown inexpensively and, according to <A \nHREF=\"gopher://sunsite.sut.ac.jp/0R51-24473-/academic-info/agriculture/sustainable_agriculture/permacultur\ne/Boulder-Hemp-Initiative-Project\">The \nBoulder Hemp Initiative Project</A>, \n</A>, with no \"pschoactive properties\".  So why is the crop, to this day, illegal?  The reasons date \nback to the Spanish American War.\n<p> Until the late 1800's, practically all of our clothing and paper was made from Hemp.  After the Spanish \nAmerican War, many of the Mexican soldiers that fought against our country began to settle \nin the South-Eastern U.S., taking cheap labor jobs.  (During the War, Mexicans had received a reputation under \nthe leadership of Poncho Villa to be rowdy marijuana-smokers.)  When the depression hit, jobs became scarce, and \nWhite America immorally  blamed Mexicans for being violent pot addicts.  As a result of this panic, marijuana \nwas outlawed in several states.  When prohibition ended in the early 30's, unemployed police officers found \nwork in enforcing new drug laws--by convincing American families of the dangers of marijuana.  This propoganda, \ncombined with the hemp opposition from newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst (fearing that hemp paper \ncompetiton would threaten a large cheap-paper deal of his) led our Federal legislature to pass the Marijuana Tax \nAct of 1937.  This law not only destroyed the national hemp industry, but also led to its illegality shorty after World War II.  \n\t<p>On an proper social level, it can't be said that hemp has made it popular.  Anti-hemp propoganda has \nbeen expressed in such films as \"Reefer Madness\" and its sequel.  During the 1970's, in fact, every mention of \nthe word \"hemp\" was found and removed from American high school textbooks!  \n <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to Table of Contents.</it></a>\n<HR>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>Proponents and Their Products</H2></A>\n<p>As mentioned by Ben Masel in his <A HREF=\"http://hyperreal.com/drugs/marijuana/hemp/hemp.flyer\">Untitled Hemp \nFlyer</A>, \"America cannot return to prosperity without restoring prosperity to its farmers\".  In his hemp-\ninformative essay, Masel points out that the potential for perhaps the greatest time, space, money, and energy \nconserving crop in this country remains as a red-taped taboo and an imported commodity (mostly from \nEurope and China, where low THC strains are allowed to harvest).  Oh well!  In the meantime, while we are still legally \nallowed to wear clothes made from hemp fiber, there will always be a variety of hemp products available to the \nAmerican consumer.<p>On line, and located in San Francisco, California, is the <A \nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us/00/Art/grateful_dead/hemporium\">Hemporium</A>, offering a variety of \"hemp \nproducts in a boutique setting\".  The specialties that this shop offers includes custom-fitted fabrics, made \nfrom 100% hemp:  How about a tailor-made blazer for $150.00, or a replica of The Declaration of Independence on hemp\npaper for only $23.00? They also sell 100% Hemp seed oil, a favorite amongst vegetarians and health-enthusists, \nfor only $23.00 per 8-ounce bottle.  Offering a general catalog of hemp products is  <A \nHREF=\"http://www.hempbc.com/virtual_store/catalog/catalogmain.html\">HempBC's </A>Online Catalogue, \nlocated in Vancouver, BC.  Give them your credit card on-line, and they will sell you anything from hemp \ncosmetics, underwear, and ties to such raw textiles as paper and fabric.<P> But the proponents of cannabis \nnot only include its business-people, but also important activists and politicians.  Perhaps the most famous hemp activist \nis Jack Herer, author of the pro-hemp bible, \"The Emperor Wears No Clothes\".  The book is a series of essays and chapters \non hemp uses, current legislation, and proposed legalization.\n<A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.vslib.cz/00/pub/news.answers/drugs/hemp-marijuana\">Frequently Asked Questions about Cannabis \nHemp</A> refers to Herer as \"the world's most beloved hemp activist\".  (I, myself had the rare pleasure of speaking \nwith the man at a small hemp rally in Costa Mesa this past summer--and boy, does this guy have a lot to say!)  \nEqually powerful as a hemp-enthusiast is California Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, who is sponsoring \"medical \nmarijuana bill, AB 1597\", a movement that would protect doctor-recommended patients (usually terminally ill) \nagainst the laws of personal possession and marijuana cultivation.  More on this fascinating topic, including \nmention of The Cannabis Buyer's Club (a store in San Francisco that the police have thus far ignored for selling \nmarijuana to dying people) can be located at <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shaman/files/NORML-news/NORML-news-3-2-95.html\">NORML: News for 3-2-95</A>.<p>  In \nthe lawmaker's court these days, marijuana seems to be an entirely new ballgame:  On February 9 of this year, the \nBaltimore Sun's front page stated that a Baltimore Grand Jury suggested the decriminalization of marijuana in an \nattempt to remove profit from the illegal drug trade, and as an \"honest response\" against the fact that possession \nlaws are seldom enforced<A \nHREF=\"http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shaman/files/NORML-news/NORML-news-2-9-95.html\">(NORML: News for 2-9-95)</A>.             \nNote that these recent developments are advancing the status of \nmarijuana instead of hemp; however, with the legalization of \nmarijuana comes the legalization of growing hemp once again.\n<p></A>Highly influential on the future of hemp products is the poweful, non-profit CHA \n(Coalition for Hemp Awareness).  In April 1993, the CHA, along with \nthe four other largest hemp companies in America, formed the True \nHemp Industry Alliance.  According to <A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us/00/Environment/hemp.labels\">HempWorld</A>, this \norganization will  provide for a \"Seal\" of authenticity that \"shall\naccompany all True Hemp Fabric and True Hemp Products imported,\ndistributed, or manufactured by those who join this cooperative\neffort\".  The reason behind these painstaking measures is \nthat fraudulent companies have been offering hemp products to the public that \nare, in fact, hemp-less and counterfeit.                                                            \n\n\n\n <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to Table of Contents.</it></a>\n<HR>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>Hemp Inventions and Viewpoints of My Own</H2></A>\n<p>When the conversation spins around to the issue of hemp, I myself have a heck of a lot to\nsay:  But I will try to keep my observations brief, and written with the optomism that hemp shall soon be legalized.\n <p> There is an infinite number of uses for hemp in today's \nworld, many of which are yet to be utilized.  For example, we could use hemp to make cement, to pave our roads and build \nour foundations:  Currently in France, a process that mineralizes hemp stalks into a heavy-duty,\n synthetic chemical-free cement (called \"Isochanvre\") is being used for drywall and insulation.\nAlthough hemp-manufactured bioplastics have not been fully developed, I believe them to be the wave of the future:\nPlastic products that we currently waste our precious time and resources unnaturally developing could be\n beneficially replaced by a synthetic plastic made from natural means.  Not only will we be able to produce a entirely\nbiodegradable, recyclable material, but we will also boost the economy of our nation's producers.  In an untitled\n WWW document \nfrom <A HREF=\"http://hyperreal.com/drugs/marijuana/hemp/not.for.environment\">Mike Berger</A>, this anti-hemp activist states\nthat, \"Unfortunately, the commercial/environmental issue is very weak\".  What this person obviously does not understand, is that \nhemp could be the one crop to preserve the future of our farmers.  Last year,<A \nHREF=\"gopher://sunsite.sut.ac.jp/0R51-24473-/academic-info/agriculture/sustainable_agriculture/permaculture/Boulder-Hemp-Initiative-Project> \nThe Boulder Hemp Initiative Project</A> published \na consumer report that contained the following information:  The total \"Estimated Value of a Hemp Crop\", utilizing all parts \nof the plant for everthing except substance intake, is valued at $860.00 per acre; the \"Value of Comparable Crops\" is (per \nacre) $370.00 for cotton, $50 for douglas fir, and $170.00 for soybeans.  As a space efficient, pesticide-free crop, hemp \ncould replace all three of these standards as a healthier and sturdier substitute.  And our farmers--couldn't they use the extra \ncash to enhance their farms with state-of-the-art resources?\n<p>\tPerhaps the most useful product that hemp could be attributed to is our every day paper needs.  There is no need to cut down as \nmuch as one more tree when we can grow fields of hemp.  While a tree can take decades to spawn to maturity, a hemp plant takes \nless than \nnine months to grow to full bloom.  Every new book, newspaper, and milk carton could be constructed from this easily grown resource.\n\n<HR>          \n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>Index of Sources</H2></A>\n<p>1.
