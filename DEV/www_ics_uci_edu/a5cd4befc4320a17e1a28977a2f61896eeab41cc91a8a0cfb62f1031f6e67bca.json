The course covers a\ncombination of different core areas in computer science including\noperating systems, computer architecture, networking, and\ncompilers. It is recommended to take this during your sophomore year\nso that it can serve as a preview for more in-depth upper-division\ncourses.\n    </li>\n\n\n    <li>\n    <strong>ICS 31 Introduction to Programming:</strong> This course is\nan introduction to fundamental concepts and techniques for writing\nsoftware. The Python language is taught as used to introduce basic\nprogramming concepts. Topics covered include the syntax and semantics\nof data types, expressions, exceptions, control structures,\ninput/output, methods, classes, and pragmatics of programming. I teach\nthis class during summer session.\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n    <strong>ECPS 207 Security and Privacy Issues in CPS:</strong> As\nspecialized computing devices and components rapidly proliferate into\nmany aspects of everyday life, including: automotive, avionics,\nhousehold automation, and medicine. This course covers modern security\nand privacy issues in Embedded Systems (ES) and Cyber-Physical Systems\n(CPS). The main goal is for students to attain familiarity with the\nrange of threats and countermeasures facing ES/CPS. Material includes\nnecessary cryptography background for students without prior exposure\nto that topic, as well as a primer on security protocols. The core of\nthe course will focus on recent developments in security and privacy\nin ES/CPS. As this is a fast-moving field with constant research\nadvances, the exact list of topics is expected to change every few\nyears. This is a graduate-level course.\n\n    </li>\n\n    <li>\n    <strong>CS 297P Capstone Design Project:</strong> This course\nrequires student groups to design and develop a large-scale system as\na quarter-long project. The system can be built from both software and\nhardware components. The specific project is determined by each group\nin collaboration with the instructor. Each group must implement at\nleast a working prototype and test this using relevant use cases\nand/or input data. This is a graduate-level course.\n    </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n  <h3> Courses, On-line </h3>\n\nI teach two online course specializations through UCI Division of Continuing\nEducation and the Coursera online educational platform.\n\n  <ul class=\"genlist\">\n\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/iot?\" <strong> An Introduction to Programming the Internet of Things (IOT) Specialization:</strong></a>\nThis specialization covers embedded systems, the Raspberry Pi\nPlatform, and the Arduino environment for building devices that can\ncontrol the physical world. In the final Capstone Project, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll\napply the skills you learned by designing, building, and testing a\nmicrocontroller-based embedded system, producing a unique final\nproject suitable for showcasing to future employers.\n    </li>\n\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang\" <strong> Programming with Google Go Specialization:</strong></a>\n\nThis specialization introduces the Go programming language from Google\nand provides learners with an overview of Go's special features. Upon\ncompleting the three-course sequence, learners will have gained the\nknowledge and skills needed to create concise, efficient, and clean\napplications using Go.\n\n    </li>\n\n  </ul>\n\n  <br />\n  \n  \n</div> <!-- close main div -->\n\n</div> <!--  close bgwrapper -->\n\n<hr class=\"bottombar\" />\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
