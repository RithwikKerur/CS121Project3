What is Bob's key?\n\n<li>\n  Suppose Eve has learned that Bob is using a Vigenere cipher\n  with keyword length <i>m</i> < 12, and she has been able to apply\n  a chosen-plaintext attack to learn that the plaintext\n  ``AAAAAAAA'' has ``BCDEBCDE'' as its\n  ciphertext.  What are the possible values for <i>m</i>?\n\n</ol>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
