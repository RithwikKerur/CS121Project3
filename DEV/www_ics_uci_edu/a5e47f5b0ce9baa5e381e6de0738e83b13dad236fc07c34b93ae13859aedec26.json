When the buffer\nis full, one item is removed to the output sequence, making room for the\nnext input item. This step is repeated until the input sequence is\nexhausted and the buffer is empty. The objective is to find a sequence of\nremovals that minimizes the total number of color changes in the output\nsequence. The problem formalizes numerous applications in computer and\nproduction systems, and is known to be NP-hard.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe give the first constant factor approximation guarantee for RBM. Our\nalgorithm is based on an intricate &ldquo;rounding&rdquo; of the\nsolution to an LP\nrelaxation for RBM, so it also establishes a constant upper bound on the\nintegrality gap of this relaxation. Our results improve upon the best\nprevious bound of $O(\\sqrt{\\log k})$ of Adamaszek et al. (STOC 2011) that\nused different methods and gave an online algorithm. Our constant factor\napproximation beats the super-constant lower bounds on the competitive\nratio given by Adamaszek et al. This is the first demonstration of an\noffline algorithm for RBM that is provably better than any online\nalgorithm.\n</p>\n\n(From <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4504\">a paper</a> by Noa\nAvigdor-Elgrabli and Yuval Rabani at SODA 2013.)\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
