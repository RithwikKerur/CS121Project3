Extended Black-and-White fax mode</h2>\n      <p>\n            This section defines the extended black-and-white mode or Profile F\n            of TIFF for facsimile. It provides a standard definition of what has\n            historically been known as TIFF Class F and now TIFF-F. In doing so,\n            it aligns this mode with current ITU-T Recommendations for black-\n            and-white fax and with existing industry practice. Implementations of\n            this profile include implementations of Profile S.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            This section describes extensions to the minimal interchange set of\n            fields (Profile S) that provide a richer set of black-and-white\n            capabilities. The fields and values described in this section are a\n            superset of the fields and values defined for the minimal interchange\n            set in Section 3. In addition to the MH encoding, Modified READ (MR)\n            and Modified Modified READ (MMR) encoding as described in [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>] and\n            [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.6, Facsimile coding schemes and coding control functions for group 4 facsimile apparatus, November 1988\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.6\">T.6</a>] are supported.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            Section 4.1 gives an overview of TIFF-F. Section 4.2 describes the\n            TIFF fields that SHALL be used in this mode. Section 4.3 describes\n            the fields that MAY be used in this mode. In the spirit of the\n            original TIFF-F specification, Sections 4.4 and 4.5 discuss technical\n            implementation issues and warnings. Section 4.6 gives an example use\n            of TIFF-F. Section 4.7 gives a summary of the required and\n            recommended fields and their values.\n         \n      </p><a name=\"sub1\"></a><h3>4.1. TIFF-F Overview</h3>\n      \n      \n      <p>\n            Though it has been in common usage for many years, TIFF-F has\n            previously never been documented in the form of a standard.  An\n            informal TIFF-F document was originally created by a small group of\n            fax experts led by Joe Campbell.  The existence of TIFF-F is noted in\n            [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>] but it is not defined.  This document serves as the formal\n            definition of the F application of [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>] for Internet applications.\n            For ease of reference, the term TIFF-F will be used throughout this\n            document as a shorthand for the extended black-and-white mode or\n            profile of TIFF for facsimile.\n         \n      </p>\n      <p>\n            Up until the TIFF 6.0 specification, TIFF supported various \"Classes\"\n            which defined the use of TIFF for various applications. Classes were\n            used to support specific applications. In this spirit, TIFF-F has\n            been known historically as \"TIFF Class F\".  Previous informal TIFF-F\n            documents [<a title=\"TIFF Class F specification, Apr 28, 1990, ftp://ftp.faximum.com/pub/documents/tiff_f.txt\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF-F0\">TIFF-F0</a>] used the \"Class F\" terminology.  As of TIFF 6.0\n            [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>], the TIFF Class concept has been eliminated in favor of the\n            concept of Baseline TIFF.  Therefore, this document updates the\n            definition of TIFF-F as the F profile of TIFF for facsimile, by using\n            Baseline  TIFF as defined in [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>] as the starting point and then\n            adding the TIFF extensions to Baseline TIFF which apply for TIFF-F.\n            In almost all  cases, the resulting definition of TIFF-F fields and\n            values remains  consistent with those used historically in earlier\n            definitions of TIFF  Class F.  Where some of the values for fields\n            have been updated to provide more precise conformance with the ITU-T\n            [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>] and [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.30 - Procedures for Document Facsimile Transmission in the General Switched Telephone Network, June 1996\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.30\">T.30</a>] fax recommendations, these differences are noted.\n         \n      </p>\n      <a name=\"sub2\"></a><h3>4.2.

New fields</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   Three new, optional fields, used in the original TIFF-F description\n   to describe page quality, are defined in this specification.  The\n   information contained in these fields is usually obtained from\n   receiving facsimile hardware (if applicable). They SHOULD NOT be used\n   in writing TIFF-F files for facsimile image data that is error\n   corrected or otherwise guaranteed not to have coding errors. Some\n   applications need to understand exactly the error content of the\n   data.  For example, a CAD program might wish to verify that a  file\n   has a low error level before importing it into a high-accuracy\n   document. Because Group 3 facsimile devices do not necessarily\n   perform error correction on the image data, the quality of a received\n   page must be inferred from the pixel count of decoded scan lines. A\n   \"good\" scan line is defined as a line that, when decoded, contains\n   the correct number of pixels. Conversely, a \"bad\" scan line is\n   defined as a line that, when decoded, comprises an incorrect number\n   of pixels.\n\nBadFaxLines(326)                                           SHORT or LONG\n    The number of \"bad\" scan lines encountered by the facsimile device\n    during reception.

That\n   is, when the BadFaxLines and ImageLength fields indicate that the\n   facsimile device encountered lines with an incorrect number of pixels\n   during reception, the CleanFaxData field indicates whether these bad\n   lines are actually still in the data or if the receiving facsimile\n   device replaced them with regenerated lines.\n\nConsecutiveBadFaxLines(328)                               LONG or SHORT\n    Maximum number of consecutive \"bad\" scanlines received.

By using\n   strips, a TIFF reader need not load the entire image into memory,\n   thus enabling it to fetch and decompress small random portions of the\n   image as necessary.\n\n   The number of scanlines in a strip is described by the RowsPerStrip\n   value and the number of bytes in the strip after compression by the\n   StripByteCount value.  The location in the TIFF file of each strip is\n   given by the StripOffsets values.\n\n   Strip size is application dependent. The recommended approach for\n   multi- page TIFF-F images is to represent each page as a single\n   strip. Existing TIFF-F usage is typically one strip per page in\n   multi-page TIFF-F files. See Sections 2.1.2 and 2.1.3.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub4sub2\"></a><h3>4.4.2. Bit Order</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   The current TIFF specification [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>] does not require a Baseline\n   TIFF reader to support FillOrder=2, i.e. lowest numbered 1-bit pixel\n   in the least significant bit of a byte. It further recommends that\n   FillOrder=2 be used only in special purpose applications.\n\n   Facsimile data appears on the phone line in bit-reversed order\n   relative to its description in ITU-T Recommendation T.4.  Therefore,\n   a wide majority of facsimile applications choose this natural order\n   for data in a file. Nevertheless, TIFF-F readers must be able to read\n   data in both bit orders and support FillOrder values of 1 and 2.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub4sub3\"></a><h3>4.4.3. Multi-Page</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   Many existing applications already read TIFF-F-like files, but do not\n   support the multi-page field.  Since a multi-page format greatly\n   simplifies file management in fax application software, TIFF-F\n   specifies multi-page documents (NewSubfileType = 2) as the standard\n   case.\n\n   It is recommended that applications export multiple page TIFF-F files\n   without manipulating fields and values.   Historically, some TIFF-F\n   writers have attempted to produce individual single-page TIFF-F files\n   with modified NewSubFileType and PageNumber (page one-of-one) values\n   for export purposes.  However, there is no easy way to link such\n   multiple single page files together into a logical multiple page\n   document, so that this practice is not recommended.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub4sub4\"></a><h3>4.4.4. Compression</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   In Group 3 facsimile, there are three compression methods which had\n   been standardized as of 1994 and are in common use. The ITU-T T.4\n   Recommendation [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>] defines a one-dimensional compression method\n   known as Modified Huffman (MH) and a two-dimensional method known as\n   Modified READ (MR) (READ is short for Relative Element Address\n   Designate). In 1984, a somewhat more efficient compression method\n   known as Modified Modified READ (MMR) was defined in the ITU-T T.6\n   Recommendation [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.6, Facsimile coding schemes and coding control functions for group 4 facsimile apparatus, November 1988\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.6\">T.6</a>]. MMR was originally defined for use with Group 4\n   facsimile, so that this compression method has been commonly called\n   Group 4 compression.  In 1991, the MMR method was approved for use in\n   Group 3 facsimile and has since been widely utilized.\n\n   TIFF-F supports these three compression methods. The most common\n   practice is the one-dimensional Modified Huffman (MH) compression\n   method.  This is specified by setting the Compression field value to\n   3 and then setting bit 0 of the T4Options field to 0.  Alternatively,\n   the two dimensional Modified READ (MR) method, which is much less\n   frequently used in historical TIFF-F implementations, may be selected\n   by setting bit 0 of the T4Options field to 1.  The value of Bit 2 in\n   this field is determined by the use of fill bits.\n\n   Depending upon the application, the more efficient two-dimensional\n   Modified Modified Read (MMR)compression method from T.6 may be\n   selected by setting the Compression field value to 4 and then setting\n   the first two bits (and all unused bits) of the T6Options field to 0.\n   More information to aid the implementor in making a compression\n   selection is contained in Section 4.5.2.\n\n   Baseline TIFF also permits use of Compression=2 to specify Modified\n   Huffman compression, but the data does not use EOLs. As a result,\n   TIFF-F uses Compression=3 instead of Compression=2 to specify\n   Modified Huffman compression.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub4sub5\"></a><h3>4.4.5. Example Use of Page-quality Fields</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   Here are examples for writing the CleanFaxData, BadFaxLines, and\n   ConsecutiveBadFaxLines fields:\n\n     1.  Facsimile hardware does not provide page quality\n         information: MUST NOT write page-quality fields.\n     2.  Facsimile hardware provides page quality information, but\n         reports no bad lines.  Write only BadFaxLines = 0.\n     3.  Facsimile hardware provides page quality information, and\n         reports bad lines.  Write both BadFaxLines and\n         ConsecutiveBadFaxLines.  Also write CleanFaxData = 1 or 2 if\n         the hardware's regeneration capability is known.\n     4.  Source image data stream is error-corrected or otherwise\n         guaranteed to be error-free such as for a computer generated\n         file:  SHOULD NOT write page-quality fields.\n\n   TIFF Writers SHOULD only generate these fields when the image has\n   been generated from a fax image data stream where error correction,\n   e.g. Group 3 Error Correction Mode, was not used.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub4sub6\"></a><h3>4.4.6. Practical Guidelines for Writing and Reading Multi-Page TIFF-F\n            Files\n      </h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   Traditionally, historical TIFF-F has required readers and writers to\n   be able to handle multi-page TIFF-F files.  Based on the experience\n   of various TIFF-F implementors, it has been seen that the\n   implementation of TIFF-F can be greatly simplified if certain\n   practical guidelines are followed when writing multi-page TIFF-F\n   files.\n\n   The structure for a multi-page TIFF-F file will include one IFD per\n   page of the document.  In this case, this IFD will define the\n   attributes for a single page. A second simplifying guideline is that\n   the writer of TIFF-F files SHOULD present IFDs in the same order as\n   the actual sequence of pages.  (The pages are numbered within TIFF-F\n   beginning with page 0 as the first page and then ascending (i.e. 0,\n   1, 2,...). However, any field values over 4 bytes will be stored\n   separately from the IFD. TIFF-F readers SHOULD expect IFDs to be\n   presented in page order, but be able to handle exceptions.\n\n   Per [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>], the exact placement of image data is not specified.\n   However, the strip offsets for each strip of image are defined from\n   within each IFD.   Where possible, another simplifying guideline for\n   the writing of TIFF-F files is to specify that the image data for\n   each page of a multi-page document SHOULD be contained within a\n   single strip (i.e. one image strip per fax page). The use of a single\n   image strip per page is very useful for applications such as store\n   and forward messaging, where the file is usually prepared in advance\n   of the transmission, but other assumptions may apply for the size of\n   the image strip for applications which require the use of \"streaming\"\n   techniques (see section 4.4.7).  In the event a different image strip\n   size guideline has been used (e.g. constant size for image strips\n   that may be less than the page size), this will immediately be\n   evident from the values/offsets of the fields that are related to\n   strips.\n\n   A third simplifying guideline is that each IFD SHOULD be placed in\n   the TIFF-F file structure at a point which precedes the image which\n   the IFD describes.\n\n   In addition, a fourth simplifying guideline for TIFF-F writers and\n   readers is to place the actual image data in a physical order within\n   the TIFF file structure which is consistent with the logical page\n   order.  In practice, TIFF-F readers will need to use the strip\n   offsets to find the exact physical location of the image data,\n   whether or not it is presented in logical page order.\n\n   If the image data is stored in multiple strips, then the strips\n   SHOULD occur in the file in the same order that the data they contain\n   occurs in the facsimile transmission, starting at the top of the\n   page.\n\n   TIFF-F writers MAY make a fifth simplifying guideline, in which the\n   IFD, the value data and the image data to which the IFD has offsets\n   precede the next image IFD. However, this guideline has been relaxed\n   (writers MAY rather than SHOULD use it) compared to the other\n   guidelines given here to reflect past practices for TIFF-F.\n\n   In the case of the minimal mode, which is also the minimal subset of\n   Profile S, the SHOULD's and MAY's of these guidelines become SHALL's\n   (see Section 3.5).\n\n   So, a TIFF-F file which is structured using the guidelines of this\n   section will essentially be composed of a linked list of IFDs,\n   presented in ascending page order, which in turn each point to a\n   single page of image data (one strip per page), where the pages of\n   image data are also placed in a logical page order within the TIFF- F\n   file structure.  (The pages of image data may themselves be stored in\n   a contiguous manner, at the option of the implementor).\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub4sub7\"></a><h3>4.4.7. Use of TIFF-F for Streaming Applications</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   TIFF-F has historically been used for handling fax image files in\n   applications such as store and forward messaging where the entire\n   size of the file is known in advance.  While TIFF-F may also possibly\n   be used as a file format for cases such as streaming applications,\n   assumptions may be required that differ from those provided in this\n   section (e.g., the entire size and number of pages within the image\n   are not known in advance).  As a result, a definition for the\n   streaming application of TIFF-F is beyond the scope of this document.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub5\"></a><h3>4.5. Implementation Warnings</h3>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub5sub1\"></a><h3>4.5.1. Uncompressed data</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   TIFF-F requires the ability to read and write at least one-\n   dimensional T.4 Huffman (\"compressed\") data.  Uncompressed data is\n   not allowed. This means that the \"Uncompressed\" bit in T4Options or\n   T6Options must be set to 0.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub5sub2\"></a><h3>4.5.2. Encoding and Resolution</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   Since two-dimensional encoding is not required for Group 3\n   compatibility, some historic TIFF-F readers have not been able to\n   read such files.  The minimum subset of TIFF-F REQUIRES support for\n   one dimensional (Modified Huffman) files, so this choice maximizes\n   portability.  However, implementors seeking greater efficiency SHOULD\n   use T.6 MMR compression when writing TIFF-F files.  Some TIFF-F\n   readers will also support two-dimensional Modified READ files.\n   Implementors that wish to have the maximum flexibility in reading\n   TIFF-F files should support all three of these compression methods\n   (MH, MR and MMR).\n\n   For the case of resolution, almost all facsimile products support\n   both standard (98 dpi) vertical resolution  and \"fine\" (196 dpi)\n   resolution. Therefore, fine-resolution files are quite portable in\n   the real world.\n\n   In 1993, the ITU-T added support for higher resolutions in the T.30\n   recommendation including 200 x 200, 300 x 300, 400 x 400 in dots per\n   inch based units.  At the same time, support was added for metric\n   dimensions which are equivalent to the following inch based\n   resolutions: 391v x 204h and 391v x 408h.  Therefore, the full set of\n   inch-based equivalents of the new resolutions are supported in the\n   TIFF-F writer, since they may appear in some image data streams\n   received from Group 3 facsimile devices.  However, many facsimile\n   terminals and older versions of  TIFF-F readers are likely to not\n   support the use of these higher resolutions.\n\n   Per [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>], it is permissible for applications to treat the following\n   XResolution values as being equivalent: &lt;204,200&gt; and &lt;400,408&gt;.  In\n   a similar respect, the following YResolution values may also be\n   treated as being equivalent: &lt;98, 100&gt;, &lt;196, 200&gt;, and &lt;391, 400&gt;.\n   These equivalencies were allowed by [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>] to permit conversions\n   between inch and metric based facsimile terminals.\n\n   In a similar respect, the optional support of metric based\n   resolutions in the TIFF-F reader (i.e. 77 x 38.5 cm) is included for\n   completeness, since they are used in some legacy TIFF-F applications,\n   but this use is not recommended for the creation of TIFF-F files by a\n   writer.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub5sub3\"></a><h3>4.5.3. EOL byte-aligned</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   The historical convention for TIFF-F has been that all EOLs in\n   Modified Huffman or Modified READ data must be byte-aligned. However,\n   Baseline TIFF has permitted use of non-byte-aligned EOLs by default,\n   so that a large percentage of TIFF-F reader implementations support\n   both conventions. Therefore, the minimum subset of TIFF-F, or Profile\n   S, as defined in Section 3 includes support for both byte-aligned and\n   non- byte-aligned EOLs; see Section 3.2.2.\n\n   An EOL is said to be byte-aligned when Fill bits have been added as\n   necessary before EOL codes such that EOL always ends on a byte\n   boundary, thus ensuring an  EOL-sequence of a one byte preceded by a\n   zero nibble: xxxx0000 00000001.\n\n   Modified Huffman encoding encodes bits, not bytes. This means that\n   the end-of-line token may end in the middle of a byte. In byte\n   alignment, extra zero bits (Fill) are added so that the first bit of\n   data following an EOL begins on a byte boundary. In effect, byte\n   alignment relieves application software of the burden of bit-\n   shifting every byte while parsing scan lines for line-oriented image\n   manipulation (such as writing a TIFF file).\n\n   For Modified READ encoding, each line is terminated by an EOL and a\n   one bit tag bit.  Per [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>], the value of the tag bit is 0 if the\n   next line contains two dimensional data and 1 if the next line is a\n   reference line.   To maintain byte alignment, fill bits are added\n   before the EOL/tag bit sequence, so that the first bit of data\n   following an MR tag bit begins on a byte boundary.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub5sub4\"></a><h3>4.5.4. EOL</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   As illustrated in FIGURE 1/T.4 in [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>], facsimile documents encoded\n   with Modified Huffman begin with an EOL, which in TIFF-F may be byte-\n   aligned. The last line of the image is not terminated by an EOL.  In\n   a similar respect, images encoded with Modified READ two-dimensional\n   encoding begin with an EOL, followed by a tag bit.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub5sub5\"></a><h3>4.5.5. RTC Exclusion</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   Aside from EOLs, TIFF-F files have historically only contained image\n   data. This means that applications which wish to maintain strict\n   conformance with the rules in [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>] and compatibility with\n   historical TIFF-F, SHOULD NOT include the Return To Control sequence\n   (RTC) (consisting of 6 consecutive EOLs) when writing TIFF-F files.\n   However, applications which need to support \"transparency\" of [<a title=\"ITU-T Recommendation T.4, Standardization of group 3 facsimile apparatus for document transmission, October 1997\" href=\"chapter11.html#T.4\">T.4</a>]\n   image data MAY include RTCs if the flag settings of the T4Options\n   field are set for non-byte aligned MH or MR image data.  Implementors\n   of TIFF readers should also be aware that there are some existing\n   TIFF-F implementations which include the RTC sequence in MH/MR image\n   data. Therefore, TIFF-F readers MUST be able to process files which\n   do not include RTCs and SHOULD be able to process files which do\n   include RTCs.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub5sub6\"></a><h3>4.5.6. Use of EOFB for T.6 Compressed Images</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   TIFF-F pages which are encoded with the T.6 Modified Modified READ\n   compression method MUST include an \"end-of-facsimile-block\" (EOFB)\n   code at the end of each coded strip. Per [<a title=\"Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, Adobe Developers Association, June 3, 1992, ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/devrelations/ devtechnotes/pdffiles/tiff6.pdf The TIFF 6.0 specification dated June 3, 1\" href=\"chapter11.html#TIFF\">TIFF</a>], the EOFB code is\n   followed by pad bits as needed to align on a byte boundary. TIFF\n   readers SHOULD ignore any bits other than pad bits beyond the EOFB.\n</pre>\n      \n      <a name=\"sub6\"></a><h3>4.6. Example Use of TIFF-F</h3>\n      \n      <pre>\n   The Profile F of TIFF (i.e. TIFF-F content) is a secondary component\n   of the VPIM Message, as defined in [<a title=\"Vaudreui,l G. and G.
