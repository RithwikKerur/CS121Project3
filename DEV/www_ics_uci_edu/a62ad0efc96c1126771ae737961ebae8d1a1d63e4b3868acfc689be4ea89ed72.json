Applications in astronomy need fast tools for\noutlier detection in data sets that have unknown distributions, are\nlarge in size, and are in high dimensional space.  Existing algorithms\nfor outlier detection are too slow for such applications.  We present\nan algorithm based on an innovative use of <I>k</I>-d trees that doesn't\nassume any probability model and is linear in the number of objects\nand in the number of dimensions.  We also provide experimental results\nthat show that this is indeed a practical solution to the above\nproblem.\n<P>\nThis talk is based on work done jointly with\nAlex Szalay and Andrew Moore.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
