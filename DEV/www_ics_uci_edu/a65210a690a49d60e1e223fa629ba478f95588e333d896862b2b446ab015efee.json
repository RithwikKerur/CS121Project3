It also covers storage allocation and memory\nmanagement techniques. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Prerequisites:</b> ICS 22/ CSE22 with a grade of C\nor better or Engineering EECS40; Mathematics 6A or ICS 6A. Same as\nCSE23. Only one course from ICS 23/CSE23 and ICS H23 may be taken for\ncredit. \n\n<p>\n<b>Last drop date:</b> The end of the fifth week of class.\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"title\">Instructor Information</p>\n\n<ul class=\"nomarker\">\n  <li><b><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~goodrich/\">Michael Goodrich</a></b></li>\n  <li>Office: DBH 4216</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><b>Office hours:</b> W F, 2:00pm-3:00pm (or appt. by request)\n\n\n<p><b>Contacting me:</b> I tend to be much easier to reach via email\nthan by phone, so I would suggest using email to contact me under\nnormal circumstances.  When you write me an email, please take a few\nmoments to make sure that the following information is placed somewhere\nin your message: your name, your student ID#, and which course you're\nenrolled in (as I'm teaching more than one).</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Times and Places</p>\n\n<p>The lecture meets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 9:00am-9:50am \nin DBH 1500.\nAttendance at lecture is <b>required</b> of all students.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlthough participation in the lab section is of \ngreat benefit to the student, it is <b>not required</b>.</p>\n\n<p>There are two lab sections, led by the TA, as discussed below.\nParticipation in a lab section is not strictly required, but it is\n<b>strongly encouraged</b> of all students.\n</p>\n\n\n<hr />\n<p class=\"title\">Lab Sections</p>\n\n<p>In order to be enrolled in ICS 23, you must be enrolled in both a\nlecture and a lab.</p>\n\n<p>Your lab time is 80 minutes twice a week during which you will be\nguaranteed a seat in the lab, even if the lab is busy.  Your TA will be\navailable during this time to answer your questions as you work on your\nprojects.  On some occasions, your TA will gather you together -- in\nwhole or in groups -- to discuss the projects.  Other times, it will\nsimply be open lab time.  You're also welcome to ask questions about\nlecture material, if you'd like.  \nYour attendance in your lab section\nis not an explicit requirement of the course.\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Textbook</p>\n\n<ul class=\"nomarker\">\n  <li> <a href=\"http://java4.datastructures.net/\">\n  <i>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, 4th Edition</i></a></li>\n  <li>by Michael T. Goodrich and Roberto Tamassia</li>\n  <li>John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 2004</li>\n  <li>ISBN 0-471-46983-1</li>\n  <li><b><i>REQUIRED</i></b></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may also find it useful to purchase a Java reference book.  If you took an introductory programming course using Java (e.g. ICS 21), you'll probably find your textbook from that course to be sufficient as a reference.  If not, there are many suitable ones out there, and different styles will appeal to different people, so I suggest going to a local bookstore and finding one that you feel comfortable with.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<p class=\"title\">Grading</p>\n\n<p>Your course grade will be determined from the weighted combination\nof your scores on each of five projects, one Midterm, and one Final\nExam.  The weights of each of these are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Lecture attendance, 5%</li>\n  <li>Five programming projects, 35% (weighted equally at 7% each)</li>\n  <li>Two midterms, 30% (weighted equally at 15% each)</li>\n  <li>Final Exam, 30%</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Course grades will be determined neither on a normal curve nor a\nstraight scale.  \nNevertheless, overall scores over 90% will\nreceive an A- or better, scores over 80% will receive a B- or better,\nand scores over 70% will receive a C or better.  However, the actual\ncutoffs may be lowered at the end of the quarter.\n</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n\n<p class=\"title\">Academic dishonesty</p>\n\n<p>As ICS 23 students, you are expected to know and follow the academic\ndishonesty policies of both the ICS Department and the University as a\nwhole.  Please take a few minutes to read the policies, which can be\nfound at <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ucounsel/continuing_students/policies.html\">this\nlink</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All of your work in this course is expected to be completed \n<b>solely by you</b>.  \nGroup work and/or sharing of code between students is not\npermitted, nor are students allowed to have someone other than\nthemselves perform the work.  \nNote that \"high-level discussion of course material for\nbetter understanding\" is permitted and encouraged, but when it comes\ntime to sit down and write code, that is expected to be done by you and\nyou alone.  All submissions are compared to one another using a\nsophisticated plagiarism detection system.\nThis system is extraordinarily\ngood at finding similarities between submissions, even when there are\nsuperficial differences.  (Note that we also compare your submissions\nto those submitted during previous quarters whenever one of these\nassignments was given during a previous quarter, so it is an\nexceedingly bad idea to turn in, or even refer to, code written by a\nfriend of yours who took the course already.)</p>\n\n<p>Since all of your work is expected to be completed solely by you,\nyou will be held responsible even if you plagiarize only a small\nportion of someone else's project.</p>\n\n<p>Academic dishonesty is a two-way street.  Providing your code to\nother students for them to turn in as their own is not permitted\nanymore than turning in someone else's code.  Resist the temptation to\ngive code to your friends \"for reference.\"  Based on my experience, I\ncan say that your \"friends\" may very well betray you and turn it in,\nanyway.</p>\n\n<p>Violators of academic dishonesty policies are subject to the\npenalties described in the ICS Department's policy.  They are also\nsubject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed\nto drop the course to avoid the grade.  Also be aware that a single\ndocumented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching\ninto an ICS major, registering for an ICS minor, joining the ICS\nHonors Program, and graduating from ICS with honors.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
