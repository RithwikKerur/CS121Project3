Some of its good features:\n<ul>\n<li> There are many links to other documents, and the anchor words are\n     all well-integrated into the flow of the document.\n<li> It's about the right length, 4 or 5 screenfuls.\n<li> It uses HTML features such as italics, headings, and lists.\n<li> The tone is serious but lively.\n<li> Unfortunately, there is a typo in the document.\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n\nAnother good model is Bertrand Ibrahim's and Steve Franklin's \n<a HREF=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/doc/WWW95/aeuw3.html\">\nAdvanced Educational Uses of the World-Wide Web</a>.\nThis paper is written in a more academic style than is December's;\nthere's an Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion, Footnotes, and\nBibliography. You can follow this format if you want to, but it's\nnot necessary.  Unfortunately, there is a serious split infinitive\nin this document.\n\n<hr>\n\nHere are some criteria we will use in assessing final project.\n\n<h2>Spelling and Proofreading</h2>\nThere should be no indication that\nyou wrote the document two hours before it was submitted, even if\nthat was the case.  A tip: at the ea> prompt, enter \n<code>spell doc.html</code>\nwhere <var>doc.html</var> is the name of your document.  All words not in the\ndictionary will be listed.  There will be many false positives, but\nall misspelled words will be listed as well.  Note that the \n<code>spell</code>\ncommand is <strong>not</strong> a substitute for careful proofreading!\n\n<h2>Style and tone</h2>\nYour document should be thoughtful, serious and\nlively.  Try to avoid cliches, hyperbole, unsupported opinions,\nslang, jargon, and passive sentences.\n\n<h2>Take advantage of what HTML has to offer</h2>\nHTML offers hypertext\nlinks to other documents, of course; but there's much more:\n<ul>\n<li>internal links (beginning with #);\n<li>ordered and unordered lists;\n<li>inline .gif pictures\n<li>a variety of type styles, such as bold or italic (use very judiciously);\n<li>different levels of heading;\n<li>a descriptive and helpful title (would a search engine that just\n   looked at words in the title find your document when it should?).\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Appropriate breadth of topic</h2>\nYour topic should not be too broad or too narrow.  If it's too broad,\nit may end up merely being a survey of a subject area.  If it's too\nnarrow, you may have trouble finding enough references and enough things\nto say.  Try to minimize the survey and overview part of your document\n(although a few paragraphs may well be appropriate) and emphasize\nthe analysis and critique part of the document.\n\n<h2>Interesting and thoughtful content</h2>\nMany of us have had the pleasant\nexperience of coming across a \"mother-lode\" document, one which provides\na useful overview of a subject area, expresses opinions arising from\na distinct and well thought out point of view, and is chock full of\nlinks to related documents.  You should aim to produce a document of\nthis nature.\nYour document should go far beyond being a\nhotlist of URLs you have run across.\n<P>\nAlthough the format of this assignment is not question and answer, \nit may be useful to formulate several questions about your topic and\nwrite your document so that those questions are answered.\nYou may want to answer some of the following questions (I offer these\nonly to provoke your thoughts; there is no requirement to ask or answer \nthese specific questions):\n<ul>\n<li>How has your subject matter been affected by WWW?\n<li> What will be the relationship between WWW and your subject\n     matter in 2 years?\n<li> What types of people are interested in both WWW and your\n     subject matter?  Professionals?  Academics?  Students?  Home\n     computer users?\n<li> How can some of the elements of your topic (you have to figure\n     out what this means) be arranged along a spectrum?  How can\n     they be compared to each other?\n<li> How can the URLs you have found be categorized?\n<li> What are the main controversies on this topic?  What is your\n     stance on these controversies?\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Interesting links</h2>\nAs far as possible, your links should be to \ndocuments which are themselves interesting.  Prefer primary sources\nover secondary ones (e.g., if you were writing on WWW search engines,\nit would be better to link to Lycos and The Harvest Project than to\nDecember's New Spiders article).  \nIf you are <strong>not</strong> writing about search engines, then\ndon't mention them; this document is not about how you found the\nURLs you link to.  (Of course, there could be an exception to this\nrule, if the path to the link was germane to your topic.)\n<p>\nThe five URLs you submitted with \nyour proposal should just be a starting point -- ideally you'll have\nmany more, not all directly related to your topic (see the December\nand Franklin documents for examples).\n\n<h2>Reasonable length</h2>\nA document written by one person\nshould be between 1000 and 2000\nwords -- about 4 to 6 screenfuls.  Documents with more than one author\nshould be longer, of course.\n\n<h2>More than one author</h2>\nGenerally, if there are multiple authors we will expect a longer\nand higher quality paper.  The norm will be that all authors will \nreceive the same score.  \n\n<p>\n\n<h2>*********************************************</h2>\n<h2>MOST IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT OF ALL:</h2>\nNormal considerations of academic honesty are in effect for this\nresearch project.  All words and ideas which are not your own must be\nproperly attributed, just as in every other research paper you have\never written or will ever write.\n<h2>*********************************************</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<i>Hope this helps!
