but,\r\n  it will move at a quick pace, so be prepared to work hard and struggle a bit\r\n  with the material.\r\nAlso, the material we cover needs to be understood so it can be applied in\r\n  novel situations, not just memorized.\r\n<p>\r\nThe intellectual content of this course can be neatly divided into three \r\n  main subject areas: Algorithmics, Abstraction, and Analysis (the triple-As):\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>Algorithmics: tokens, simple types, literals, names/variables, objects,\r\n          expressions, exceptions, and control structures.\r\n    <li>Abstraction: functions, compound types (strings, lists, sets, maps,\r\n           ... classes), methods, modules.\r\n    <li>Analysis: equivalence, pragmatics, aesthetics (style), correctness\r\n          (testing/debugging), efficiency (big-O notation), and numerical\r\n          accuracy.\r\n   </ul>  \r\n<p>\r\nThe main programming methodology that we will learn and employ is\r\n   iterative-enhancement, which decomposes a large project into a series of\r\n   mini-projects (each is called a phase).\r\nStarting from a kernel, and writing a program for each of these phases in\r\n   sequence, results in a solution to the original project.\r\nEach phase requires repeatedly specifying, designing, coding, documenting,\r\n   testing, debugging, and evaluating a testable program (or new or enhanced\r\n   function to use in the program) that is a small extension of the\r\n  capabilities of the program (or function) produced in the previous phase.\r\n<p>\r\nHere is a quick overview of the the three programming class in UCI's three\r\n  quarter Introduction to Programming sequence.\r\nAll are taught in Python, and the combined time-on-task studying and\r\n  programming with this language should make students proficient in using it.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>ICS-31: Introduction to Programming.\r\n    This course introduces the basics of the Python programming language and\r\n      how to develop programs in an Integrated Development Environment\r\n      using Python.\r\n<li>ICS-32: Programming With Software Libraries.\r\n    This course increases students' abilities to write more complicated\r\n      programs; it focuses on students learning how to read, understand, and\r\n      employ modules from Python's library.\r\n<li>ICS-33: Intermediate Programming.\r\n    This course examines Python more carefully, giving students a more unified\r\n      look at the language and discussing some of its powerful features that\r\n      make sophisticated programming easier.\r\n    It also covers some programming related Computer Science topics.\r\n</ol>\r\nA quick way to analogize these courses is: 31: learning to drive; 32: road\r\n  trips; 33: car mechanics.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough we will mostly study <i>programming-in-the-small</i>, we will\r\n  concentrate on the technical and lingual issues of building large,\r\n  reliable programmed systems that are constructed from standard components.\r\nExpect to cover most relevant Python language features thoroughly, but also\r\n  to spend much time discussing the less concrete -but ultimately more\r\n  general and important- aspects of programming.\r\nProgramming style is a particularly important topic: to understand\r\n  programming, we really need to develop appropriate aesthetics that allow\r\n  us to separate \"elegant\" programs from \"hacks\".\r\nAs in any writing activity, we must also learn to be self-critical of our own\r\n  creations, so that we can continually improve them; this skill is difficult\r\n  to acquire, and its importance extends well beyond the domain of\r\n  programming.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, to become an expert in any discipline, we must master its\r\n   terminology.\r\nFluency with technical terms allows us to communicate -and even to think-\r\n   more accurately and concisely.\r\nTherefore, the materials in this course will define, illustrate, and\r\n   repeatedly use many important technical terms concerning programming.\r\nTake the time required to master them. An old Chinese proverb says,\r\n     \"The first step towards wisdom is calling things by their right names.\" \r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Textbook -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Textbook\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>. \r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Textbooks</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThere is no required textbook for this course.\r\nThe primary sources for ICS-31 will come from materials that I have\r\n  written (and am continually updating).\r\nThese materials include readings, problem sets, quizzes, and programming\r\n  assignments (and a bunch of infrastructure material, like this syllabus).\r\nTypically, these materails will be shorter than chapters in a textbook, but\r\n  they are more densely packed with information;

I know that this is asking a lot, but the payoff for\r\n  recognizing the situation and acting on it immediately is tremendous.\r\nThe primary reason that students fail to thrive in programming courses is that\r\n  they fall behind in their work -often because of what is initially a small\r\n  misunderstanding; but, because of the cumulative nature of this course,\r\n  even a small misunderstanding can quickly grow into a big one.\r\nOften, I can quickly diagnose and rectify such a problem one-on-one.\r\nGetting help fast can critically affect your overall performance in\r\n  this course: many times I've seen students start performing one grade\r\n  level higher after coming in to get help during my office hours.\r\n<p>\r\nUnfortunately, I teach ~400 students during a typical quarter, so my time is\r\n  a bit limited.\r\nBut please come visit if you need help so we can try to work things out.\r\nOf course, you can also talk to your TA and Lab Tutors during your labs, where\r\n  resources and time are not so tight.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Online Hours -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"OnlineHours\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width =\"20%\"><b>Instructor<br>Online Hours</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nI hold online hours every weekday evening before class/lab meets: Monday,\r\n  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday  evenings from 9:00pm-10:00pm.\r\nI will be logged  onto AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) as <b>richardepattis</b>\r\n  during these times.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you are not already a member of AIM (or a similar service that can message\r\n  AIM users)  <a href=\"http://www.aim.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sign Up</a> for\r\n  this service (it is free).\r\nUsing this system, you will be able to Instant Message me, as well as use\r\n   an audio (voice) connection if you have a headset with a microphone.\r\nYou can IM me with questions;

Sorry to bother you.\"\r\nThis works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners.\r\nOne university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.\r\nStudents with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before\r\n  they could speak to a human counselor. \r\n<p align=\"right\"><i>- B. Kernighan & D. Pike\r\n  (in \"The Practice of Programming\" pp. 123)</i></p></td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\nTalking about programming is important.\r\nOne of the reasons that we program in pairs is to always have someone who you\r\n  can to talk to about your code; unlike the teddy bear, someone who has an\r\n  interest in getting your code to work, and who might supply relevant feedback.\r\n<p>\r\nI try to answer email every few hours during the day.\r\nI normally will not answer email sent after about 10:00pm until early the next\r\n  morning (but I'll typically answer it by the next morning).\r\nIf you have problems late at night that you cannot resolve, please send me\r\n  email (or post on the relevant forum) summarizing your problems, and then go\r\n  to work on something else (or if it is really late, go to sleep).\r\nBy planning to finish assignments early, you can protect yourself against a big\r\n  problem that arises at night and cannot be fixed until the next day: you\r\n  really don't want to have to fix such a problem the night that an assignment\r\n  is due.\r\n<p>\r\nFor most problems -ones that are of general interest to the class- I would\r\n  prefer that you ask the question using a MessageBoard forum (see below).\r\nIn this way, everyone in the class can see the question and its answer\r\n  (which I might provide, or a a TA/Lab Tutor, or another student).\r\nOne of the few advantages of a big class is having lots of student activity on\r\n  such forums, leading to peer-instruction.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, the Electronic Educational Environment (EEE) at UCI creates and\r\n  maintains course-wide mailing lists.\r\nI have created a \"merged\" mailing list for all my ICS-31 students (which also\r\n  includes those students signed up for CSE 41, both in the Sammueli School of\r\n  Engineering and the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science).\r\nAll members of our course (staff and students) can use this mailing list, whose\r\n  email address is <b>ics31-S14@classes.uci.edu</b>\r\nAll messages sent via this discussion list are archived: click\r\n  <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/classmail/s14/36540/\" target=\"main\">\r\n    here</a> or see the <b>Email Archive</b> link on the course website.\r\nMostly student-initiated questions/discussions should use the forums mentioned\r\n  below, but sometimes students can use this email list to inform the\r\n  instructor, staff, and other students about some timely issue: e.g., the\r\n  Checkmate Homework Dropoff system not responding to program submissions.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Bboard -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"Bboard\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\"

on the EEE MessageBoard.\r\nThese forums allow students to ask questions (or start discussions) easily, as\r\n  well as supply answers (or participate in the discsussion further).\r\nFor example, if a lecture note, programming assignment, etc. contains unclear\r\n  (or even contradictory) information, post a note about it to the appropriate\r\n  forum, asking for a clarification.\r\nI, or someone from my staff will read and reply to whatever questions are\r\n  asked.\r\nIn fact, if you read a question on a forum, and know the answer -or generally\r\n  have something to contribute to the topic- I encourage you to to post a reply\r\n  to help resolve the problem even sooner.\r\nThus, you can use the forums to discuss any course materials out-of-class.\r\n<p>\r\nAgain, forums are appropriate for questions relevant to most students in the\r\n  course; directly email me (see above) for questions of a more\r\n  individualistic nature.\r\nObviously students should not use these forums to solicit nor post answers to\r\n  take-home quizzes, programming assignments, or anything else that would be\r\n  interpreted as academic misconduct (which is discussed in greater detail\r\n  below).\r\nBut general informational questions and answers are fine.\r\nI often find that students send me individual email when they should be\r\n  posting on a forum; think before you decide which

<b>understanding</b> means \"be able to use the information operationally\r\n  to write programs\".\r\nIf you have difficulty with a problem, it indicates that you should probably\r\n  go back over the related reading -or certainly ask a question about it on the\r\n  Forum.\r\nOne of the few advantages of a big class like this is the potental for\r\n   peer-teaching.\r\n<p>\r\nBecause these problems are not graded, feel free to discuss them, but don't\r\n  give away the answers for those still working on them: working on exercises\r\n  like these builds your programming muscles.\r\nStudents will be required to solve similar problems on (almost) weekly\r\n  take-home quizzes, on which collaboration is NOT allowed.\r\nDon't cheat yourself in this aspect of the

is oral: where you describe the problem,\r\n  possibly showing your code briefly, and then get an oral answer that you\r\n  understand and translate into code.\r\nIn such instances, you are learning. \r\n<p>\r\n<b>You may neither copy nor transcribe (written or orally) any parts of another\r\n    student's program, nor have another student sit down and systematically\r\n    correct your

and debugging them.\r\nStudents who complete their programs in this way will be well prepared for\r\n  the In-Lab Programming Exams; students who get too much help (on purpose,\r\n  or accidentally) from their programming partners or others will have a more\r\n   difficult time on these exams, which can severely impact their grade.    \r\n<p>\r\nYou will submit your solutions to programming

#0.\r\n<p>\r\nTo promote good time management skills, if you submit a program at least 24\r\n  hours  before it is due, you will receive 1 point of extra credit.\r\nIf you submit a program 48 hours early, you will receive 2 points.\r\nYou can gain no more than 2 points of extra credit by early submission.\r\nFor a 45 point assignment, this extra credit is equivalent to almost half a\r\n  letter grade improvement.\r\nIn general, it is a bad idea to submit programs more than 48 hours early\r\n  (typically we will return graded programs on Monday, and you should wait to\r\n  receive them and see how they are grades before submitting your new program).\r\n<p>\r\nI know from long teaching experience that students who work ahead of the\r\n  deadlines learn more, in a less stressed envrionment: students working right\r\n  up to a deadline are more concerned with getting the right answer and less\r\n  concerned with learning anything.\r\nOn the other side of this coin, I will not accept any late programs.\r\nSo, you must turn in your work on time: if you turn in a partially working\r\n  program on time, it will receive partial credit; if you do not turn in\r\n  anything on time, then I must assume you did no work on the program, and you\r\n  will receive no credit.\r\nTherefore, always turn in whatever work you have finished by the official due\r\n

=\"20%\"><a name=\"Policy\"><b>Policy</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nThe decision as to whether a student has cheated depends on the intent of an\r\n  assignment, the ground rules specified by the instructor, and the behavior of\r\n  the student. \r\nThe following two guidelines help an instructor decide if cheating has\r\n   occurred on programming, which is the fuzziest area:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if an assignment that calls for independent\r\n         development and implementation of a program results in two or more \r\n         solutions so similar that one solution can be converted to the\r\n         other(s) by a series of simple transformations.\r\n  <li> Plagiarism will be suspected if a student who completed an assignment \r\n         cannot explain both the intricacies of the solution and \r\n         the techniques used to generate that solution.\r\n</ul>\r\nIt is unreasonable to expect a complete definition of cheating that would cover\r\n  all cases, because each situation is important enough to merit careful,\r\n  individual scrutiny; however, it is helpful to have guidelines and\r\n   precedents.\r\n<p>\r\nHere are some examples that are clearly cheating and clearly not cheating.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Examples of CHEATING</b>:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Turning in someone else's work, in whole or in part, as your own (with or\r\n        without his/her knowledge), without it including a statement of\r\n        collaboration in the solution.\r\n  <li>Allowing another student to turn in your work, in whole or in part, as\r\n        his/her own, without it including a statement of collaboration in the\r\n        solution.\r\n  <li>Turning in a completely duplicated assignment.\r\n      Even if all the comments are changed, all the variables names are\r\n        changed, all the whitespace is changed, and the code appears in a\r\n        different order: it is still the same program.\r\n  <li>Several students/pairs writing one assignment and turning in multiple\r\n        copies, all represented (implicitly or explicitly) as an individual\r\n        student's/pair's work, without it including a statement of\r\n        collaboration in the solution.\r\n  <li>After receiving graded written work, returning written work, for\r\n        regrading, which has been altered.\r\n  <li>Finding a solution to the same problem on the web and submitting it\r\n        without explicit attribution in the solution.\r\n  <li>Stealing an examination or solution from the instructor.\r\n</ul>\r\nGenerally, you should NOT EXAMINE, by reading hardcopy or by copying a file,\r\n  the program of any other student (nor should you let anyone examine or make\r\n  a copy of your files).\r\nDoing so can easily lead to an intended or unintended academic violation.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you ever feel that after talking to someone about a program, which is legal,\r\n  your solution will be very similar to theirs, cite the consultation in the\r\n  header comment in your program.\r\nDoing so protects you from University disciplinary action (although the\r\n  instructor is free to grade the material as he/she sees fit).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Examples of NOT CHEATING</b>:\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Turning in work done alone or with the help of the course's staff.\r\n  <li>Submitting one assignment for a group of students if group work is \r\n        explicitly permitted (or required, as in pair-programming).\r\n  <li>Getting or giving help about using the computers.\r\n  <li>Getting or giving help about solving syntax errors.\r\n  <li>High level discussions of course material to better understand them.\r\n  <li>Discussing assignments to better understand them.\r\n</ul>\r\nAgain, the key here is not studying, verbatim, someone else's code, and then\r\n  reproducing it as your own work.\r\nIt is too easy to copy such code without really understanding it.\r\nTechnically, for programming assignments, even understanding the resulting code\r\n  is not enough (if someone else wrote it): you should also play an active role\r\n  in synthesizing and debugging it.\r\nThe course is as much about skills as about knowledge.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" rules=\"none\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr valign=\"top\">\r\n<td width

available.\r\nSome use search engines to compare selected portions of submitted papers to\r\n  content on the web.\r\nIn the context of programming, they compare each student's program to those\r\n  submitted by his/her classmates (for this quarter, and any previous\r\n  quarters if the assignment has been repeated).\r\nThis software does not compare programs exactly: it ignores format changes,\r\n  variable name changes, and a variety of well-know transformations that\r\n  change the look of code but not its underlying logic.\r\n<p>\r\nMany courses in ICS use this software to spot potential cheating cases.\r\nOnce it identifies suspicious behavior, instructors carefully examine the\r\n  flagged code to make a final determination as to whether students will be\r\n  prosecuted for cheating.\r\nOften instructors can find additional evidence of cheating, once this\r\n  software points them to the simlar code.\r\n</td>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<table

occurred.\r\nIf, in the instructor's opinion it has, the instructor will apply appropriate\r\n  disciplinary policy.\r\nIn my courses, for a typical case of cheating, the student will be awarded\r\n  negative credit for the assignment (under the precept that not doing an\r\n  assignment, and receiving no points, is better than cheating on it).\r\nFor particular egregious forms of cheating (e.g., cheating on exams, stealing\r\n  another student's work so he/she cannot submit it for credit), harsher\r\n  consequences may apply (from loss of a full letter grade, through immediate\r\n  failure of the course, up through suspension or expulsion from UCI).\r\n<p>\r\nInstructors must contact the student shortly after investigating evidence of\r\n  academic dishonesty and evaluating the relevant work.\r\nNotice of any action taken by an instructor will also be forwarded to the\r\n  Associate Dean of Student Affairs (ADSA) in ICS, the ADSA of the student's\r\n  home school (if different).\r\nThese offices act as a repository for such information, in case the student\r\n  commits multiple infractions.\r\nWhile the first infraction often results in just a grading penalty, a

name=\"FinalWords\"><b>Final Words:<br>A Personal Statement</b></td>\r\n<td width =\"80%\">\r\nCheating undermines the fabric of education.\r\nThe atmosphere at UCI (contrary to whatever opinions, prejudices, or\r\n  superstitions you hold) is one of fostering cooperation between faculty and\r\n  students in the pursuit of learning, knowledge, and wisdom.\r\nThis course, for example, is graded on an absolute scale, not a curve;\r\n  so, helping other students doesn't affect your grade.\r\nAnd, if a student cheats for a higher grade, other students do not receive\r\n  lower grades as a result.\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough it is embarrassing to fail an assignment, getting caught cheating is\r\n  much worse (and some students get caught cheating for very few points).\r\nI know, though, that students rarely think about getting caught.\r\nBut think about it: I often see students break down and cry when they get\r\n  caught cheating and only then start to realize the consequences of their\r\n  actions.\r\nTheir stress level goes through the roof and it immediately affects both the\r\n  academic and social aspects of their lives.\r\nThe process is distressing for me too, although I must confess that I have been\r\n  hardened by the number of times that I have had to go through it (typically\r\n  multiple times each quarter).\r\nPursuing these cases at the University level takes a lot of my time, and\r\n  reduces the time that I can spend on more important matters relating to my\r\n  course and my students.\r\nIt is definitely a lose-lose situation.\r\n<p>\r\nThe #1 excuse that I hear for cheating is, \"I was pressed for time, so I\r\n  cheated.\"\r\nBy carefully managing your time, you can avoid this problem.\r\nIf you start working early enough, and run into problems (and you should expect\r\n  to run into problems), you will have time for the course staff to help you\r\n  learn to solve them.\r\nAlso, I understand that some students take this course only because it is a\r\n  requirement for their major, and that they have little intrinsic interest in\r\n  the subject area; this is not a valid excuse for cheating either.\r\n<p>\r\nI have seen too many instances recently where student A asks a friend, student\r\n  B, for help; specifically, A asks to see B's quiz or code (on paper or in a\r\n  computer file).\r\nOften, A copies B's code (with or without B's knowledge).\r\nI understand that B feels pressure to give A help.\r\nBut, B is doing A no favor if A's cheating is discovered; B has made a bad \r\n situation (A would receive no credit) worse (A receives negative credit and is\r\n  reported to the Dean of Student Affairs).\r\nAnd, according to UCI's rules, B is violating the Academic Integrity policy\r\n  by these actions too.\r\nI have seen friendships shattered because A copies B's code without telling B\r\n  what was done, and then both get prosecuted under UCI's rules.\r\n<p>\r\nA similar situation arises with cheating on quiz questions.\r\nI have seen too many students cheat on one question on a quiz and receive a\r\n  negative score for the whole quiz (and letter to the Dean of Student\r\n  Student Affairs), when leaving the question blank would result in a small\r\n  point deduction and no university action.\r\n<p>\r\nIn my final statement here, I ask you to pause and reflect on the consequences\r\n  of choosing to cheat at UCI: this includes the impacts that it will have on\r\n  you, your parents, your siblings, your friends, and your fellow classmates\r\n  at UCI.\r\nCheating is invariably the wrong decision.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Policy Exceptions -->\r\n\r\n<a name=\"PolicyExceptions\">\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\"
