The ultimate result is likely to be a\nsoftware tool that recognizes conflicts between demands for group\nawareness information and for privacy, and helps group members\nnegotiate a compromise.\n<p>\nContact: <a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kobsa>Alfred Kobsa</a>\n\n<h4>Privacy as a Design Requirement</h4>\n<p>\nPrivacy demands of Internet users as well as international (and future\nnational) privacy legislation have an impact on the collection of\npersonal data in web-based systems. This project studies specifically\nthe impacts on \"personalized\" web-based systems, which cater their\ninteraction to each individual user, collect considerable amounts of\npersonal data for this purpose, and \"lay them in stock\" for possible\nfuture adaptation. This project analyzes and documents these privacy\nrequirements.\n<p>\nContact: <a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kobsa>Alfred Kobsa</a>\n\n<h4>Success Factors of Information Visualization Systems</h4>\n<p>\nResearch in information visualization aims at leveraging human\nperceptual abilities for data analysis, by presenting information not\nas numbers and text but in visual form. Effective visual displays must\ntherefore be designed in such a way that users can easily obtain an\noverview of the data, spot outliers, patterns and correlations, and\nsee the changes that will occur if some parameters become\naltered. Visualizations need to make such significant facts salient\nfor human perception. This identifies \"success factors\" of\nvisualization systems for multivariate data, by conducting experiments\nboth with analysts working individually on a computer screen, and with\ngroups of analysts collaborating in front of a large-sized display.\n<p>\nContact: <a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kobsa>Alfred Kobsa</a>\n\n<h4>Software Visualization</h4>\n<p>\nSoftware systems are large, complex artifacts over which many people\nwork. The effectiveness of cooperation between developers depends on\ntheir understandings of the structure and operation of the code base,\nand the activities of their colleages. However, conventional software\ntools don't focus explicitly on these problems of software\nunderstanding. We're exploring the use of visual properties to explain\nboth the static and the dynamic properties of large software systems.\n<p>\nContact: <a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jpd>Paul Dourish</a>\n\n<h4>Security and Usability</h4>\n<p>\nIn many systems, security and usability seem to be opposite design\nconcerns; making systems more secure seems to make them less\nusable. However, usability is critically important for security,\nbecause a system is only as secure as the way that it's used, and the\nway that it's used depends on how users understand and approach\nit. Based on studies of how people manage security in software systems\nas an everyday, practical problem, we're developing new models that\nwill help people understand security concerns in the systems that they use.\n<p>\nContact: <a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jpd>Paul Dourish</a>,\n<a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles>David Redmiles</a>\n\n<h4>Fluid Information Spaces</h4>\nConventional information systems force people to organize their\ninformation according to fixed structures such as hierarchies and\ndatabase schemas. By contrast, in everyday activity, the ways that\npeople work with information are much more fluid. Information\norganization emerges from how people interact with information, rather\nthan being predefined, and different people have different ways of\norganizing the same information.\n<p>\nWe are looking at ways to build information systems that provide\nbetter support for informal information management for personal, group\nand organizational work. This includes both information\ninfrastructures based on attribute storage models, and novel\ninteraction approaches such as spatial hypertext.\n<p>\nContact: <a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jpd>Paul Dourish</a>\n\n<h4>Expertise Recommendation</h4>\nExpertise networks are technical augmentations of the ad-hoc social\nnetworks that enable people to answer questions, accomplish tasks, and\nfind information. Technologies to create, enhance, and maintain these\nnetworks will be important uses of the Net. We have been conducting\nstudies into expertise seeking in technical organizations, and\ndeveloping prototype technologies that reflect our findings.\n<p>\nContact:\n<a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ackerman>Mark Ackerman</a>,\n<a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lutters>Wayne Lutters</a>\n\n<h4>Organizational Memory</h4>\nInformation technology has enabled organizations to generate and\nretain mountains of information. Unfortunately, many organizations\nsuffer from \"infoglut.\" They have the information they need, but they\ndon't know they have it. Or, knowing they have it, they can't find\nit. From the perspective of the organization, one method of managing its\nintellectual resources is to attempt to augment its organizational\nmemory. If an organization learns, then the result should be\navailable later. \n<p>\nA standard connotation of organizational memory, that that can\ncaptured in a written record, is only one form of organizational\nmemory. The most obvious places include information repositories such\nas corporate manuals, databases, filing systems, and even\nstories. Additionally, individuals are a prime location for retention\nof the organization's knowledge. However, organizational memory can be\nretained in many other places, including organizational culture,\nprocesses, and structures. \nThus, information technology can support organizational memory in two\nways, either by making recorded knowledge retrievable or by making\nindividuals with knowledge accessible. Our work has been concerned\nwith both possibilities.\n<p>\nContact: <a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ackerman>Mark Ackerman</a>\n\n<h4>Information Needs in Health Care</h4>\nWe focus on collaborative information seeking in health care\norganizations. \nOur goal is to understand the roles that technology and organizational \nnorms play in helping determine when and how information is sought and\nused \nby groups and individuals. We closely examine the relationship between\nthe \ninformation seeking methods of the various health-care workers and \ntechnologies such as the computer-based patient record. The findings\nfrom \nour fieldwork will be used to design systems that support\ncollaborative \ninformation seeking by patient care teams.\n<p>\nContact:\n<a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~pratt>Wanda Pratt</a>,\n<a target=_top href=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mreddy>Madhu Reddy</a>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
