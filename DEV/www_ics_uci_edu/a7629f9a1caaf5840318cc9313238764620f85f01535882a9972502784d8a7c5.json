The\ncommon approach is to fire a ray from the point and count the\nnumber of intersections with the boundary curve. The point is\ncontained if the number of intersections is odd. We present certain\ndifficulties that occur with this approach, which are due to\ntolerancing issues, and present an alternative, based on the\nwinding number, which is a tool from the theory of functions of\ncomplex variables. It is shown that for points far from the\nboundary, the winding number calculation is highly reliable, but\nthat difficulties arise, using standard integration methods, near\nthe boundary due to the singular nature of the integrand. Methods\nfor dealing with the difficulties, borrowing ideas from generalized\nfunction theory, appear to lead to a robust implementation. It is\nsuggested that integral equation methods may become an important\ntool in the toolchest of computational geometers in the years to\ncome.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
