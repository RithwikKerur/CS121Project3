Put another way, the course looks at a number of &#147;information literacy&#148; and &#147;computer literacy&#148; issues. The information literacy topics we&#146;ll examine include how to find information, what forms information may take, how to evaluate information for accuracy and reliability and how to present information effectively. Computer literacy topics will include a broad view of how computers work, what they do, how they have developed and how they may affect us now and in the future. \n\n<p>Through computer-based laboratory exercises, you put into practice a number of the concepts and themes discussed in the lectures by grappling with some presentational and representational problems. In the course of doing these labs, you will also gain experience with software tools you will likely be using in your other coursework and in the workplace.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"CourseStructure\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Overview of course structure</h3>\n</div>\n<p>ICS 10A has three components: lecture, discussion section, and priority lab section (\"lab,\" for short). To be enrolled in ICS 10A, you must be enrolled in the lecture and the disucssion section and in one of the lab sections.</p>\n\n<p>Discussion is where you meet in smaller groups where you can ask your Teaching Assistant  (TA) questions about lectures or the lab assignments in a classroom setting.</p> \n\n<p>Priority lab is where you can work on lab assignments and where you\ntake the lab exams; the TA will be present to answer questions. You are\nguaranteed a seat in the discussion section and the priority lab in which\nyou are enrolled and, subject to the restrictions given below, you may\nalso attend other sections. We cannot stress enough the importance of going to your priority lab: it is where you will have the equipment, software, and in-person assistance helpful in completing your assignments.</p>\n\n<p>Your attendance at lecture, discussion or lab will not be taken into account when determining your grade. However, if you are absent from discussion or lab, the TA will not repeat just for you what s/he publicly told your section, because this repetition unfairly burdens the TA and takes the TA&#146;s time and expertise away from other students. We suggest that you arrange with your classmates to borrow their notes.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<a name =\"Enrolling\"></a>\n<h3>Enrolling in ICS 10A</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>To be enrolled in ICS10A, you must be enrolled in lecture, discussion\nand one (and only one) of its lab sections.\n\n<p>Procedures for dropping the class, changing your lab section, petitioning to add the class, changing your grade option and related matters are discussed in \n<a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/EnrollmentInformation.html/\">\nEnrollment Information</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Information\"></a>\n<h3>Important information</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Please keep this information at hand; it likely will come in very handy during the quarter!</p>\n\n<center><table border width=\"438\" >\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"42%\"><font class=\"normal\">Jacobson&#146;s office</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"58%\"><font class=\"normal\">CS 408A</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"42%\"><font class=\"normal\">Office Hours</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"58%\"><font class=\"normal\">Tues. &amp; Thurs. 2:00 to 3:15 pm</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"42%\"><font class=\"normal\">Jacobson&#146;s phone</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"58%\"><font class=\"normal\">949-824-7300</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"42%\"><font class=\"normal\">Jacobson&#146;s email address</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"58%\"><font class= \"codeFaceSmall\">jacobson@uci.edu</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"42%\"><font class=\"normal\">Jacobson&#146;s home page</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"58%\"><font class = \"codeFaceSmall\">www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson</font></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"42%\"><font class=\"normal\">Questions to course staff</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"58%\"><font class = \"codeFaceSmall\">10a-questions@ics.uci.edu</font></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Lecture, Discussion and Lab Meetings</b></p>\n\n<table border width=\"450\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\"><font class=\"normal\">ICS10A lecture course code:</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\"><font class=\"normal\">36210</font></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\"><font class=\"normal\">Meeting time and place:</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\"><font class=\"normal\">Tu & Th 11:00 - 12:20 pm, CS 174</font></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p></p>\n<table border width=\"450\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\"><font class=\"normal\">ICS10A discussion course code:</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\"><font class=\"normal\">36211</font></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"60%\"><font class=\"normal\">Meeting time and place:</font></td>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"40%\"><font class=\"normal\">Mon 1:00 - 1:50 pm, CS 174</font></td>\n</tr>\n</table></center>\n<p></p>\n<br>\n<center><table border width=\"520\">\n<tr>\n<td valign=TOP width=\"7%\"><font size=-1>Course Code</font></td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"7%\"><font size=-1>Lab No.</font></td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"7%\"><font size=-1>Days</font></td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"12%\"><font size=-1>Priority Lab Time</font></td>\n\n<td valign=TOP width=\"7%\"><font size=-1>Pri.

You may also use the computers in CS 364, our first-come, first-served open-to-all-students lab. </p>\n\n<p>CS 183 is available to you during your priority lab section. It is also open to you during other ICS10A priority lab times, provided there is a vacant seat, and the person in charge of the section has not prohibited visitors. You <i>must</i> give up your seat if someone who has priority during that time needs it. </p>\n\n<p>You may not use a first-floor lab when a non-ICS10A class is in session.</p>\n\n<p>You can use a first floor lab during \"open hours,\" that is, when no class is using the room. First floor labs are closed on University holidays.</p>\n\n<p>You may also use the computers in CS 364. The same computers and software that are available in the first-floor labs are available in CS 364&#151;but there is no course staff on duty. </p>\n\n<p>The scheduled lab hours and open hours times for all lab rooms are posted\non the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/labs_specs/hours.php\">ICS Lab hours web page</a>, and often on the labs&#146; doors.</p>\n\n<p>A lab attendant in each lab watches over equipment and can answer questions about your computer account, help you try to revive a \"dead computer,\" add toner or paper to a printer and the like. <i>An attendant cannot help you with your ICS 10A work. </i> Tell the lab attendant if you find a piece of lab equipment that is broken or otherwise needs attention, or you think someone is trying to steal or damage software or equipment.</p>\n\n<p><b>Printing:</b> We do not require printouts in this class, so you only need a printout if you wish one for your own purposes. To use the printers in the ICS labs, which are part of the Network and Academic Computing Services (NACS) PayPrint system, you'll need to obtain a \"PayPrint card.\" The \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/\">ICS Lab web site</a>.\nexplains how to get one (and gives other details about the\nPayPrint system). You are free, of course, to print on any printer to which\nyou have legitimate access.</p>\n\n<p>If you find a piece of lab equipment that is broken\nor otherwise needs attention, or you think someone is trying to steal or\ndamage software or equipment, tell the lab attendant on duty.</p>\n\n<p> <b>Additional information</b> about the lab rooms, their equipment and software is in the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/LabManual/02-OrientationToLab.html\">Orientation to the Lab</a> section of the <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/LabManual/00-LabManual.html\">ICS10A Lab Manual</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Accounts\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Activating your UCInetID and ICS Windows computer accounts</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>UCI provides all its students with basic computing,\nincluding electronic mail and worldwide Internet services, via a \"UCInetID\"\ncomputer account. All ICS 23 students need this account: if you have not\nyet activated your UCInetID, go to <a href=\"http://activate.uci.edu/activate/menu.html\">UCInetID Activation & Password Changers</a>. Click on <font class=\"codeFaceSmall\">I want to activate my UCInetID</font> and follow the instructions. Be sure to have your student ID and social security number handy; you'll need them to complete the activation process.</p>\n\n<p>You will also need an ICS Windows computer account\nto use the computers in lab. If you are already enrolled in the course, or an ICS major, the ICS Department has created your account. If you adding the class (and are not an ICS major), your account will be created a day or two after your petition is received. In brief, you activate your ICS Windows account by bringing your UCI student ID card (and yourself!) to the lab attendant in CS 364. Your ID will be verified; you then take an on-the-computer quiz about the rules regarding use of ICS computer resources and provide a password. Your account is then ready for use. For details on activating ICS accounts, see the <a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/students/acct_activate.php\">Instructions for Account Activation</a> Web page.</p>\n\n<p>While waiting for your account to be activated, you can use our &#147;guest account&#148;;\n<i>xxx</i> is the user name (login ID) and <i>xxx</i> is the password (the \"0\" characters are zeroes). Obviously, the account is public, \nso don&#146;t store any personal information or work there (copy it to a memory stick or elsewhere and delete it from the hard drive right before you log out).</p>\n\n<p>The account will expire about April 21, so be sure to activate your own account by then. (Adds will be processed by this date.)</p>\n\n<p>At the same time your Windows account is activated,\nyou&#146;ll also receive an ICS Unix account that has the same login name and\npassword. We won&#146;t use that account for this class, but it is a good place\nto store a backup of your computer work.</p>\n\n<p>Explicit instructions for activating a Windows\naccount, and more details about your Unix account, are provided at the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/\">ICS Lab web site</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"LabUse\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Lab Use Policies</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p> In order to use our computer equipment and computer\naccounts, you must agree to abide by UCI&#146;s and ICS&#146; policies regarding\nthem. The documents that describe these policies are kept on the Web; perhaps\nthe best way to access them is from the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/policies/labguidelines.php\">ICS Instructional Lab Rules</a> web page.

You can also ask questions by sending\nemail to <font class=\"codeFaceSmall\">10a-questions@ics.uci.edu</font>. (If you do not know how to use UCI's email, ask your TA during priority lab for some pointers.) Course staff checks this email address regularly and will\nrespond to your question within a few hours (somewhat less frequently on\nweekends and holidays). If the response to your question would be complex\nor lengthy, we may provide a short response and ask you to meet with me\nor the TA for a more in-depth discussion.</p> \n\n<p>You can get in touch with me or the TA individually by electronic mail to their personal email address (listed above). But the best strategy for getting a quick answer to a course-related question is to send an electronic message directly to <font class=\"codeFaceSmall\">10a-questions@ics.uci.edu</font>. This goes to all course staff, so you are likely to get a faster repsonse. </p>\n\n<p>Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation based on \n  the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss \n  his or her specific needs.  Also contact the Disability Services \n  Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to better ensure that \n  such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a question or comment of a personal or private nature, please email your TA or me directly, or see the appropriate party in person.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Announcements\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Keeping up with course announcements</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Throughout the quarter, we post messages of general interest to the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/Announcements.html\">ICS10A\nannouncements</a> Web page. \nBe sure to read it regularly.</p>\n\n<p>We send urgent or particularly important announcements\nby email to your UCInetID account.

In brief, Office and SecureCRT and\nmust be licensed (for a fee); Internet Explorer and IrfanView are free.</p>\n\n<p>You will probably want a couple of 3.5\" diskettes or a &#147;memory stick&#148; storage devices we recommend as\nthe primary way to back up your work.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Grades\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Course assignments, exams, and their grading</h3>\n</div>\n\n\n<p><i>Lab assignment</i>: The Lab Manual describes these; 35% of the course grade</p>\n<p><i>One midterm</i>: 30% of the course grade</p>\n<p><i>One final exam</i>: 35% of the course grade</p>\n\n<p>See the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/CourseSchedule.html\">\nCourse Schedule</a> \nfor the dates of the exams.</p>\n\n<p>Your grades will be posted on UCI's <a href=\"http://eee.uci.edu\">Electronic Educational Environment (EEE)</a> web site. (If you have not previously used EEE to look up your grades, it's quite straight-forward. Just go to EEE, sign in to MyEEE, and follow the instructions for viewiing course grades.) The TA will review in lab how each assignment was graded (except for the last assignment, which is due after lab sections have finished). </p>\n\n<p>To help you study for the exams, we have placed on the course web site a set of midterm exam and set of final exam study questions&#151; the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/MidtermStudySheet.doc\">Midterm Exam Study Sheet</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/FinalStudySheet.doc\">Final Exam Study Sheet</a>. Feel free to contact the TA or me to verify your answers to these questions.</p>\n\n<p>If you think an assignment was graded incorrectly, discuss your concerns with the TA. If you have questions about how your exams were graded, see me. Please bring us your grading questions within a week after the item is returned, so we have sufficient time to resolve the matter. In any event, you must contact us before the final; UCI rules prohibit regrading of work once the class ends.</p>\n\n<p>&#9;We will assign final grades on <i>at least</i> the following scale; the cutoffs may be (and often have been) lower: Grades in the A range (A&#150;, A, and in exceptional cases, A+), 80% and above; grades in the B range, 70%&#150;79%; grades in the C range, 60%&#150;69%; grades in the D range, 50%&#150;59%; and F grades below that. Using an established point scale means that you are not graded in direct competition with your classmates. </p>\n\n<p>A reader will be assisting the TA with assignment grading. To compensate for differences in grading that can occur when different people grade, we will examine each grader&#146;s scores statistically and increase proportionally the scores of students whose grader averages were lower than the grader with the highest average. The result will be that the average number of assignment points lost for each grader will be the same. </p>\n\n<p>Your midterm answer sheet will be available for review in your lab section the week after the exam is given (you must return it to the TA when you leave the room). Your final exam answer sheet will be available at my office a few days after the exam; schedule an appointment with me to review it. </p>\n\n<p>Final course grades, the scores used to compute\nthem, a number of statistics about the class and related end-of-quarter\nmatters will be available on the course Web page soon after the course is over.\nFollow the links to <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/CourseGrades.html\">Course Grades</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/ics10A/NoteOnGrades.html\">A Note on Course Grades</a> to access that information.</p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"Cooperation\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>About cooperation</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>You are expected to know and follow the academic dishonesty\npolicies of both ICS and the UCI. Do\ntake a few minutes to read the policies, which can be found (among other\nplaces) at the\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php?policy=cheating\">ICS</a> and <a href=\"http://www.senate.uci.edu/9_IrvineManual/3ASMAppendices/Appendix08.html\">UCI</a> academic honesty policies Web pages.\n\n<p>In addition to those rules, there are some specific rules regarding student-with-student cooperation in this class:\n\n\n<p>On lab assignments, the work you turn in must be your own. You may not have another person write part of your lab or let someone plan the detailed strategy you will use to attack the problem. You may ask other students for help on technical matters, such as how to use Office features or interpret an error message. You may, of course, get help from the TA and the instructor: they are informed about what sort of help is allowable, so feel free to ask them any question you have (but they may decline to answer it if it means they would be doing your work for you). You may also use data and programs we provide to you. When specifically allowed by a lab exercise, you may also adapt for use in your work information given in texts or other sources, but you must also credit the source of that information in your assignment.</p> \n\n<p>On exams, you must do your own work: Using answers from another source, such as a student sitting near you at the exam, is a particularly serious infraction of academic honesty rules.</p>\n\n<p>A violation of these rules will be considered academic dishonesty and dealt with accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>If you are unsure whether certain behavior is acceptable, ask before you engage in it.</p>\n \n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name = \"GettingStarted\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>What to do to get started in ICS10A</h3>\n</div>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#149;  Read this Course Reference, its attached documents, and the Web documents it references.\n<p>&#149;  Get a couple of diskettes or a memory stick to back up your work.\n<p>&#149;  Get a copy of the textbook.\n<p>&#149;  Get a print card (if you plan to use lab printers).\n<p>&#149;  Download a copy of the Lab Manual.\n<p>&#149;  Activate your UCInetID.\n<p>&#149;  Activate your ICS account.\n<p>&#149;  As needed, learn about email and our lab set-up, and become comfortable with basic computing skills needed to begin the lab exercises, as described in the Orientation to Lab section of the Lab Manual.\n<p>&#149;  Begin working on Lab 1.\n</blockquote>\n\n<div class = \"section\">\n<a name = \"Advice\">\n<hr>\n<h3>Good advice and helpful hints</h3>\n</div>\n\n\tGood advice and helpful hints: Make every effort to attend the lectures; we will make important announcements and often cover a significant amount of material that isn&#146;t in the textbook.

I will not repeat a lecture you missed, though\nof course I will answer questions about it. You may audio tape lecture,\nprovided you use it only to study for this course.\n\n\t<p><i>Attend the discussion section</i>; lectures and exams will be reviewed there, and you can ask more questions there than you can in lecture.</p>\n\n\t<p><i>Attend your priority lab</i>, too; assignments will be discussed there, you can ask questions about the assignments and, importantly, learn of any special requirements or grading criteria the TA has established.</p>\n\n<p><i>Keep up with the reading</i>; you&#146;ll need it to do your assignments, and the quarter system goes so fast that a few missed pages can quickly become a few chapters if you\u00b9re not careful. But don&#146;t try to memorize everything the first time you read it through; read for the broad ideas and refer back to the text for reference as needed.</p>\n\n\t<p><i>Start early doing the lab assignments; computer work always takes longer to complete than you think it will</i>, even if you have previous experience: pitfalls, stumbling blocks and unexpected difficulties are an inevitable part of computing. Start early; work consistently. <i>Do not wait for your lab section to meet to begin work on an assignment</i>; all information necessary to get started on each lab is in the lab manual.</p>\n\n<p><i>Keep a backup of every completed assignment.</i> If an assignment should get lost (such as because of a file server crash), we expect you to be able to supply a replacement copy quickly.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ISO-8859-1"}
