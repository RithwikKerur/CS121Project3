Situational\r\nawareness refers to knowledge about the unfolding crisis\r\nevent, the needs, the resources, and the context. Accurate\r\nassessment of the situation is vital to enable first responders\r\n(and the public) to take appropriate actions that can have\r\nsignificant impact on life and property. Consider, for instance,\r\na situation of a large structural fire wherein teams of fire\r\nfighters enter into a burning building for search and rescue.\r\nKnowledge of the location of fire fighters, their physiological\r\nstatus, the ambient conditions and environment are critical for\r\nthe success and safety of both the victims and fire fighters.\r\nAppropriate situational awareness is critical not just at\r\nincident level, but at all levels of response. For instance,\r\nknowledge of occupancy levels, the special needs of the\r\npopulace, the road-closures, the geographical scope of the\r\ndisaster (e.g., the fire perimeter), etc. play a vital role in\r\nevacuation and shelter planning and in organizing medical\r\ntriage.\r\n\r\nThe importance of accurate and actionable situational\r\nawareness in crisis response is now well recognized [1] and\r\nhas led to significant research on appropriate sensing,\r\nnetworking, sensor processing, information sharing, data\r\nmanagement, and decision support tools. The research team at\r\nthe UC Irvine, Center for Emergency Response Technologies\r\n(CERT) has been extensively involved in working with a\r\nvariety of first responder organizations to build a variety of\r\nsuch tools in the context of the NSF funded RESCUE\r\n(Responding to Crises and Unexpected Events) project [2]\r\nand the DHS funded SAFIRE project [3]. Our experience\r\nworking with rescue personnel has clearly established that\r\nwhile sensors (including motes, video, physiological, location,\r\nenvironmental) are important, speech is undoubtedly the\r\nsingle most important source of situational information. The\r\nvery first point of contact of citizens with the responders\r\nduring an emergency is through a telephone call to the 911\r\ndispatch system. In case of large disasters that involve a larger\r\nteam of responders (such as a fire-fighting team), the primary\r\nmechanism used for communication and coordination among\r\nresponse teams is through radios carried by the first\r\nresponders. Such conversations contain perhaps what\r\nconstitutes the most important situational information that has\r\ndirect implications on the efficacy of the response. Despite\r\nimportance of speech, today, assimilation of situational\r\ninformation from speech is almost entirely done manually.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<BR>\r\n<H4>Categories and Subject Descriptors</H4>\r\nH.2.m [<B>Database Management</B>] Miscellaneous - Situational Awareness;<BR>\r\nI.2.7  [<B>Natural Language Processing</B>]: Speech recognition and synthesis;<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H4>Keywords</H4>\r\nSpeech Processing, Situational Awareness, Crisis Response\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<p>\r\n<H4>Downloadable Files</H4>\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/EMWS09_dvk.pdf\">EMWS09_dvk.pdf</A><BR>\r\nPresentation: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/EMWS09_dvk.ppt\">EMWS09_dvk.ppt</A><BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?EMWS09_dvk\" width=1 height=1>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<H4>BibTeX Entry</H4>\r\n<pre>@inproceedings{EMWS09::dvk,\r\n   author    = {Dmitri V.
