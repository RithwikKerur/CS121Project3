Is\nthere a stable glider eater? Or a stable glider mirror?</p>\n\n<p>One of the most common chaotic growth seeds is the boat, V, or W\npentomino (all different phases of the same pattern). Can this\npattern be stabilized and made to follow tracks formed by still\nlifes or oscillators, the way the Herschel can in life?</p>\n\n<p>Which still lifes, oscillators, and spaceships can be\n<a href=\"construct.html\">synthesized</a> by glider crashes\nor <a href=\"puffer.html\">produced by puffers</a>?</p>\n\n<p>Which other <a href=\"glider.html\">spaceships</a> can be shot from\n<a href=\"guns.html\">guns</a>? Is it possible to\nmake a spaceship gun in which none of the intermediate patterns is\na glider?</p>\n\n<p>There exist stable infinite patterns with density at least 80%\n(compared to life for which the maximum density is 50%). Can such\ndensity be achieved in a finite stable or oscillating pattern? Is\nthere a finite pattern which grows to fill space at this\ndensity?</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"/~eppstein/ca/b35s236/\">B35/S236</a> -- <a href= \n\"/~eppstein/ca/\">Cellular Automata</a> -- <a href=\"/~eppstein/\">D.\nEppstein</a> -- <a href=\"/\">UCI Inf. &amp; Comp.
