But for now, \r\nthere's no indication that either Congress or the courts are \r\nabout to accept this argument.<P>\r\nAs we saw, things that are written down electronically are \r\njust as protected by copyright as things that come out on \r\npaper.  Likewise, copying something in cyberspace can be \r\njust as much an infringement - assuming the copyright owner \r\ndoesn't allow you to do it - as copying something on paper:<P>\r\n<UL TYPE=disc>\r\n<LI>If you download an article from a newspaper Web site and forward it to a news group, you've made copies, which might be infringements.<P>\r\n<LI>If someone saves your e-mail in an archive, he's made copies, which might be infringements.<P>\r\n<LI>If you quote someone's newsgroup post in your response to the post, you've made copies, which might be infringements.<P>\r\n</UL>\r\nIn some of these situations, the copies might be legal, \r\neither because they are EXPLICITLY ALLOWED by the copyright \r\nowner (you might have seem some online documents which \r\nspecifically allow readers to copy them), because they are \r\nFAIR USES or, because they are allowed by IMPLIED LICENSES. \r\nWe'll talk more about this later.<P>\r\nBut they are definitely copies, and therefore potential infringements:<P>\r\n<UL TYPE=disc>\r\n<LI>If a work is COPYRIGHTED (which, as we saw, is an easy hurdle to jump),<P>\r\n<LI>and you've made a COPY of it (which we'll talk about more below),<P>\r\n<LI>and you weren't authorized to do so -- authorized by the copyright owner's express permission, by an implied license, or by the fair use doctrine -<P>\r\n<LI>then you've violated the copyright law.\r\n</UL><P>\r\n<BR>authors:\r\n<TABLE CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>\r\n<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Larry Lessig</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>David Post</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Eugene Volokh</TD></TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<BR>\r\n<CENTER>\r\n<HR SIZE=\"3\" WIDTH=\"65%\">\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"../csl_lessons.html\">Back to Lesson Index</A>\r\n</CENTER>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\">\r\nCopyright \u00a9 1999 Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc.
