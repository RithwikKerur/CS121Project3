Just about a \ndecade ago, computers existed but were not widely implemented in the \nclassroom.  Today, however, children in the first grade are very aware of \ncomputers and are computer literate.  This is the computer generation.  \nKids in malls are now playing with the computers displayed at Sears or \nRadio Shack with great ease.  Now computers are taking a new step by \ntaking an active part in education.  In reality, it is not so new since \npilot projects have been out there for a number of years, but now almost \nevery school has at least one computer on their campus.\n<p>  Computers are now being tied to education and are used as tools to benefit the learning \nprocess.  In fact computers have revolutionized <A \nHREF=\"http://www.gse.uci.edu/\"><B>education</b></A> by bringing in new teaching \nmethods that are current with the rapid technological changes.  We are begining \nto explore what we can call the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the \npotential computers and the internet has in aiding the classroom environment. <A \nHREF=\"gopher://ericir.syr.edu/00/Lesson/Science/cecsci.03\"> Science</A> and <A \nHREF=\"gopher://ericir.syr.edu/00/Lesson/Math/cecmath.08\"> math </A> \nhave been the focus of many internet projects and lesson plans for teachers are \navailable on line thru the internet. Many agencies have taken an interest on how \nthe internet can be use and are exploring the posibilities of appling the use of \nthe net to  every subject taught in school.  For example <A \nHREF=\"http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasa_online_education.html\">Nasa,</A> and the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.si.edu/\"> Smithsonian Institution </A> have created their \nhome page with a list of sources related to education and the uses of the internet.  \n\n<P>Teachers are no longer working in a classroom alone.  Through the \nnetwork, they are able to exchange lesson plans, communicate with other \neducators, and compare methodology.  We are now hitting a new era of <A \nHREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org:90/edref.connection.html\"><b>Educational \nReform and Computers.</b></A>  In fact, the University of Houston has \nestablished a <A \nHREF=\"gopher://state.virginia.edu/00/TEIS/About_STATE_dir/Introduction\"><i> \nteacher education internet server. \n</i></A>  This server provides access \nto an internet gopher ( these are documents stored int he net which may \ncontain sound and images) and discussion groups (these are interactive \ndiscussions in the Internet).  Teachers here can be informed of the \nlatest developments.\n<P>With the teachers being well-informed, they now have to transmit this \nto their classroom.  The Department of Education at UCI has worked with \na project called KIDS-NET.  It is a forerunner of the concept of the \nusage of the Internet in education.  It was funded by National \nGeographic, and the Drug Free Schools of the Department of Education \nconducted these studies.  They had their own central site that was \nassisted by Sprint Net.  Schools subscribe to this privately owned net \nand would get a unit to work with.  The introductory unit was called \nHELLO, and they were hooked up to other schools.  Students would connect \non to this net and have interaction with other schools.  Several schools \nin the United States were connected through this net during the summer.  \nA student from California could compare the rainfall here with a student \nall the way in Texas.  It was aimed at children in the elementary level \nand focused on having students do hands-on work in the sciences.  UCI was \nin charge of administering the  pre and post testing and analyzing the \nstatistical data to ensure that the project was working properly.\n<P>There is now another project out there that schools are using per \nsemester called the <A \nHREF=\"http://clp.berkeley.edu/CLP.html#top\"><b>Computer as Learning \nPartner</b></A> (CLP).  It is an integrated energy curriculum teaching the \nphysical sciences topics of heat, light and sound at the middle school \nlevel.  Schools are now aiming at a hands-on, laboratory-based curriculum \nfor almost all subjects rather than just a text-based curriculum.  \nSchools want more student-teacher interaction, and that is what the <A \nHREF=\"http://clp.berkeley.edu/CLP/General_Information/info.html#Project\">CLP project</A> has to offer.  It is not serving as a substitute for the teacher, but acting as a backbone to the class.  Computers provide the tools that textbooks cannot give to th\ne students.  It emphasizes <A HREF=\"http://clp.berkeley.edu/CLP/CLP_Curriculum/everyday_problems.html\">realistic problems.</A>\nComputers act as partners to the students by providing the components to \nperform experiments and sample models.\n\n<p> New teaching strategies are being developed to complement the use of \ncomputers.  Many fear that by having children sit in frot of a computer to learn \nmay isolate them into a world of their own.  But teaching strategies such as \ncooperative learning and new sources of assessment along with computer usage \ncomplement each other.  Cooperative learning involves student intearction in the \nclassroom.  The teacher is not the only one talking and teaching the lesson.  \nStudents are grouped to work together emphasizing their strong points.  This \ncould be done in every subject.  Teachers are also trying to integrate the \nsubject and not separating math with science and english but making on flow with \nthe other.  Computers can do since it is able to integrate more than one \ntopic.  Finaly the use of new assessment methods such as using a portfolio and \nteaching other children make a difference in learning.  Test can not always tell \na teacher if in fact the student is learning.  Computers help the retention of a \nchild since they see it, read it, explore it, interact with it, and enjoy it.  \n\n\n<P><IMG SRC=\"SAH.logo.icon.gif\" ALIGN=MIDDLE></P>\n<P>Educational use of computers is not limited to the classroom setting, \nbut it could also be integrated in the home. <A \nHREF=\"http://www.lanl.gov/temp/Education/Introduction.html\"><b>Science at \nhome</b></A> was piloted in Spring of 1994, and was presented to families \nto see how each family member can participate in scientific discovery.  \n\n\nComputer usage in education has been quite successful, and will soon \nbecome an essential part of the classroom setting.\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
