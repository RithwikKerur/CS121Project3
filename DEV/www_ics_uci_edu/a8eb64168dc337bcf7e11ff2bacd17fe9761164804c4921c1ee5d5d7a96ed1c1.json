class,\n<dfn>traceability</dfn> is relative to a written document or documents,\nand refers to the ability to determine what the consequences\nof each decision are, and where the consequences are located in the document;\nand what the reasons and rationales for each decision are,\nand where the reasons are located in the document.&nbsp;\nWe will often use traceability to refer to\nthe <i>means</i> by which consequence and reasons are located.&nbsp;\nTraceability of consequences is <dfn>forward traceability</dfn>\nand traceability of reasons in <dfn>backward traceability</dfn>.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nForward and backward traceability correspond, in the simplest case,\nto forward and backward in time as well.&nbsp;\nIn a waterfall model,\neach choice is made before the choices that result from its consequences\nare made.&nbsp;\nIn practice,\nthis usually doesn't happen\nbecause the decision process involves a lot of backtracking.&nbsp;\nWe don't see the full consequences of a decision\nuntil we've explored them and made some decisions based on them.&nbsp;\nOften an earlier decision (in the traceability sense)\nis made on the basis of a later consequence &mdash;\nfor example,\nwe may change a system's goals\nwhen we discover that the code doesn't run fast enough.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI extend traceability to include <i>rejected alternatives</i>,\nand term this <dfn>sideways traceability</dfn>.&nbsp;\nWhile it is possible to make a statement that is simply\nthe first one that occurred to you,\nsuch a one cannot be classed as a thoroughly considered and supported statement.&nbsp;\nEvery statement is (implicitly or explicitly)\na choice from among two or more alternatives,\nthe others of which were rejected for some reason or other.&nbsp;\nThe chosen statement is supported not only by\nthe reasons and rationales behind it,\nbut also by the thoroughness indicated by\nthe range and breadth of rejected alternatives,\nand their rationales, which were deemed less convincing for specific causes.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n\n<h1>Why is traceability valuable and interesting?</h1>\n\n<p>\nOne way of viewing traceability is to think of it as a goal\nusing a metaphor of vision:&nbsp;\nthe goal of having reasons and rationales,\nconsidered but rejected alternatives,\nand consequences all visible\nfrom the point at which a decision is recorded.&nbsp;\nThe advantages of traceability are several, including:&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<ol class='oa'>\n  <li>\n    The previous work of inference and reasoning\n    is not lost, but can be reviewed and reused.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    It is available when each decision\n    is reconsidered\n    (for example, as the system's conception evolves).&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    It is available\n    when a neophyte is first learning about the system\n    and why it is the way that it is.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    If a previously rejected alternative\n    is elevated to primacy later,\n    at least some of its reasons, rationales, and consequences\n    are already present,\n    as are the reasons, rationales, and consequences\n    of the newly rejected choice.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\nHow to achieve traceability?&nbsp;\nIn general,\nit has to be specifically supported.&nbsp;\nExcept for the very smallest requirements specifications,\nthere is too much information\nfor a person to have it all in their head.&nbsp;\nSome way of finding it with assistance is needed.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n\n<h1>How is traceability supported?</h1>\n\n<p>\nThe most straightforward way\nis to do it directly:&nbsp;\nput as much of the traced-to information as possible\nright there with the statement,\nand put pointers to the rest.&nbsp;\nThis works best with rationales and rejected alternatives,\nbecause a set of rationales and rejected alternatives\nusually corresponds to a single statement\nand this correspondence doesn't change over time\n(although the chosen alternative may).&nbsp;\nIt is more problematic with the pointers,\ntypically called <dfn>links</dfn> in this context.&nbsp;\nThese links ramify quickly,\noften change over time\n(because a change in a choice usually corresponds to\na change in the reasons the choice is based on,\nand a change in the consequences of the choice),\nand have to be maintained both forward and backward.&nbsp;\nIn practice, the links frequently deteriorate in salience\nas the decisions evolve and the links are not evolved along with them.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBecause updating the traceability links\nis time-consuming and tedious,\nand thus is error-prone and usually incomplete,\nit is tempting to think of other more flexible approaches.&nbsp;\nSeveral commercial products support the construction and maintenance\nof traceability links.&nbsp;\nOne might imagine\nusing a sophisticated search capability instead of maintained links,\nso that the connections could be easily\nrediscovered and regenerated only as needed,\nrather than updated whenever they change.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nFor the purposes of this course,\nwe will use explicit links,\nnot because they are necessarily the most effective approach,\nbut because they are the most effective in\nshowing your understanding.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n\n<h1>Traceability and consistency</h1>\n\n<p>\nTraceability is related to <dfn>consistency</dfn>,\nthe problem of making a document\nnot state contradictory things.&nbsp;\nOne way of supporting consistency\nis to divide the decisions so that they are orthogonal\nand do not interfere with each other,\nand then state each decision exactly once\n(\"a place for everything, and everything in its place\"),\nand instead of repeating the statement,\nreference it instead.&nbsp;\nTaken to the extreme,\nthis approach ensures consistency\nbecause each thing is only said once,\ntherefore there are no other statements of it\nthat could be inconsistent.&nbsp;\nIn practice, partitioning the decisions so they are orthogonal\nis impractical.&nbsp;\nHowever,\nit is still beneficial to state each decision only once\nand reference it instead of restating it.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n\n<div class='figure'>\n  <img src='img/Traceability.png' alt='tracing relations'/>\n  <p>\n  Fig. 1.&nbsp; Relations among kinds of information\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n\n<h1>The relations among kinds of information</h1>\n\n<p>\nIn general, there is a traceability progression\nfrom stakeholders through goals and requirements to scenarios:&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    each stakeholder has at least one goal\n    (forward)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    each goal belongs to at least one stakeholder\n    (backward)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    each goal is supported by other goals\n    or by one or more requirements\n    (forward)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    each requirement supports at least one goal\n    (backward)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    each requirement is operationalized by at least one scenario\n    (forward)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    each scenario operationalizes at least one goal\n    (backward)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nAnd in general, all of the above have rationales and rejected alternatives,\nand everything is supported by the elicitation data:&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    stakeholders, goals, requirements, and scenarios\\\n    each have a rationale (backward)\n    and one or more rejected alternatives\n    (sideways)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    everything is directly or indirectly connected to\n    an elicitation datum that is its foundation\n    (backward)\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    each elicitation datum supports at least one thing\n    (forward)\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<!--xhtml -n -->\n</div>\n\n</div><!-- #TBg -->\n\n<div id='TFooter'>\n<div class='W3C'>\n  <a
