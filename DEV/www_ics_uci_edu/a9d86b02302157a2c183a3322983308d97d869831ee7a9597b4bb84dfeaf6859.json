The default column headings are\nprobably not what you want to use, so click the \"Edit Columns\"\nbutton (cmd-/ for short) to display the components for changing the\nnumber and names of the columns (screenshot below).</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"screenshot2.png\" width=\"690\" height= \n\"447\" alt=\n\"Screenshot of Tabulizer with edit columns drawer extended\"></div>\n\n<p>You can double-click on any column name in the drawer and type a\nnew name for the column. The tab key moves from one column name to\nthe next. The two buttons allow you to create a new column (on the\nright side of the table) or get rid of the rightmost column. When\nyou are done editing the columns, click the button or press cmd-/\nagain to hide the drawer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>How do I add data to my table?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>To add a new row to your table, simply press return.\nYou can then start typing into the cells of the row, moving from\none cell to the next by the tab key. You can also go back and edit\nany of your old data by double clicking on it and using the\nstandard Mac OS editing commands. When you are done adding data,\nuse the Save command (cmd-S) to store your table to a\nfile.</blockquote>\n\n<h2>My table is in the wrong order. How can I rearrange it?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>Clicking on any column header will sort the rows of the\ntable by the values in that column. Clicking again on the same\nheader will toggle between ascending and descending sorted order.\nIf you wish to rearrange the rows in some unsorted order, \nyou can select some rows, and cut them and paste them into the desired\nposition.\nYou can also rearrange the columns by clicking and dragging them,\nand change the widths of the columns by dragging the boundaries\nbetween the column headers.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>My table is too big to scan by eye.  How can I find the rows I want?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\nIf you remember some text which occurs in the row, you can use the Find\ncommand (keyboard shortcut command-F).  This will open a dialog which\nwill ask you for some text to search for, and where to look for that\ntext in each row.  By default, it will find the first matching line in\nthe whole table, but there are options for other search patterns such as\nstarting from the currently selected line and finding the next match.\nOnce you have already done a search, you can use the\ncommand-G (search again forwards) and command-D (search again backwards)\ncommands to move around to other matching lines.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>How can I move my data to or from another program?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\nThe easiest way to exchange data with another program\nis by copy and paste.  Tabulizer's copy and paste operations\ncan handle data in a Mac-standard tab-separated value format; we expect\nthis to work with other spreadsheet programs, but have not yet tested this.\nIn addition, tabulizer can also copy its tables into plain text strings\n(suitable for pasting into text editors such as BBEdit), and\nHTML-formatted tables (suitable for pasting into TextEdit; note,\nhowever, that TextEdit lacks the ability to edit or format such tables\nonce they are pasted).\nTabulizer's data files are in standard XML format,\nwhich can be read by many browsers and XML editors, but can not\nlikely be read by spreadsheets or text editors.\nWe intend to add options to tabulizer's routines for reading\nand saving files, to handle standard spreadsheet formats such as\ncsv or tsv, but this is not possible yet.\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>I made a mistake. How can I fix it?</h2>\n\n<blockquote>All operations that change the table can be undone by\nthe Undo command (cmd-Z). Continued use of Undo will back up\nthrough the history of operations until the most recent file open\nor new table command. To perform an undone operation again, use\nRedo (cmd-shift-Z). You can also use the Revert command to return\nto the most recently saved version of the file.</blockquote>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n<small><a href=\"/~eppstein/tabulizer/\">Tabulizer</a>,\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>, ICS, UC Irvine</small>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
