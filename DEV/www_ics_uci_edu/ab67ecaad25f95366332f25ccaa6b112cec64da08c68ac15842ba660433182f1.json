If the credential includes identifying information\nabout\nthe individual, the organization controlling the resource can collect\ninformation about his actions.  In the digital world in particular,\nthis\ncollection requires very little effort.  The compiled information can\nthen\nbe shared with or even sold to another organization, without the\nindividual's knowledge or consent.\n\n<p>\nTo protect an individual's privacy in the digital world,\ncryptographers\nhave suggested anonymous credentials, which allow an individual to\nprove\nthat he possesses a particular right without revealing his identity.\nHowever, anonymous credentials based on cryptography alone are\ninherently\ntransferable -- an individual can simply give a copy of his\ncryptographic\nkey to a friend.  In applications where non-transferability is\nimportant,\nbiometric data, such as a fingerprint or retina scan, can be used to\nlink\na credential with a particular individual, but often at the cost of\nanonymity.  For example, if the individual's fingerprint is included\nas\npart of his credential, the organization controlling a resource may\nidentify him when he requests access.\n\n<p>\nPerhaps surprisingly, it is possible to design non-transferable\ncredentials which retain anonymity.  In this talk, we describe a\nmodel and\nprotocol for secure digital credentials which have both of these\nproperties.  Our model uses tamper-resistant hardware to combine\ncryptographic techniques with biometric-based credentials.\nSpecifically,\na user can prove that he is in fact an individual to whom a\ncredential was\nissued, without revealing any additional information.  Furthermore,\ntwo\ninstances of credential displays by the same individual are\nunlinkable.\nAdditionally, we will describe a mechanism which allows such\ncredentials\nto be revoked by the issuing party, and discuss potential extensions\nto\nthe system.\n\n<p>\nThis talk describes joint work with Russell Impagliazzo (UCSD) which\nappeared in the 2003 ACM Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic\nSociety.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
