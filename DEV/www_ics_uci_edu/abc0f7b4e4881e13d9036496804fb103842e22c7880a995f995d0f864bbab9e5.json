Bowker <p>\nSusan Leigh Star <p>\nGraduate School of Library and Information Science <p>\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign <p>\n<p>\nNovember 18, 1996<p>\n<p>\n<i>to appear in a special issue of Philosophia</i><p>\n<p>\n<i>INTRODUCTION</i> \t<p>\n<p>\n\"<i>A classified and hierarchically ordered set of pluralities, of variants,\nhas none of the sting of the miscellaneous and uncoordinated plurals of our\nactual world</i>.\" (Dewey, 1989:  49)<p>\n\t<p>\n\t\"We do many things today that a few hundred years ago would have looked like\nmagic\".  We all know versions of this banal assertion - we've probably all made\nit ourselves at some point or another.  And if we don't understand a given\ntechnology it looks like magic: we are perpetually surprised by the mellifluous\ntones read off our favorite CDs by (we believe) a laser. Star (1995b) notes\nthat even engineers black box and think of technology `as if by magic' in their\neveryday practical dealings with machines.  A common description of a good\nwaiter or butler (one thinks of Jeeves in the Wodehouse stories) is that she\nclears a table `as if by magic'.   Are these two kinds of magic or one or\nnone?<p>\n<p>\n\tThe following paper is an attempt to answer this question, which can be posed\nmore prosaically as: \t \t<p>\n*\tWhat work do classifications and standards do?  We want to look at what goes\ninto making things work like magic: making them fit together so that we can buy\na radio built by someone we  have never met in Japan, plug it into a wall in\nChampaign and hear the world news from the BBC.   \t<p>\n*\tWho does that work?  We want to explore the fact that all this magic involves\nmuch work: there is a lot of hard labor in effortless ease<a\nhref=\"actnet_fn.html#fn0\">[1]</a>.   Such invisible work is often not only\nunderpaid - it is severely underrepresented in theoretical literature (Star and\nStrauss, in press). We will discuss where all the `missing work' that makes\nthings look magical goes.  \t<p>\n*\tWhat happens to the cases that don't fit?  We want to draw attention to cases\nthat don't fit easily into our created world of standards and classifications:\nthe left handers in the world of right-handed magic, chronic disease sufferers\nin the world of allopathic acute medicine, the onion-hater in MacDonalds (Star,\n1991b) and so forth. <p>\n<p>\n\tThese are issues of great epistemological, political and ethical import.  It\nis easy to get lost in Baudrillard's (1990) cool memories of simulacra.  The\nhype of our times is that we don't need to think about the work any more: the\nreal issues are scientific and technological - in artificial life, thinking\nmachines, nanotechnology, genetic manipulation... Clearly each of these\n<i>are</i> important.  However, we endeavor to demonstrate that there is rather\nmore at stake - epistemologically, politically and ethically - in the day to\nday work of building classification system and producing and maintaining\nstandards than in these philosophical high-fliers.   The pyrotechnics may hold\nour fascinated gaze; they cannot provide any path to answering our questions.\n<p>\n\tThrough looking at classification systems and standards, we will move towards\nan understanding of the stuff which makes up the networks of actor network\ntheory. Latour, Callon and others within the actor-network approach have\ndeveloped an array of concepts in order to describe the development and\noperation of technoscience.  Their valuable concepts include:  regimes of\ndelegation; the centrality of mediation; and the position that nature and\nsociety are not causes but consequences of human scientific and technical work.\nThe position that a fact may be seen as a consequence, and not as an\nantecedent, is axiomatic to the American pragmatist approach as well,\nparticularly in the work of John Dewey (e.g., Dewey, 1929).    As he noted in\nhis <i>Experience and Nature: </i><p>\n<i></i><p>\nFor things are objects to be treated, used, acted upon and with, enjoyed and\nendured, even more than things to be known.  They are things HAD before they\nare things cognized....the isolation of traits characteristic of objects known,\nand then defined as the sole ultimate realities, accounts for the denial to\nnature of the characters which make things lovable and contemptible, beautiful\nand ugly, adorable and awful.  It accounts for the belief that nature is an\nindifferent, dead mechanism; it explains why characteristics that are the\nvaluable and valued traits of objects in actual experience are thought to\ncreative a fundamentally troublesome philosophical problem. (1989 [1925]:  p.\n21)<p>\n<i></i><p>\n<i></i>We draw attention here to the places where the work gets done of\nassuring that delegation and mediation will work: to the places where human and\nnon-human are constructed to be operationally and analytically equivalent.  And\nfollowing both Dewey and Latour, we also question the indifference -- of\nnature, and of machines.  So doing, we explore the political and ethical\ndimensions of actor-network theory, restoring the interlinked and webbed\nrelationships between people, things, and infrastructure. <p>\n<p>\n<i>TWO DEFINITIONS</i> \t<p>\n\tWe will take a `classification' to be a spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal\nsegmentation of the world.  A `classification system' is a set of boxes,\nmetaphorical or not, into which things can be put in order to then do some kind\nof work - bureaucratic or knowledge production.  We will not demand of a\nclassification system that it has properties such as: <p>\n*\tthe operation of consistent classificatory principles (for example being\nsolely a <i>genetic</i> classification (Tort, 1989) classifying things by their\norigin); <p>\n*\tmutual exclusivity of categories; <p>\n*\tcompleteness (total coverage of the world being described). <p>\nNo working classification system that we have looked at meets these `simple'\nrequirements and we doubt that any ever could (Desrosi&egrave;res and Thevenot,\n1988).   <p>\n\tFor example, consider the International Classification of Diseases, which will\nbe one of our major examples throughout this paper.  The full title of the\ncurrent (10th) edition of the ICD, is: \"ICD-10 - International Statistical\nClassification of Diseases and Related Health Problems; Tenth Revision\".   Note\nthat it is designated a `statistical' classification. By this is meant that\nonly diseases which are statistically significant are to be entered in (it is\nnot an attempt to classify all disease).  It calls itself a `classification',\neven though many have said that it is a `nomenclature' since it has no single\nclassificatory principle (it has at least four; which are not mutually\nexclusive (Bowker and Star, 1994).  In many cases it represents a compromise\nbetween conflicting schemes:  \"The terms used in categories C82-C85 for\nnon-Hodgkin's lymphomas are those of the Working Formulation, which attempted\nto find common ground among several major classification systems.  The terms\nused in these schemes are not given in the Tabular List but appear in the\nAlphabetical Index; exact equivalence with the terms appearing in the Tabular\nList is not always possible\". (ICD-10, 1, 215).  However, it presents itself\nclearly as a classification scheme and not a nomenclature.  Since 1970, there\nhas been an effort underway by the World Health Organization to build a\ndistinct International Nomenclature of Diseases, whose main purpose will be to\nprovide: \"a single recommended name for every disease entity\" (ICD-10, 1, 25).\nThe point here is that we want to take a broad enough definition so that\nanything that is consistently called a classification system can be included.\nIf we took a purist view, the ICD would be a nomenclature and who knows what\nthe IND would be.  With a broad definition we can look at the work that is\ninvolved in building and maintaining a family of entities that people call\nclassification systems - rather than attempt the Herculean, Sisyphian task of\npurifying the (un)stable systems in place.  Howard Becker makes the point here:\n\"Epistemology has been a ... negative discipline, mostly devoted to saying what\nyou shouldn't do if you want your activity to merit the title of science, and\nto keeping unworthy pretenders from successfully appropriating it.  The\nsociology of science, the empirical descendant of epistemology, gives up trying\nto decide what should and shouldn't count as science, and tells what people who\nclaim to be doing science do...\" (1996: 54-55). <p>\n\tWe will take a `standard' to be any set of agreed-upon rules for the\nproduction of (textual or material) objects.  There are a number of histories\nof standards which point to the development and maintenance of standards as\nbeing a key to industrial production.  Thus, as David Turnbull points out, it\nwas possible to build a cathedral like Chartres without standard\nrepresentations (blueprints) and standard building materials (regular sizes for\nstones, tools etc.) (1993).  However it is not possible to build a modern\nhousing development without them: too much needs to come together -\nelectricity, gas, sewer, timber sizes, screws, nails and so on.  The control of\nstandards is a central, often underanalyzed (but see the work of Paul David -\nfor example David and Rothwell, 1994 - for a rich treatment) feature of\neconomic life.  They are key to knowledge production as well - Latour (1987)\nspeculates that far more economic resources are spent creating and maintaining\nstandards than in producing `pure' science.  Key dimensions of standards are:\n<p>\n*\tThey are often deployed in the context of making things work together -\ncomputer protocols for Internet communication involve a cascade of standards\n(cf. Abbate and Kahin, 1995) which need to work together well in order for the\naverage user to gain seamless access to the web of information.  There are\nstandards for the components to link from your computer to the phone network,\nfor coding and decoding binary streams as sound, for sending messages from one\nnetwork to another, for attaching documents to messages and so forth; \t<p>\n*\tThey are often enforced by legal bodies - be these professional\norganizations; manufacturers' organizations or the State. We can say tomorrow\nthat volap&uuml;k (a universal language that boasted some 23 journals in 1889<a\nhref=\"actnet_fn.html#fn1\">[2]</a>) or its successor Esperanto shall henceforth\nbe the standard language for international diplomacy; without a mechanism of\nenforcement we shall probably fail.   \t<p>\n*\tThere is no natural law that the best (technically superior) standard shall\nwin - the QWERTY keyboard, Lotus 123, DOS and VHS are often cited in this\ncontext.  Standards have significant inertia, and can be very difficult to\nchange. <p>\n<p>\n\t\tClassifications and standards are two sides of the same coin.  The\ndistinction between them (as we are defining them) is that classifications are\ncontainers for the descriptions of events - they are an aspect of\norganizational, social and personal memory - whereas standards are procedures\nfor how to do things - they are an aspect of acting in the world.  Every\nsuccessful standard imposes a classification system.<p>\n<p>\n<i>UNDERSTANDING CLASSIFYING AND STANDARDIZING</i> \t<p>\n\tThis  paper will offer four major themes for understanding classifying,\nstandardizing (and the related processes of formalizing) and their politics and\nhistories.  Each theme operates as a gestalt switch - it comes in the form of\nan infrastructural inversion (Bowker, 1994).  Inverting our commonsense notion\nof infrastructure means taking what have often been seen as behind the scenes,\nboring, background processes to the real work of politics and knowledge\nproduction<a href=\"actnet_fn.html#fn1\">[3]</a> and bringing their contribution\nto the foreground.   The first two, ubiquity and material texture,  speak to\nthe <i>space </i> of actor-networks; the second two, the indeterminate past and\nthe practical politics, speak to their <i>time</i>.  Taken together, they\nsketch out features of the historically creation of the infrastructure which\n(ever partially, ever incompletely) orders the world in such a way that\nactor-network theory becomes a reasonable description. <p>\n<p>\n\tThe first major theme is seeing the <b>ubiquity</b> of classifying and\nstandardizing. Classification schemes and standards literally saturate the\nworlds we live in.  This saturation is furthermore intertwined, or webbed\ntogether.  While it is possible to pull out a single classification scheme or\nstandard for reference purposes, in reality none of them stand alone.  So a\nsubproperty of ubiquity is interdependence, if not smooth integration.   <p>\n<p>\n\tThe second major theme is to see classifications and standards as\n<b>materially textured.</b>  Under the sway of cognitivism, it is easy to see\nclassifications as properties of mind and standards as ideal numbers or\nsettings.  But both have material force in the world, and are built into and\nembedded in every feature of the built environment (and many of the\nborderlands, such as with engineered genetic organisms).  When we think of\nclassifications and standards as material, we can afford ourselves of what we\nknow about material structures, such as structural integrity, enclosures and\nconfinements, permeability, and durability, among many others.  We see people\ndoing this all the time in describing organizational settings, and a common way\nto hear people's experience of this materiality is through metaphors.  So the\ngeneration of metaphors is closely linked with the shift to texture. <p>\n<p>\n\tThe third major theme is to see <b>the past as indeterminate</b><a\nhref=\"actnet_fn.html#fn1\">[4]</a>. This is not a new idea to historiography,\nbut is important in understanding the evolution of ubiquitous\nclassification/standardization and the multiple voices that are represented in\nany scheme.  No one classification orders reality for everyone -- e.g. the red\nlight-green light-yellow light categories don't work for blind people or those\nwho are red-green color blind. In looking to classification schemes as ways of\nordering the past, it is easy to forget those who are overlooked in this way.\nThus, the indeterminacy of the past implies recovering multi-vocality; it also\nmeans understanding how standard narratives that seem universal have been\nconstructed (Star, 1991a). <p>\n<p>\n\tThe fourth major theme is uncovering <b>the practical politics of classifying\nand standardizing</b>.  There are two aspects of these politics:  arriving at\ncategories and standards, and, in the process, deciding what will be visible\nwithin the system (and of course what will thus then be invisible).  The\nnegotiated nature of standards and classifications follows from indeterminacy\nand multiplicity that whatever appears as universal or, indeed, standard, is\nthe result of negotiations or conflict.  How do these negotiations take place?\nWho determines the final outcome in preparing a formal classification?\nVisibility issues arise as one decides where to make the cuts in the system,\nfor example,  down to what level of detail one specifies a description of work,\nof an illness, of a setting.  Because there are always advantages and\ndisadvantages to being visible, this becomes crucial in the workability of the\nschema. <p>\n<p>\n<b>Ubiquity</b> \t<p>\n\tIn the built world we inhabit, thousands and thousands of standards are used\neverywhere, from setting up the plumbing in a house to assembling a car engine\nto transferring a file from one computer to another.  Consider the canonically\nsimple act of writing a letter longhand, putting it in an envelope and mailing\nit.  There are standards for (inter alia): paper size, the distance that lines\nare apart if it is lined paper, envelope size, the glue on the envelope, the\nsize of stamps, their glue, the ink in the pen that you wrote with, the\nsharpness of its nib, the composition of the paper (which in turn can be broken\ndown to the nature of the watermark, if any; the degree of recycled material\nused in its production, the definition of what counts as recycling).  And so\nforth. <p>\n<p>\n\tSimilarly, in any bureaucracy, classifications abound -- consider the simple\nbut increasingly common classifications that are used when you dial an airline\nfor information now (\"if you are traveling domestically, press 1\"; \"if you want\ninformation about flight arrivals and departures, press 2....\").   And once the\nairline has hold of you, you are classified by them as a frequent flyer\n(normal, gold or platinum); corporate or individual; tourist or business class;\nshort haul or long haul (different fare rates and scheduling applies); irate or\nnot (different hand-offs to the supervisor when you complain). <p>\n\tA systems approach would see the proliferation of both standards and\nclassifications as a matter of integration -- almost like a gigantic web of\ninteroperability.  Yet the sheer density of these phenomena go beyond questions\nof interoperability. They are layered, tangled, textured; they interact to form\nan ecology as well as a flat set of compatibilities. There ARE spaces between\n(unclassified, non-standard areas), of course, and these are equally important\nto the analysis. A question: it seems that increasingly these spaces are marked\nas unclassified and non-standard. How does that change their qualities?  <p>\n\tIt is a struggle to step back from this complexity and think about the issue\nof ubiquity broadly, rather than try to trace the myriad connections in any one\ncase. We need concepts for understanding movements, textures, shifts that will\ngrasp larger patterns in this. For instance, the distribution of residual\ncategories (\"not elsewhere classified\" or \"other\"), is one such concept.\n\"Others\" are everywhere.  The analysis of any one instance of a residual\ncategory might yield information about biases or what is valued in any given\ncircumstance; seeing that residual categories are ubiquitous offers a much more\ngeneral sweep on the categorizing tendencies of most modern cultures.\nAnother class of concepts which are found ubiquitously, and which speak to the\ngeneral pervasiveness of standards and classification schemes, concern those\nwhich describe tangles or mismatches between subsystems.  For instance, what\nStrauss calls a \"cumulative mess trajectory\" is a useful notion  (Strauss, et\nal., 1985).   In medicine, this occurs when one has an illness, is given a\nmedicine to cure the illness, but incurs a serious side effect, which then\nneeds to be treated with another medicine, etc. If the trajectory becomes so\ntangled that you can't return and the interactions multiply, \"cumulative mess\"\nresults. We see this phenomenon in the interaction of categories and standards\nall the time -- ecological examples are particularly rich places to look.  <p>\n<p>\n <b>Texturing Classification and Standardization </b>\t<p>\n\tHow do we \"see\" this densely saturated classified world? We are commonly used\nto casually black-boxing this behind-the-scenes machinery, even to the point,\nas we noted above, of ascribing a casual magic to it.  All classification and\nstandardization schemes are a mixture of physical entities such as paper forms,\nplugs, or software instructions encoded in silicon and conventional\narrangements such as speed and rhythm, dimension, and how specifications are\nimplemented.  Perhaps because of this mixture, the web of intertwined schemes\ncan be difficult to \"see.\" In general, the trick is to question every\napparently natural easiness in the world around us and look for the work\ninvolved in making it easy.  Within a project or on a desktop, the seeing\nconsists in seamlessly moving between the physical and the conventional.  So\nwhen a computer programmer writes some lines of C code, she moves within\nconventional constraints and makes innovations based on them; at the same time,\nshe strikes plastic keys, shifts notes around on a desktop, and consults\nmanuals for various standards and other information. If we were to try to list\nout all the classifications and standards involved in writing a program, the\nlist could run to pages.  Classifications include types of objects, types of\nhardware, matches between requirements categories and code categories, and\nmeta-categories such as the goodness of fit of the piece of code with the\nlarger system under development. Standards range from the precise integration\nof the underlying hardware to the 60Hz power coming out of the wall through a\nstandard size plug.   <p>\n\tMerely reducing the description to the physical aspect such as the plugs does\nnot get us anywhere interesting in terms of the actual mixture of physical and\nconventional.  A good operations researcher could describe how and whether\nthings would work together, often purposefully blurring the\nphysical/conventional boundaries in making the analysis.  But what is missing\nthere is a sense of the landscape of work as experienced by those within it.\nIt gives no sense of something as important as the texture of an organization:\nit is smooth or rough?  Bare or knotty?  What is needed is a sense of the\ntopography of all of the arrangements -- are they colliding?  co-extensive?\ngappy?  orthogonal?  \tOne way to begin to get at these questions is to begin to\ntake quite literally the kinds of metaphors that people use when describing\ntheir experience of organizations, bureaucracies, and information systems\n(Star, in press).    So, for example, when someone says something simple like\n\"things are running smoothly,\" the smoothness is descriptive of an array of\narticulations of people, things, work and standards.  When someone says, \"I\nfeel as though the whole project is moving through thick molasses,\" it points\nto the opposite experience.  These are not merely poetic expressions, although\nat some level they are that, too.  As Schon pointed out in his seminal book,\n<i>Displacement of Concepts, </i>a metaphor is an import, meant to illuminate\naspects of a current situation via juxtaposition (1963).  It is also a rich and\noften unmined source of knowledge about people's experience of the densely\nclassified world. <p>\n<p>\n <b>The Indeterminacy of the Past </b>\t<p>\n\tThere is no way of ever getting access to the past except through\nclassification systems of one sort or another - formal or informal,\nhierarchical or not ... .   Take the unproblematic statement: \"In 1640, the\nEnglish Revolution occurred; this led to a twenty year period in which the\nEnglish had no monarchy\".  The classifications involved here include:  \t<p>\n*\tThe current segmentation of time into days, months and years.  Accounts of\nthe English revolution generally use the Gregorian calendar, which was adopted\nsome hundred years later - so causing translation problems with contemporary\ndocuments; <p>\n*\tThe classification of `peoples' into English, Irish, Scots, French and so on.\nThese designations were by no means so clear at the time - the whole discourse\nof national genius really only arose in the nineteenth century; \t<p>\n<b>*\t</b>The classification of events into revolutions, reforms, revolts,\nrebellions and so forth (cf. Furet, 1978 on thinking the French revolution).\nThere really was no concept of `revolution' at the time; our current conception\nis marked by the historiographical work of Karl Marx. <b>\t</b><p>\n<b></b>*\tAnd then, what do we classify as being a `monarchy'?  There is a\nstrong historiographical tradition which says that Oliver Cromwell was a\nmonarch - he walked, talked and acted like one after all.  Under this view,\nthere is no hiatus at all in this English institution; rather a usurper took\nthe throne. <p>\n<p>\n\tThere are two major schools of thought with respect to using classification\nsystems on the past - one saying that we should only use classifications\navailable to actors at the time (authors in this tradition warn against the\ndangers of anachronism - Hacking (1995) on child abuse is a sophisticated\nversion) and the other that we should use the real classifications that\nprogress in the arts and sciences has uncovered (typically history informed by\ncurrent sociology will take this path - for example Tort's (1989) work on\n`genetic' classification systems, which were not so called at the time, but\nwhich are of vital interest to the Foucaldian problematic).  Whichever we\nchoose, it is clear that we should always understand classification systems\naccording to the work that they are doing -the network within which they are\nembedded. <p>\n<b>\t</b>When we ask historical questions about the deeply and heterogeneously\nstructured space of classification systems and standards, we are dealing with a\n4-dimensional archaeology - some of the structures it  uncovers are stable,\nsome in motion; some evolving, some decaying. An institutional memory, about\nsay, an epidemic, can be held simultaneously and with internal contradictions\n(sometimes piecemeal or distributed and sometimes with entirely different\nstories at different locations) across [a given institutional] space.  <p>\n\tIn the case of AIDS, for example, there are shifting classifications over the\nlast 20 years, including the invention of the category in the first place.\nThere is then a backwards look at cases which might have been AIDS before we\nhad the category (a problematic gaze to be sure, as Bruno Latour (forthcoming)\nhas written about tuberculosis; see also Star and Bowker, 1997). There are the\nstories about collecting information about a shameful disease, and a wealth of\npersonal narratives about living with it. There is a public health story and a\nvirology story, which use different category systems. There are the\nstandardized forms of insurance companies and the categories and standards of\nthe census bureau; when an attempt was made to combine them in the 80s to\ndisenfranchise young men living in San Francisco from getting health insurance,\nthe resultant political challenge stopped the combination of this data from\nbeing so used. At the same time, the blood banks refused for years to employ\nHIV screening, thus refusing the admission of another category to their blood\nlabeling -- as Shilts (1987) tells us, with many casualties as a result.  <p>\n<p>\n<b>Practical Politics</b> \t<p>\n\tSomeone, somewhere, often a body of people in the proverbial gray suits and\nsmoke-filled rooms, must decide and argue over the minutiae of classifying and\nstandardizing.  The negotiations themselves form the basis for a fascinating\npractical ontology -- our favorite example is when is someone really alive?  Is\nit breathing, attempts at breathing, movement....?  And how long must each of\nthose last?  Whose voice will determine the outcome is sometimes an exercise of\npure power:  we, the holders of Western medicine and of colonialism, will\ndecide what a disease is, and simply obviate systems such as acupuncture or\nAyruvedic medicine.  Sometimes the negotiations are more subtle, involving\nquestions such as the disparate viewpoints of an immunologist and a surgeon, or\na public health official (interested in even ONE case of the plague) and a\nstatistician (for whom one case is not relevant) (Neumann and Star, 1996).\n<p>\n\tOnce a system is in place, the practical politics of these decisions are often\nforgotten, literally buried in archives (when records are kept at all) or built\ninto software or the sizes and compositions of things.  In addition to our\narchaeological expeditions into the records of such negotiations, we provide\nhere some observations of the negotiations in action. \tFinally, even where\neveryone agrees on the way the classifications or standards should be\nestablished, there are often practical difficulties about how to craft their\narchitecture.  For example, a classification system with 20,000 \"bins\" on every\nform is practically unusable.  (The original International Classification of\nDiseases had some 200 diseases not because of the nature of the human body and\nits problems but because this was the maximum number that would fit the large\ncensus sheets then in use).  Sometimes the decision about how fine-grained to\nmake the system has political consequences as well.  For instance, in\ndescribing and recording the tasks someone does, as in the case of nursing\nwork, may mean controlling or surveilling their work as well, and may imply an\nattempt to take away discretion.  After all, the loosest classification of work\nis accorded to those with the most power and discretion, who are able to set\ntheir own terms.  <p>\n<b>\t</b>These ubiquitous, textured classifications and standards help frame our\nrepresentation of the past and the sequencing of events in the present.  They\ncan best be understood as doing the ever-local, ever-partial work of making it\nappear that science describes nature (and nature alone) and that politics is\nabout social power (and social power alone). Consider the case discussed at\nlength by Young (1995) and Kirk and Kutchins (1992) of psychoanalysts who in\norder to receive reimbursement for this procedures need to couch them in a\nbiomedical language (the DSM) that is anathema to them, but is the lingua\nfranca of the medical insurance companies.  There are local translation\nmechanisms that allow the DSM to continue to operate and to provide the sole\nlegal, recognized representation of mental disorder.  A `reverse engineering'\nof the DSM or the ICD reveals the multitude of local political and social\nstruggles and compromises which go into the constitution of a `universal'\nclassification. <p>\n<p>\n<i>INFRASTRUCTURE AND ACTOR NETWORK THEORY </i>\t<p>\n<p>\n\tWe have, then, looked briefly at the space and time of the infrastructures\nthat subtend actor-networks.  Our position is that through due attention to\nthese infrastructures, we can achieve an understanding of how it is that actor\nnetwork theory comes to be a useful way of describing the nature scientific\nknowledge on the one hand and the (increasing) convergence of human and\nnon-human on the other. <p>\n\tThe converging sameness of humans and non-humans, and in general the\nconstruction of a world in which actor-network theory is true, is a political\nand ethical question.  Work by  scholars such as Joan Fujimura (1991), Valerie\nSingleton and Mike Michael (1993)  and Leigh Star  (1991b; 1995) has pointed to\nthe fact that actor-network theory can be read as an uncritical\n<i>celebration</i> of the power of modern science  and technology.  There are\ncertainly readings of Latour's <u>Science in Action</u> or <u>The\nPasteurization of France</u> which could support such an assertion.  Through\nour concentration on the work of standardization and classification - a\nconcentration fully consonant with the analysis of Latour and Callon - we are\npointing to a place where actor-network theory can be further developed; and to\na place where its political side meets its philosophical underpinnings. <p>\n\tIn order to clarify our position here, let us take an analogy.  In the early\nnineteenth century in England there were a huge number of capital crimes -\nstarting from stealing a loaf of bread and going up... .   However, precisely\nbecause the penalties were so draconian, few juries would ever impose the\nmaximum sentence; and indeed there was actually a drastic reduction in the\nnumber of executions even as the penal code was progressively strengthened.\nThere are two ways of writing this history - one can either concentrate on the\ncreation of the law; or one can concentrate on the way things worked out in\npractice.  This is very similar to the position taken in Latour's<i> We have\nnever been modern</i>: where he says we can either look at what scientists say\nthat they are doing (working within a purified realm of knowledge) or at what\nthey actually are doing (manufacturing hybrids).  Actor network theory has\nlooked in detail at the role of relatively black-boxed hybrids in creating the\ndiscourse of pure science as endpoint; we are advocating a development of the\ntheory that pays more attention to the classification and standardization work\nthat allows for hybrids to be manufactured and so explores the terrain of the\npolitics of science in action. <p>\n\tThe point for us is that both of these are valid kinds of account.  Early\nactor-network theory concentrated on the ways in which it comes to seem that\nscience gives an objective account of natural order: trials of strength,\nenrolling of allies, cascades of inscriptions and the operation of immutable\nmobiles.  It drew attention to the importance of the development of standards\n(though not to the linked development of classification systems); but did not\nlook at these in detail.  We were invited to look at the process of producing\nsomething which looked like what the positivists alleged science to be.  We got\nto see the `Janus face' of science.  In so doing we `followed the actors'.  We\nshared their insights (allies must be enrolled, translation mechanisms must be\nset in train so that, in the canonical case, Pasteur's laboratory work can be\nseen as a direct translation of the quest for French honor after defeat in the\nbattlefield).   <p>\n\tHowever, by the very nature of the method, we also shared their blindness.\nThe actors being followed did not <i>see</i> what was excluded: they\nconstructed a world in which that exclusion could occur.  Thus if we just\nfollow the doctors who create the International Classification of Diseases at\nthe World Health Organization in Geneva, we will not see the variety of\nrepresentation systems that other cultures have for classifying diseases of the\nbody and spirit; and we will not see the fragile networks these classification\nsystems subtend.  Rather, we will see only those actants who are strong enough,\nand shaped in the right way, to impact the fragile actor-networks of allopathic\nmedicine.  We will see the blind leading the blind.    <p>\n\tWe ascribe to Latour's (1987) definition of reality as `that which resists'\n(again, a concept with strong American pragmatist resonances, se e.g. Dewey,\n1916). The actor-network will be changed by the resistances that it encounters.\nWe have suggested that the work of dealing with resistance is twofold: \t<p>\n*\tChanging the world such that the actor-network's description of reality\nbecomes true.  Thus if all diseases (of the mind and body) are classified\npurely physiologically and systems of medical observation and treatment are set\nup such the physical manifestations are the only manifestations recorded and\nphysical treatments are the only treatments available then it is of course\npossible that the world will be such that schizophrenia, say, results purely\nand simply from a chemical imbalance in the brain.  It will be impossible to\nthink or act otherwise.  We have called this the principle of <i>convergence\n</i>(Star and Bowker, 1994; Neumann, Bowker and Star, in press). \t<p>\n*\tDistributing the resistance in such a way that it becomes marginalized and\ncan be overlooked.  <p>\n<p>\n\tA good example of responses to resistances comes from the nursing\nadministrators we are studying at present.  We will see how they are producing\na classification of nursing work whose political edge is in the technical work\nof meshing this classification system with those already operating within the\nsociotechnical framework of the hospital.  There is a play of resistances\naround this political of representation.<p>\n\tThe Iowa Intervention Team are producing a classification of all nursing work\n- a nursing interventions classification (NIC) (McCloskey and Bulechek, 1996).\nNIC itself is a fascinating system. Those of us studying it see it as an\nethnomethodological nirvana. Some categories, like <i>bleeding reduction -\nnasal</i>, are on the surface relatively obvious and codable into discrete\nunits of work practice to be carried out on specific occasions. But what about\nthe equally important categories of hope installation and humor?   Hope\ninstallation includes the subcategory of `Avoid masking the truth'. This is not\nso much something that nurses do on a regular basis, as something that they\nshould not do constantly. It also includes: `Help the patient expand spiritual\nself'. Here the contribution that the nurse is making is to an implicit\nlifelong program of spiritual development. With respect to humor, the very\ndefinition of the category suggests the operation of a paradigm shift:\n\"Facilitating the patient to perceive, appreciate, and express what is funny,\namusing, or ludicrous in order to establish relationships\"; and it is unclear\nhow this could ever be attached to a time line: it is something the nurse\nshould always do while doing other things. Further, contained within the\nnursing classification is an anatomy of what it is to be humorous, and a theory\nof what humor does. The recommended procedures break humor down into\nsubelements. One should determine the types of humor appreciated by the\npatient; determine the patient's typical response to humor (e.g. laughter or\nsmiles); select humorous materials that create moderate arousal for the\nindividual (for example `picture a forbidding authority figure dressed only in\nunderwear'); encourage silliness and playfulness and so on to make a total of\nfifteen sub-activities: any one of which might be scientifically relevant. A\nfeature traditionally attached to the personality of the nurse (being a\ncheerful and supportive person) is now attached through the classification to\nthe job description as an intervention which can be accounted for. <p>\n\tWithin the context of the hospital's sociotechnical system, nursing work has\nbeen deemed irrelevant to any possible future reconstruction; it has been\ncanonically invisible, in Star's (1991a) term. The logic of NIC's advocators is\nthat what has been excluded from the representational space of medical practice\nshould be included.    The Iowa group, the kernel of whom were teachers of\nnursing administration, made essentially three arguments for the creation of a\nnursing classification. First, it was argued that without a standard language\nto describe nursing interventions, there would be no way of producing a\nscientific body of knowledge about nursing. NIC in theory would be articulated\nwith two other classification systems: NOC (the nursing sensitive patient\noutcomes classification scheme) and NANDA (the nursing diagnosis scheme). The\nthree could work together thusly. One could perform studies over a set of\nhospitals employing the three schemes in order to check if a given category of\npatient responded well to a given category of nursing intervention. Rather than\nthis comparative work being done anecdotally as in the past through the\naccumulation of experience, it could be done scientifically through the conduct\nof experiments. The Iowa Intervention project made up a jingle: NANDA, NIC and\nNOC to the tune of Hickory, Dickory, Dock to stress this interrelationship of\nthe three schemes. The second argument for classifying nursing interventions\nwas that it was a key strategy for defending the professional autonomy of\nnursing. The Iowa nurses are very aware of the literature on\nprofessionalization - notably Schon (1983) - and are aware of the force of\nhaving an accepted body of scientific knowledge as their domain. (Indeed Andrew\nAbbott, taking as his central case the professionalization of medicine, makes\nthis one of his key attributes of a profession [1988].) The third argument was\nthat nursing, alongside other medical professions, was moving into the new\nworld of computers. As the representational medium changed, it was important to\nbe able to talk about nursing in a language that computers could understand  -\nelse nursing work would not be represented at all in the future, and would risk\nbeing even further marginalized than it was at present.<p>\n\tHowever, there is also a danger in representing.  It is more difficult to hive\noff aspects of nursing duties and give them to lower paid adjuncts, if nursing\nwork is relatively opaque. The test sites that are implementing NIC have\nprovided some degree of resistance here, arguing that activities should be\nspecified - so that, within a soft decision support model a given diagnosis can\ntrigger a nursing intervention constituted of a single, well-defined set of\nactivities. As Marc Berg (in press) has noted in his study of medical expert\nsystems, such decision support can only work universally if local practices are\nrendered fully standard. A key professional strategy for nursing - particularly\nin the face of the ubiquitous process re-engineer - is realized by deliberate\nnon-representation in the information infrastructure. What is remembered in the\nformal information systems resulting is attuned to professional strategy and to\nthe information requisites of the nurses' take on what nursing science is. <p>\n\tFurther, there is a brick wall that they come up against when dealing with\nnurses on the spot: if they overspecify an intervention (that is break it down\ninto too many constituent parts), then it gets called, in the field, an NSS\nclassification - where NSS stands for `No shit, Sherlock' and is not used\n(Bowker, Star and Timmermans, 1996). It is assumed that any reasonable\neducation in nursing or medicine should lead to a common language wherein\nthings do not need spelling out to the ultimate degree. The information space\nwill be sufficiently well pre-structured that some details can be assumed.\nAttention to the finer-grained details is delegated to the educational system,\nwhere it is overdetermined. <p>\n\tThese NIC-related strategies of dealing with overspecification and the\npolitical drive to relative autonomy by dropping things out of the\nrepresentational space - are essential for the development of a successful\nactor-network system that includes nursing. These two forms of erasure of local\ncontext are needed in order to create the very infrastructure in which nursing\ncan both appear as a science like any other and yet nursing as a profession can\ncontinue to develop as a rich, local practice. The ongoing erasure is\nguaranteed by the classification system: only information about nursing\npractice recognized by NIC can be coded on the forms fed into a hospital's\ncomputers or stored in a file cabinet. <p>\n\tNursing informaticians agree as a body that in order for proper health care to\nbe given and for nurses to be recognized as a profession, hospitals as\norganizations should code for nursing within the framework of their memory\nsystems: nursing work should be classified and forms should be generated which\nutilize these classifications. However, there has been disagreement with\nrespect to strategy.  To understand the difference that has emerged, recall one\nof those forms you have filled in (we have all experienced one) which do not\nallow you to say what you think. You may, in a standard case, have been offered\na choice of several racial origins; but may not believe in any such\ncategorization. There is no room on the form to write an essay on race identity\npolitics. So you either you make an uncomfortable choice in order to get\ncounted, and hope that enough of your complexity will be preserved by your set\nof answers to the form; or you don't answer the question and perhaps decide to\ndevote some time to lobbying the producers of the offending form to reconsider\ntheir categorization of people. The NIC group has wrestled with the same\nstrategic choice: fitting their classification system into the Procrustean bed\nof all the other classification systems that they have to articulate with in\nany given medical setting in order to form part a given organization's\npotential memory; or rejecting the ways in which memory is structured in the\norganizations that they are dealing with. We will now look in turn at each of\nthese strategies. <p>\n\tLet us look first at the argument for including NIC within the information\ninfrastructural framework of the hospital's sociotechnical system. They argue\nthat NIC has to respond to multiple important agendas simultaneously. Consider\nthe following description of needs for a standard vocabulary of nursing\npractice: <p>\nIt is essential to develop a standardized nomenclature of nursing diagnoses in\norder to name without ambiguity those conditions in clients that nurses\nidentify and treat without prescription from other disciplines; such\nidentification is not possible without agreement as to the meaning of terms.\nProfessional standards review boards require discipline-specific\naccountability; some urgency in developing a discipline-specific nomenclature\nis provided by the impending National Health Insurance legislation, since\ndemands for accountability are likely both to increase and become more\nstringent following passage of the legislation. Adoption of a standardized\nnomenclature of nursing diagnoses may also alleviate problems in communication\nbetween nurses and members of other disciplines, and improvement in\ninterdisciplinary communication can only lead to improvement in patient care.\nStandardization of the nomenclature of nursing diagnoses will promote health\ncare delivery by identifying, for legal and reimbursement purposes, the\nevaluation of the quality of care provided by nurses; facilitate the\ndevelopment of a taxonomy of nursing diagnoses; provide the element for storage\nand retrieval of nursing data; and facilitate the teaching of nursing by\nproviding content areas that are discrete, inclusive, logical, and consistent .\n(Castles, 1981, 38) <p>\nWe have cited this passage at length since it unites most of the motivations\nfor the development of NIC. The development of a new information infrastructure\nfor nursing, heralded in this passage, will make nursing more `memorable'. It\nwill also lead to a clearance of past nursing knowledge - henceforth\nprescientific - from the textbooks; it will lead to changes in the practice of\nnursing (a redefinition of disciplinary boundaries) - a shaping of nursing so\nthat future practice converges on its representation. <p>\n\tMany nurses and nursing informaticians are concerned that the profession\nitself may have to change too much in order to meet the requirements of the\ninformation infrastructure. We murder, they note, to dissect. In her study of\nnursing information systems in France, Ina Wagner (1993) speaks as follows of\nthe gamble of computerizing nursing records: <p>\nNurses might gain greater recognition for their work and more control over the\ndefinition of patients' problems while finding out that their practice is\nincreasingly shaped by the necessity to comply with regulators' and employers'\ndefinitions of 'billable categories.'<p>\nIndeed, a specific feature of this 'thought world' into which nurses are\ngradually socialized through the use of computer systems is the integration of\nmanagement criteria into the practice of nursing.  She continues:  \"Working\nwith a patient classification system with time units associated with each care\nactivity enforces a specific time discipline on nurses. They learn to assess\npatients' needs in terms of working time.\"  This analytic perspective is shared\nby the Iowa nurses. They argue that documentation is centrally important; it\nnot only provides a record of nursing activity but structures same:  <p>\n\tWhile nurses do complain about paperwork, they structure their care so that\nthe required forms get filled out. If the forms reflect a philosophy of the\nnurse as a dependent assistant to the doctor who delivers technical care in a\nfunctional manner, this is to some extent the way the nurse will act. If the\nforms reflect a philosophy of the nurse as a professional member of the health\nteam with a unique independent function, the nurse will act accordingly. In the\nfuture, with the implementation of price-per-case reimbursement\nvis-&agrave;-vis diagnosis related groups, documentation will become more\nimportant than ever. (Bulechek and McCloskey, 1985, 406). <p>\n\tAs the NIC classification has developed, observes Joanne McCloskey, the\ntraditional category of `nursing process' has been replaced by `clinical\ndecision making plus knowledge classification'. And in a representation of NIC\nthat she produced both the patient and the nurse had dropped entirely out of\nthe picture (both were, she said, located within the `clinical decision making\nbox' on her diagram) (Iowa Intervention Project meeting, 6/8/95). A recent book\nabout the next generation nursing information system argued that the new\nsystem: <p>\nCannot be assembled like a patchwork quilt, by piecing together components of\nexisting technologies and software programs. Instead, the system must be\nrebuilt on a design different from that of most approaches used today: it must\nbe a data-driven rather than a process-driven system. A dominant feature of the\nnew system is its focus on the acquisition, management, processing, and\npresentation of 'atomic-level' data that can be used across multiple settings\nfor multiple purposes. The paradigm shift to a data-driven system represents a\nnew generation of information technology; it provides strategic resources for\nclinical nursing practice, rather than just support for various nursing tasks.\n(Zielstorff et al., 1993, 1). <p>\nThis speaks to the progressive denial of process and continuity through the\nsegmentation of nursing practice into activity units. Many argue that in order\nto `speak with' databases at a national and international level just such\nsegmentation is needed. The fear is that unless nurses can describe their\nprocess this way (at the risk of losing the essence of that process in the\ndescription), then it will not be described at all. They can only have there\nown actions remembered at the price of having others forget, and possibly\nforgetting themselves, precisely what it is that they do. <p>\n\tSome nursing informaticians have chosen instead to challenge the informational\nframework existing in the medical organizations they deal with. They have\nadopted a Batesonian strategy of responding to the threat of the new\ninformation infrastructure by moving the whole argument up one level of\ngenerality and trying to supplant `data-driven' categories with categories that\nrecognize process on their own terms. Thus the Iowa team pointed to the fact\nthat women physicians often spend longer with patients than male doctors, but\nthey need to see patients less often as a result: they argue that just such a\nprocess-sensitive definition of productivity needs to argued for and\nimplemented in medical information systems in order that nursing work gets\nfairly represented (Iowa Intervention Project meeting, 6/8/95). They draw from\ntheir secret (because unrepresented) reservoir of knowledge about process in\norder to challenge the data-driven models from within.  <p>\n\tWithin this strategy, the choice of allies is by no means obvious. Since with\nthe development of NIC we are dealing with the creation of an information\ninfrastructure, the whole question of how and what to challenge becomes very\ndifficult. Scientists can only, willy nilly, deal with data as presented to\nthem by their information base, just as historians of previous centuries must,\nalas, rely on written traces. When creating a new information infrastructure\nfor an old activity, questions have a habit of running away from one: a\ntechnical issue about how to code process can become a challenge to\norganizational theory (and its database). A defense of process can become an\nattack on the scientific world view. One of the chief attacks on the NIC scheme\nhas been made by a nursing informatician, Susan Grobe, who believes that rather\nthan standardize nursing language computer scientists should develop natural\nlanguage processing tools so that nurse narratives can be interpreted. Grobe\nargues for the abandonment of any goal of producing: \"A single coherent account\nof the pattern of action and beliefs in science\" (1992, 92); she goes on to say\nthat: \"philosophers of science have long acknowledged the value of a\nmultiplicity of scientific views\" (92). She excoriates Bulechek and McCloskey,\narchitects of NIC, for having produced work: \"derived from the natural science\nview with its hierarchical structures and mutually exclusive and distinct\ncategories.\" (93). She on the other hand is drawing from cognitive science,\nlibrary science and social science (94). Or again, a recent paper on conceptual\nconsiderations, decision criteria and guidelines for the Nursing Minimum Data\nSet cited Fritjof Capra against reductionism, Steven Jay Gould on the social\nembeddedness of scientific truth and praised Foucault for having developed a\nphilosophical system to \"grapple with this reality\" (Kritek, 1988, 24). Nurse\nscientists, it is argued, \"have become quite reductionistic and mechanistic in\ntheir approach to knowledge generation, at a time when numerous others,\nparticularly physicists, are reversing that pattern\" (p. 27). And nursing has\nto find allies amongst these physicists: <p>\nNurses who deliver care engage in a process. It is actually the cyclic,\ncontinuous repetition of a complex process. It is difficult, therefore, to\nsketch the boundaries of a discrete nursing event, a unit of service, and,\ntherefore, a unit of analysis. Time is clearly a central force in nursing care\nand nursing outcomes. Nurses have only begun to struggle with this factor. It\nhas a centrality that eludes explication when placed in the context of quantum\nphysics. (Kritek, 1988: 28) <p>\nThe point here is not whether this argument is right or wrong. It is an\ninteresting position. It can only be maintained, as can many of the other\npossible links that bristle through the NIC literature, because the information\ninfrastructure itself is in flux. When the infrastructure is not in place to\nprovide a `natural' hierarchy of levels, then discourses can and do make\nstrange connections between themselves.  <p>\n\tIf they want to prove a case within a given hospital for the opening-up of a\nnew nursing position, they need to demonstrate  that nursing is cost-effective\naccording to the dominant accountancy paradigm.  Now they in fact disagree with\nthis paradigm (arguing, for example, that `quality of care' is not quantifiable\nbut is still significant); and yet they feel that they must act <i>as if</i>\nthey accept it - or else their voice will not be heard at all.  There are a\ngroup of radical accountants who argue for the kinds of position that the NIC\nnurses are taking; however, these accountants are tied in to a different series\nof local battles about classification and standardization.  The resistance to\nsuch cost accounting might be large in the aggregate while its impact, because\nof effective distribution, is minimal.<p>\n\tIn order to not be continually erased from the record, nursing informaticians\nare risking either modifying their own practice (making it more data driven) or\nwaging a Quixotic war on database designers. The corresponding gain is great,\nhowever. If the infrastructure itself is designed in such a way that nursing\ninformation has to be present as an independent, well defined category, then\nnursing itself as a profession will have a much better chance of surviving\nthrough rounds of process re-engineering and nursing science as a discipline\nwill have a firm foundation. The infrastructure assumes the position of Bishop\nBerkeley's God: as long as it pays attention to nurses, they will continue to\nexist. Having ensured that all nursing acts are potentially remembered by any\nmedical organization, the NIC team will have gone a long way to ensuring the\nfuture of nursing. <p>\n \tWhat actor-network theory has to offer in its approach to resistance is a\nreading of where and how political work is done in the world of technoscience;\nand how such work can be problematized and challenged.    Donald MacKenzie's\nwonderful study of `missile accuracy' furnishes the best example of this\napproach.  In a concluding chapter to his book, he discusses the possibility of\n`uninventing the bomb', by which he means changing society and technology in\nsuch a way that the atomic bomb becomes an impossibility.  Such change, he\nsuggests, can be carried out in part at the overt level of political\norganizations.  However, and crucially for our purposes, he also sensitizes the\nreader to the site of the development and maintenance of technical standards as\na site of political decisions and struggle.  Standards and classifications,\nhowever dry and formal on the surface are suffused with traces of political and\nsocial work. <p>\n<p>\n<i>CONCLUSION</i><p>\n<i> </i>\tIt is difficult when discussing any theory to adopt the appropriate\ndegree of reflexivity.  Actor-network theory tells us quite clearly that a\ntheory should not be judged according to an absolute set of indicators, but\naccording to the work that it does in the world.  How does the theory itself\nstand up against this criterion?  <p>\n\tWe have argued that it can do a good job in drawing our attention to the real\npolitical work that is being done in the development of technoscience; and can\nprovide us with some useful concepts for analyzing that work.  We have not in\nthis paper argued, but would maintain (in accordance especially with Michel\nSerres' corpus; and to an extent Latour's  <i>We have never been modern</i> and\n<i>Dieux Faitiches</i>) the symmetrical position that there is real\nphilosophical and scientific work being done in the realm traditionally seen as\nthe purely political.  The central point is that technoscientific societies are\npowerful precisely because they are so good at delegating and distributing; and\nthat actor-network theory is well position to track and describe the work of\ndelegation and distribution. <p>\n\tDoes this mean that actor-network theory is <i>the </i>theory for our times?\nIndeed not.  However, it is <i>a </i>theory which takes the work of\nclassification and standardization seriously; and so provides one way of\nunderstanding the development of a master narrative (Western science) which is\nnot a master narrative (because it frequently breaks down locally as\npostmodernists would remind us) and yet which act likes one (in that it enacts\nthe very exclusions and silencing that allow it to appear to be true).   The\nmagic of modern technoscience is a lot of hard work. <p>\n<b>References:</b><p>\n<b></b><p>\nAbbate, J. and Kahin, B.  (eds) (1995). <i>Standards policy for information\ninfrastructure</i>.
