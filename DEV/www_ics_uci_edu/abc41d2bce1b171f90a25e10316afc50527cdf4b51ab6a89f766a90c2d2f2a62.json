For each reading listed (not counting\rthe Baase text), you will write a notebook entry that identifies the article,\rsummarizes it, and gives your reaction to it, as described in more detail\rbelow.  You will collect these entries and submit them periodically for\rreview.  It will help us focus on the content of your notebooks if you follow\rthe formatting requirements at the end of this document, so please read\rthem with care.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>We provide quite a bit of detailed advice\rbelow, but an excellent notebook can consist of entries that are each shorter\rthan half a page.  We&#39;d like you to do some careful reading and serious\rthinking, but you don&#39;t need to do a lot of writing for each notebook\rentry.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Advice on reading and responding:</B> \rAs you read each article, we ask you to look critically at the material\rbeing presented.  This doesn&#39;t mean you need to criticize the article\ror author; it means you need to form your own opinion about it rather than\rjust accepting what the author says.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>First, identify what the author is trying\rto do.  Does the article attempt to persuade, to inform, to teach, or something\relse?  Most of these articles were not written for students of computer\rscience; who <I>is</I> the author&#39;s intended audience?  Then, in your\rreaction, say whether you think the author did a good job; do you think\rthe article has the intended effect on the intended audience?  Below are\rsome common kinds of articles, though the list isn&#39;t exclusive:</FONT></P>\r<UL>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Does the author take a position (pro or con)\ron a particular issue or argument?  If so, identify exactly what the issue\ris, what the author&#39;s position is, and what justification or arguments\rthe author gives for that position.  Then, in your reaction, state your\rown position, say whether you agree or disagree with the author and why,\rand say whether you think anything was left out of the argument.  If you\rcan&#39;t take a stand, explain why not.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Instead of taking a position, does the author\rprovide guidelines or recommendations to manage or improve some situation?\r (Some pro-and-con articles do this, too.)  If so, identify the situation\rand the substance of the author&#39;s recommendations.  Then, in your reaction,\rsay whether you think the recommendations will be effective and why or why\rnot.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Is the article an example of straight reporting\r(i.e., does the author just describe a situation without appearing to take\rsides or make recommendation)?  If so, say whether (and why) you find the\rpresentation understandable, convincing, biased, incomplete, or something\relse.</FONT></LI>\r</UL>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Doing an abbreviated stakeholder analysis--not\rjust identifying the main parties affected but also considering what each\rparty wants and why--may also help you address the kinds of issues and questions\rindicated above.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Article summaries:</B>  When you summarize\ran article, don&#39;t rehash every detail.  Take the time to identify the\rhighlights and the main ideas.  Although the occasional pithy phrase may\rbe worth repeating verbatim, keep the quoting to a minimum and try to restate\rthe key ideas in your own words--this is a way for you to make sure you\rfully understand the issues in the article and any position the author has\rtaken.  A paragraph or two of summary should be plenty, even for the longer\rarticles, so long as you remember that length isn&#39;t equivalent to substance\ror quality.  Thomas Jefferson once said, quoting Blaise Pascal, &quot;I&#39;d\rhave written you a shorter letter, but I didn&#39;t have the time.&quot;\r It takes some time and thought to distill out the essence, but it&#39;s\rprecisely that effort that produces the greatest understanding.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Sometimes a series of articles addresses the\rsame situation.  In those cases, your summaries for the later articles can\rjust identify what&#39;s different about them:  Do they provide more recent\rinformation?  Do they have a different perspective?  You don&#39;t have\rto repeat the similarities.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Article reactions:</B>   Besides answering\rthe questions listed above, your reaction can include what you learned from\rthe article, whether you agreed or disagreed (with the facts stated, with\rthe arguments made, with the author&#39;s core values), how it relates to\ryour own experience (if it does), or whether you found the writing easy\rto follow.  Try to relate the article to the broad theme of the articles\rin the same section of the readings.  Feel free to say that the article\rdidn&#39;t fit well, wasn&#39;t easy to understand, or didn&#39;t teach\ryou anything if that&#39;s your opinion.  These are guidelines and suggestions;\rwe do not expect you to answer every question for every article.  A paragraph\ror two of thoughtful reaction is enough.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Grading:  </B>The notebooks will be graded\ron a check, check-plus, check-minus basis.  A comprehensible minimum response\ras described above should earn a check, which counts about 85%.  To earn\ra check, you need to convince us that you&#39;ve read each article, understood\rit, and thought about it enough to form an opinion about it.  We do expect\ryou to read and react to all the readings on the list; omissions will decrease\ryour score</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>We will not grade the notebooks specifically\rfor English mechanics, but where mechanical problems get in the way of our\runderstanding your entries, your score will be lower.  In your notebook,\ryou may include text from an article in that article&#39;s review without\rquoting it meticulously, but too much copying from the text (rather than\rsummarizing in your own words) diminishes the benefit of doing the notebook\rand may lower your score.  You still must attribute any other outside information\ryou include and of course you can&#39;t use other students&#39; summaries\ror reactions in place of your own.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Format of notebook entries:</B>  It will\rhelp us handle the large volume of notebooks if you take care to follow\rprecisely the formatting requirements below. Each notebook entry must include\rthese parts in this order:</FONT></P>\r<OL TYPE=\"1\">\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A line identifying the article (e.g., &quot;P3:\rDave Wilson, &#39;Marketeers Want to Keep Your Secrets&#39; &quot;), consisting\rof</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<OL TYPE=\"1\">\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The section and sequence number of the article\rin the reading list, abbreviating the section name.  The first article in\rthe voting section would be &quot;V1;&quot; the third article in the privacy\rsection would be &quot;P3.&quot;  The numbers are shown on the reading list;\ryou don&#39;t have to count by hand.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The article&#39;s author and title.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r</OL>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A blank line to separate the identifying line\rfrom the rest of the entry.  (Using bold face for the identifying line would\ralso be fine.)</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A brief summary of the article&#39;s main\rpoints (see above).</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your own reaction to the article, preferably\rin a separate paragraph (see above).</FONT></LI>\r</OL>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Format of entire notebook:</B>  Please\rfollow these overall requirements:</FONT></P>\r<OL TYPE=\"1\">\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You may read the articles in any order, but\ryour notebook must be in the same order as the reading list.  If you did\rskip an article, you should still include its identification line (section/sequence\rnumber, author, title as described above) in your notebook, in order.  (You\rcan do most of this work by copying and pasting from the reading list web\rpage.)</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Leave an inch or two of empty space (blank\rlines) between entries in your notebook. Don&#39;t put each entry on its\rown page.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Produce your notebook in Word or PDF (Acrobat)\rformat.  If your word processor can&#39;t produce either, please let us\rknow and we&#39;ll try to make arrangements.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Put your name and ID on the first page (and\ron all pages if you like).  You don&#39;t need a separate cover page with\rthis information.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Use a 10-point or a 12-point font, single-spaced\rlines, and 1.25-inch margins.</FONT></LI>\r</OL>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>&quot;Why do we have to do these?&quot;:\r </B>We appreciate that writing these notebooks may seem like busywork.\r However, there is much more to them than that. By articulating the summary\rand your reaction to each article, you will understand it and remember it\rbetter than you would if you simply read it and went on.  The notebook also\rgives you a relatively pressure-free way to practice reducing your thoughts\rto written prose, practice everyone can benefit from.  Finally, you may\rbring a paper copy of your notebook (but not the articles themselves) with\ryou to the midterm and final exams; if your summaries and analyses are accurate\rand thorough, they will help you answer the exam questions.  Students often\rask whether they can make changes or additions to the notebooks they turned\rin, and bring the changed version to the exam.  This is fine, although of\rcourse it won&#39;t change the grade you received on the notebook.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Due dates and submission details:</B> \rSince we expect you to keep up with the reading and write your reactions\ras soon as you finish each article, you should be ready to turn in this\relectronic course notebook at any time.
