Goodrich</b> \n</h3>\n</center>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Course Description.</b> \nCovers fundamental concepts in the design and analysis of algorithms and is geared toward practical application and implementation. Topics include greedy algorithms, deterministic and randomized graph algorithms, models of network flow, fundamental algorithmic techniques, and NP-completeness.\n\n<li><b>Coursework.</b> Coursework will consist of weekly homeworks,\ntwo midterms, two programming projects,\nand a comprehensive final exam. The overall grade\nwill be determined 10% from homework, 20% from each midterm, 10% from\neach project, and 30% from the final.\nGroup work on homeworks is permitted, but each\nstudent must list his or her collaborators in writing for each problem.\nIf a student turns in a solution without listing\nthe others who helped produce this solution,\nthis act will be considered cheating (for it is plagarism).\nLate homework assignments will not be accepted,\nbut for the overall total homework score, \nthe lowest homework score will be dropped.\nGroup work on programming projects is not allowed--each program\nmust be individually written.\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Exam policy.</b>\nExam performance must be 100% individual effort; no collaboration\nis allowed on exams.  Any collaboration or copying on exams \nwill be considered cheating.\nIn addition to the procedures of the\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#cheating\">ICS \nCheating Policy</a>, students caught cheating on exams will be given a \nfailing grade in the class.\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Laptop policy.</b>\nLaptops may be brought to class, but should remain <b>closed</b> during lectures\nand exams.\n<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away\">Here's one reason why.</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/business/laptops-not-during-lecture-or-meeting.html?_r=0\">Here is another.</a>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Required Text.</b> The course text, which is required, will be \n<a href=\"https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Algorithm+Design+and+Applications-p-9781118335918\">\nAlgorithm Design and Applications</a>,\nby Goodrich and Tamassia.\nNote: all royalties earned by Dr. Goodrich as a result \nof students in this class purchasing this book will be donated to\nthe charity,\n<a href=\"https://www.fh.org/\">Food for the Hungry</a>.\n<li><b>Recommended Book.</b> A recommended course book is\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Guide-Experimental-Algorithmics-Catherine-McGeoch/dp/0521173019\">A Guide to Experimental Algorithmics</a>, by \nMcGeoch.\n</li>\n\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Week 1:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nGrowth of functions.\nAmortization.  \nBasic Data Structures.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<li><b>Week 2:</b></li>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nSorting, comparison trees, and lower bounds.
