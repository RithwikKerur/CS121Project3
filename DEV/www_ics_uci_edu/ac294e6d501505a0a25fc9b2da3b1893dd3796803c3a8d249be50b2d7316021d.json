Scenario B: the same cards are played as in scenario A\nexcept that the hearts are played during trick 1 and the spades are\nplayed during trick 2.\nThe hand configuration is identical after the partial sequences\ndescribed in scenarios A and B.\nIf, in addition, the same number of tricks are taken by N/S\nduring both of these scenarios then,\neven though the actions of the two scenarios differ,\nthe ultimate set of obtainable results are identical.\n<I>Node isomorphism</I> refers to the situation in which\ntwo nodes correspond to identical hand configurations\nwith equal number of tricks taken by N/S.\n<P>\nConsider the situation after 3 rounds of spades have been played\nwith everybody following suit each time.  Only one spade remains,\nsay in South's hand.  Which spade card remains in South's hand\nis irrelevant to the future trick-taking ability of either side.\nThis is a simple example of\n<I>node equivalence</I>, which refers to the situation in which\ntwo nodes correspond to equivalent hand configurations\nwith equal number of tricks taken by N/S.\n<P>\nNode <I>A</I> is said to be <I>superior</I> to node <I>B</I>\nif nodes <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> correspond to equivalent hand\nconfigurations but N/S have taken a greater number of tricks\nat node <I>A</I> then at node <I>B</I>.\n<P>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\nDan Hirschberg<BR>\nComputer Science Department<BR>\nUniversity of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3425<BR>\n</ADDRESS>\n<tt>dan at ics.uci.edu</tt><br>\nLast modified: July 1, 1996\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
