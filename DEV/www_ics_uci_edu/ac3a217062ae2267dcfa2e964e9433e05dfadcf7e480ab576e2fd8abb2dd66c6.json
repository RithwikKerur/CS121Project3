With\nmy dual background in computer science and economics, I was torn\nbetween graduate school, software development, Wall Street, management\nconsulting, technology marketing, etc... Luckily, I struck an\nideal opportunity to help launch the World Wide Web Consortium\nat MIT which blended aspects of each of these careers. Even before\ngraduating from Caltech, I joined on at MIT to work on Web Security\nstandards and I branched out from there. I have seen the Consortium\ngrow from three people to over thirty at MIT, INRIA in France,\nand Keio University in Japan. My formal role at the consortium\nhas made a part of many W3C projects, and my informal role has\nkept me in touch with the rest, a unique position reflected in\nmy editorship of the <I>Web Journal</I>.\n<P>\nGiven my mix of talents and interests, it's less surprising in\nretrospect that in business, I'm positioned as a technical resource\n(such as my software development ventures and newswriting), while\nin this technical organization my business skills have been more\nleveraged: public speaking, meeting management, coordination with\nmember companies' technical management, working closely with our\nproject managers, helping set the direction of our internal management,\npress relations, and more. I want to become a graduate student\nto focus exclusively on technical and scientific side, since I\nhave the rest of my professional life to develop my business skills.\n<P>\nAt W3C, I have worked closely with almost every staff member,\nso it's hard to pick out just one or two people to prepare a recommendation.\nEven my direct supervisor, Jim Miller, has only overseen a portion\nof my activities here. I've decided, then, to ask Director Tim\nBerners-Lee alone to speak about my record here.\n<H2>Major Projects</H2>\n<P>\n<B>Security</B>\n<P>\nWeb security has been my abiding interest at the W3C. Web security\nbattles in the market were at their peak in spring 1995; I left\nschool immediately to rush out to W3C to get started. Within three\nweeks, I formulated and presented our strategy to the Advisory\nCommittee, and we've followed through with it by and large for\nthe last two years. Over 1995, I drafted several technical proposals\nfor adding security to HTTP, including the Security Extension\nArchitecture (SEA) for our expert Security Editorial Review Board\n(Ron Rivest, Butler Lampson, Jeff Schiller and others). These\nresults were presented to our member organizations' security experts\nat quarterly working group meetings around the world (seven at\nlast count). I have also been tracking related developments in\nthis area intensively. I've attended and spoken at several related\nprofessional conferences (RSA Data Security series, USENIX security\nworkshop, DIMACS Workshop on Trust Management, National Research\nCouncil Information Systems Trustworthiness Project / Workshop\non Rights Management).\n<P>\nIn 1996, we focused on deploying the first part of the security\nplan, digital signatures. I outlined a novel approach to security\nbased on signed assertions rather than digital signatures alone.\nI worked closely with Jim Miller to line up academic, commercial,\nand government support from a wide range of organizations. The\nDSIG meeting series dates back to April 1996 and represents our\nmajor success in the security arena. Recently, I have been working\nwith project manager Philip DesAutels to write several key documents:\nthe overall architecture, signature label design, and key technical\nspecifications for the cryptography and label embedding. I have\nhelped supervise a Master's student who has been implementing\na trust engine which implements user policies based on signed\nassertions.\n<P>\nI have represented the W3C in other security-related projects\nat the IETF: DNS security, email security as it impacts HTTP/MIME,\nand Transport Layer Security, where I have been running the mailing\nlist.\n<UL>\n<LI>Proposed Digital Signature Architecture\n<LI>Digital Signature Label Architecture\n<LI>Presentation on the history of W3C's involvement in security\nand electronic commerce (4th International Web Conference)\n<LI>Presentation on W3C's approach to layered web security (1996\nRSA Data Security Conference)\n<LI>Working Draft on the Security Extension Architecture (SEA)\n</UL>\n<P>\n<B>JEPI</B>\n<P>\nElectronic Payment was 'separated at birth' from Web Security.\nFrom the beginning, W3C has maintained parallel tracks of interested\nmembers on these two topics. During 1995, I worked with Philip\nand Jim to host several Payments WG meetings and edited overview\npapers and web pages. The first set of undergraduate researchers\nI supervised began working in this area, by simulating electronic\nshopping malls. Near the end of that year, Jim helped seed the\nidea of JEPI, the Joint Electronic Payments Initiative with CommerceNet.\nBeginning with videoconferences in Dec 95 and a kickoff meeting\nin Jan 96, W3C brought key browser, server, payment, and merchant\nplayers together to work on the critical glue technology for integrating\nelectronic payments with the Web. \n<P>\nI worked closely with Donald Eastlake and technologists from each\nof the participating firms to develop the technical proposal at\nthe heart of JEPI. This interacted strongly with the parallel\ndevelopment of PEP. Development proceeded throughout spring and\nsummer through to August '96 in a series of face-to-face and teleconference\nsessions. My role in this project has reduced since Daniel Dardailler\nbecame project manager and Eui-Suk Chung took over as technical\ncontact.\n<P>\nOur efforts in developing and prosyletizing JEPI have been very\nsuccessful to gauge by the massive interest in JEPI2.\n<P>\nI also was technical liason to the Financial Services Technology\nConsortium and participated in the First USENIX Workshop on eCommerce.\nI am also a founding member of the Digital Commerce Society of\nBoston.\n<UL>\n<LI>Selecting Payment Mechanisms Over HTTP\n</UL>\n<P>\n<B>PEP</B>\n<P>\nPEP is the technology underlying several of the initiatives of\nthe Technology &amp; Society Domain. I have worked closely with\na long list of HTTP designers to understand this problem area\nand make cogent proposals. This has been a substantially more\ndifficult assignment than anyone foresaw, especially with the\njoint proposal of technology for extension <I>and</I> negotiation\nover extensions to use. I have created several drafts of the technology\nand trained several dozen people in its use. It's been a major\neducation to work with the IETF and the IETF process.\n<P>\nI have also worked closely with Henrik and Anselm to prepare prototype\nimplementations in our code base. I have supervised undergraduate\nresearch students who have worked on separate implementations\nas well.\n<UL>\n<LI>HTTP/1.1 Extension Protocol (PEP)\n</UL>\n<P>\n<B>PICS</B>\n<P>\nSupported Jim, Paul Resnick and others in the technical design,\nreview, and current evolution of PICS. Work on Digital Signature\ninitiative fed into PICS-1.2 revision.\n<P>\n<B>Web Journal</B>\n<P>\nEditor-in-Chief of the World Wide Web Journal (W3J), an official\npublication of the W3C published by O'Reilly &amp; Associates.\nI was responsible for setting the theme, selecting articles, editing\ntechnical papers, and more. Prepared three issues to date: <I>The\nWeb After Five Years</I> (Demographics), <I>Building an Industrial\nStrength Web</I> (HTTP and related protocols), <I>Advancing HTML:\nStyle and Substance</I> (User Interface technology), and upcoming\nissues on scripting languages and Web Security.\n<H2>Other Activity Areas</H2>\n<P>\n<B>Demographics</B>\n<P>\nThere is intense commercial interest in understanding the demographics\nof Web usage, which must be balanced against users' privacy concerns\nin Web protocols. I coordinated W3C activity in this area from\nFall 1995 to Summer 1996. \n<P>\nOne of the highlights was organizing and speaking at the W3C/MIT\nWorkshop on Internet Survey Methodology and Web Demographics.\nAt the same time, I became heavily involved in the HTTP state-management\nsubgroup preparing a specification for user-tracking 'cookies',\ncurrently an IETF Proposed Standard.\n<P>\n<B>Architecture Domain</B>\n<P>\nWhiteboard discussions with the experts about the future of the\nWeb have been the real joy of this job. As W3C's &quot;Technology\nExpert&quot;, I have participated in W3C workshops and specifications\nabout mobile code, scripting languages, distributed objects, fonts,\nprinting, link architecture, and the design of next-generation\nHTTP. Along the way, I also took on the role of liason to the\nObject Management Group and MIT researchers working on caching\nand naming systems.\n<P>\n<B>Web Conference Series</B>\n<P>\nI participated, reviewed papers, and spoke at the Fourth and Fifth\nInternational Web Conferences. I am also the official W3C liason\nto the upcoming Sixth Conference, responsible for the W3C conference\ntrack, panels, and developer day programs.\n<H1>Additional Outside Activities</H1>\n<P>\nReviewed WebObjects technology in July 1996 Byte magazine.\n<P>\nCorporate Internet strategy consulting for Roadrunner Technology,\nCanon, and Bain &amp; Co.\n<H1>Classes taken at MIT</H1>\n<P>\n<B>6.852J Distributed Algorithms </B>\n<P>\nDesign and analysis of concurrent algorithms, emphasizing those\nsuitable for use in distributed networks.
