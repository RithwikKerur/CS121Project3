Here's what I do:\n\nWhen a win is acheived, count up how many more moves it requires the loser \nto clear his stones.  This is the winner's \"score\" for the game.  BUT!  If \nthe winner played first, SUBTRACT ONE from his score -- this reflects the \nadvange of playing first.  If the winner DID NOT play first, ADD one to \nhis score.\n\nThis way, if you begin, and you only win by one move, your win was an \n\"empty\" one.  It scored no points.  Your win was based solely on the fact \nthat you got to play first.\n\nI've also been developing my strategy as the second player.  I find it \nhelps tremendously to keep my outside stone back a little, wait for the \nopponent to rush to the corner, and then move my outside stone one step to \nthe inside.  This allows me to slip my stone in behind his.\n\nThe added bonus is that I now have a wall two stones long in the next to \nlast row.  Often, the opponent if forced to move his stones the long way \naround to circumvent the wall (my opponents seem reluctant to push the \ncorner stone off the board, even though it is now useless strategically.  \nUsually, pushing off the corner stone will force me to separate my wall at \nsome point -- simply because I will have run out of other moves.  This \nthen allows the opponent to slip a stone between mine, and he is back to \nthe \"corner\" advantage, though one line back from the actual corner.)\n\nOY!  I hope this wasn't too confusing.  A little standard nomenclature \nwould have helped, I think.\n\nPLEASE, more responses!  If people are simply not responding because they \nare not familiar with the game, get to know it!  It's really fun!\n\n(Oh... any chance of you still having that program around?  I'm just \nstarting to learn C, so I can't write my own quite yet.  What method did \nyou use for the computer AI?  On a small board, I'm wondering if genetic \n(evolutionary) algorithms would be worthwhile.

No doubt one of the authors (or perhaps Colin Vout) computed it\nby hand.  This is small enough that you could easily compute an\nexplicit winning strategy in a few milliseonds.  There's no need for\n\"AI\" when brute force will do!\n\nNot surprisingly, there are only three positions (six if you count\nreflections along the diagonal) that the second player wins with\nperfect play.  Hopefully my notation is obvious.\n\n    . &gt; &gt;     &gt; . .        &gt; &gt; .\n    . . ^       ^ . .       . . ^\n    . . .       . . .       . . ^\n\nOn a chess board (8x8), there are roughly 40 trillion (4 x 10^13)\npositions with all the stones on the board, and a few more with one or\nmore stones off the board, which is just a little too large to store\nexplicitly.  I'd guess that most of these positions are trivial wins\nfor one player or the other --- just run off the board as fast as\npossible, ignoring the other player's moves entirely.  These positions\ncould probably be identified just be counting distances to the goal.\nThere might be few enough \"interesting\" positions to store a complete\nwinning strategy.  (This is all just guessing.  I haven't actually\ntried.)\n\nI wouldn't expect the computer implementation to get really\ninteresting until you start playing on a go board.\n\nOne final question: On a 3x3 board, infinite play is possible, but\nstupid.  Is there a Dodgem position, on a board of some larger size,\nwhere perfect play results in a hung game?  I strongly suspect the\nanswer is no, but I don't see how to prove it.\n\n-- \nJeff Erickson\n<a href=\"mailto:jeffe@cs.uiuc.edu\">jeffe@cs.berkeley.edu</a>\n<a href=\n\"http://sal.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/\">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jeffe</a>\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     rec.games.abstract\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:davidmb@aisb.ed.ac.uk\">davidmb@aisb.ed.ac.uk</a> (David McBryan)\n<b>Subject:</b>        Re: \"Dodgem\" . . . any info?\n<b>Organization:</b>   Dept of Artificial Intelligence, Edinburgh University, Scotland\n<b>Date:</b>           Tue, 5 Mar 1996 12:51:31 GMT\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nIn article &lt;4h5g34$k4@news.nstn.ca&gt;, <a href= \n\"mailto:tetsuo@fox.nstn.ca\">tetsuo@fox.nstn.ca</a> (Marc Fleury) writes:\n|&gt;   I found an excellent abstract game, but it doesn't seem to be \n|&gt; mentioned in this group's charter.

We also wrote a program to play this which \nalways wins when it plays first and can only be beaten in one way when it \nplays second.

Does this work even if the flock has a\nlarger field to run on?  Suppose we call N-of-M Dodgem the game played\non an N x N board with M pieces on each side.  So regular Dodgem is\n2-of-3 and you've looked at 3-of-4 and 4-of-5.  What about 3-of-5?\n3-of-6?\n\nA surer way of making the game drawless is to forbid repeated\npositions.
