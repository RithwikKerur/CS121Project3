The model takes into\nexplicit consideration the cache-oriented nature of inputs and\noutputs in modern CPUs. I will present a parallel sorting algorithm\nwhich is provably optimal in both running time and cache-miss rate.\n<p>\nThis is joint work with Michael Goodrich and Michael Nelson.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
