The hour and a half between the talks and the banquet on Saturday evening was (barely) enough to hike to the top of it and back. The town is to the left of the hill, and the Banff Lodge is on this side of the Bow River from the hill. The hoodoos on the river are where it meets a low bluff in the right background.\n<h5>Taken Thursday, August 20, 2009, 08:39:22AM.\nOriginal image size: 3888x1944, 1.7Mb<br>\nTechnical details: Canon EOS 40D, 1/200s@ F11, ISO 100, 15mm f/2.8 Fisheye (24mm equiv)<br>\nPS CS2 Sat20 RC-30, USM all but fg 20:200 20:2, USM L 20:200</h5>\n</div></body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
