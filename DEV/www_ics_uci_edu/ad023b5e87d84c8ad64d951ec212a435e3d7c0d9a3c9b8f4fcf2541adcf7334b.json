Among\nthe many benefits touted for process-centered environments are the ability to\nautomate various aspects of a process and the ability to monitor the progress\nof a process in order to guide, enforce, or measure that process.  This\napproach has shown great promise and indeed has even shown some early\nsuccesses.  Unfortunately, this emphasis on computerization in general, and\non process-centered environments in particular, tends to focus attention on\nexactly those aspects of process that can be computerized, while giving short\nshrift to those aspects not amenable to computerization.\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:35:22 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
