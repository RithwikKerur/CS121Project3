I will for all k show tight bounds on the\nnumber of maximal independent sets of size at most k, and give\nalgorithms for finding all maximal independent sets of size at most k.\nThen I will show how to use these algorithms to design better\nalgorithms for colouring graphs.</p>\n\n<p>I will also discuss a generalisation of maximal independent sets,\nnamely maximal k-colourable subgraphs and give some upper and lower\nbounds on the number of these.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the talk is based on my SODA paper: \"Algorithms for k-Colouring\nand Finding Maximal Independent Sets\".</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
