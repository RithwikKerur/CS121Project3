What possible values can this number take? \n\n<p>More formally, if one has a <i>tiling</i> of the plane (a\ncollection of disjoint connected open sets the closures of which cover the\nplane), the <i>first corona</i> of a tile is the set of all tiles\nthat have a common boundary point with the tile, including the\noriginal tile itself. The <i>second corona</i> is the set of tiles\nthat share a point with something in the first corona, and so on.\nThe Heesch number of a shape is the maximum value of <i>k</i> for\nwhich all tiles in the <i>k</i>th corona of any tiling are\ncongruent to that shape.</p>\n\n<p>The Heesch number of a triangle, quadrilateral, regular hexagon,\nor any other shape that can tile the plane, is infinity.\nConversely, an argument based on the axiom of choice shows that a\nshape with infinite Heesch number must tile the plane. But the\nHeesch number of a circle is zero, because it can't even be\nsurrounded once by copies of itself without leaving some uncovered\nspace.</p>\n\n<p>Heesch's problem is to determine the largest possible finite\nHeesch number, or more generally what values other than zero and\ninfinity can occur as the Heesch numbers. For a long time the\nrecord holder was a shape found by Robert Ammann, consisting of a\nregular hexagon with small projections on two sides and matching\nindentations on three sides. It was believed that\nthis shape had Heesch number three, until in April 2000\n<a href=\"mailto:jupe@earthlink.net\">Alex Day</a> pointed\nout that the actual number is four (perhaps this simply reflects\na disagreement on the definition of a tiling, since his tiling is not\nsimply connected -- the common boundary of certain pairs of tiles is\ndisconnected).</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"heesch.gif\" alt=\n\"Amman's tile with Heesch number four\" width=367 height=409>\n</div>\n\n<p>As can be seen in the picture above, there exist tilings in which\ncopies of the same\nshape are used all the way out to the fourth corona. One way of\nproving that this gives the Heesch number of this shape would be to\ngo through a case analysis showing that no fifth-corona tiling is\npossible.</p>\n\n<p>However a more elegant argument is possible. First note that one\ncan not even produce a single corona without placing the tiles\naccording to the standard hexagonal tiling, with indentations on\none tile matched by projections on the adjacent tile. If one could\nfill the fourth corona this way, it would have 61 hexagons, 122 projections,\nand 183 indentations, so there would be at least 61 unmatched\nindentations on the outside boundary of the corona. However the\nsame fourth corona would have only 54 hexagon edges on its outside\nboundary, which is not enough to hold all those unmatched\nindentations. Therefore the only way to fill the fourth corona is to\nmatch some pairs of indentations with flat sides or each other,\nforming small holes that prevent the creation of a fifth corona.</p>\n\n<p>If, instead, we had formed a tile with three projections and two\nindentations per hexagon, the same argument would show that its Heesch\nnumber is three.</p>\n\n<p>Other shapes are known with Heesch numbers one or two (see for\ninstance Anne Fontaine, \"An infinite number of plane figures with\nHeesch number two\", <i>J. Comb. Th. A</i> 57 (1991) 151-156). Very\nrecently there has been significant progress on the problem: W. R.\nMarshall found a shape with Heesch number four\n(formed by indenting and outdenting the union of two hexagons, prior to\nDay's discovery that Heesch's tile achieves the same number), and\n<a href=\"http://math.uttyler.edu/cmann/math/heesch/heesch.htm\">Casey Mann</a>\nhas found a similarly indented and outdented pentahex with Heesch number\nfive! (Or maybe even six with the same definition as Day.)</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><IMG src=\"Heesch5.gif\" alt=\n\"Mann's tile with Heesch number five\" width=\"469\" height=\"530\" ALT=\"\">\n</div>\n\n<p>It remains open whether any polygon has higher Heesch number,\nbut these new techniques seem very powerful and likely to lead to\nfurther results. Mann writes that that \"rounder\" polyominoes than\nthe long-skinny ones he's been using may have a better chance of\ngiving unbounded Heesch numbers.</p>\n\n<p>The Heesch number question seems closely connected to two other\nfamous open tiling problems: does there exist an algorithm for\ndetermining whether a shape can tile, and does there exist a shape\nthat can only tile aperiodically? Aperiodic tiling seems to act as\na barrier to the existence of tiling algorithms, so it is not\nexpected that both of these problems have the same answer. On the\nother hand, if no finite Heesch number is larger than some <i>\nk</i>, then it seems that this could be used as the basis of an\nalgorithm to test whether a shape tiles: simply attempt to fill out\na tiling to the (<i>k</i>+1)st corona; if successful, the shape\nmust tile the plane, and if not, the shape does not tile.</p>\n\n<p>One can also ask similar questions about Heesch numbers for\ntilings in higher dimensions, for plane groups other than\ncongruence, or for restricted classes of shapes, however I don't\nknow any answers...</p>\n\n<p><b>See also:</b></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.uwgb.edu/dutchs/symmetry/heesch.htm\">S.
