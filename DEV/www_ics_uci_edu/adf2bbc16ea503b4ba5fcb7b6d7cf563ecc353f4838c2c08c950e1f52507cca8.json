The intent is\n  to give a few days for authors to review the draft and suggest changes before\n  it is submitted as an Internet Draft during the week of June 14th.\n\n* There was brief discussion on Section 12 (\"Dependencies on Other Specifications\"),\n  which currently is TBD.  Consensus is we don't need this section.\n\n* Judy Slein agreed to revise the requirements document, and have a new revision\n  available by the end of this week.  She will remove requirements for direct\n  references, and add requirements for bindings, in order to make the requirements\n  more reflective of the final form of the protocol specification.\n\n* There was a brief discussion on whether we should continue work on the\n  requirements document.  Since it is felt that the requirements document\n  is a good place for some of the rationale for the protocol functionality,\n  it is worth bringing this document to completion.\n\n* Geoff Clemm will be leading a review of the Advanced Collections specification\n  at the WebDAV WG meeting in Oslo.\n\n*** Meeting Adjourned ***", "encoding": "ascii"}
