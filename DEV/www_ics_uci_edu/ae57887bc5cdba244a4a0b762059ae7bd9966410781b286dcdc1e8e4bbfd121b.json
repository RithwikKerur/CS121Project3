In particular,\n    attention is directed towards the use of Lagrangean relaxation. The Multi-objective\n    problem to which most effort is devoted here is the Maximum Covering\n    Shortest Path (MCSP) problem. MCSP seeks a path in a network, from starting\n    (source) node to terminus (sink) node, which is simultaneously as short\n    as possible and covers the maximum population (by passing within a 'covering\n    distance'). Our approach differs from the existing one, based on use\n    of a general integer programming package, using a Lagrangean relaxation\n    approach instead. The subproblems generated are simple shortest route\n    problems relative to reduced arc lengths. This avoids the difficulty\n    of 'isolated circuits' (subtours) encountered previously. On the other\n    hand, care has to be taken to prevent the occurrence of negative length\n    circuits (relative to reduced arc lengths). Some experimental results\n    are presented. Subgradient optimisation is used for the Lagrangean dual\n    problem. A branch-and bound algorithm is also implemented for closing\n    any duality gap (which may result from the integrality constraints).\n    Our approach to MCSP also uses K-shortest path, and a suitable algorithm\n    for this is devised. The new method called Anticipatory Nemhauser, is\n    presented together with the data structures used and shown to be very\n    promising in terms of computation time required. The other problems,\n    considered briefly, are the Hierarchical Network Design Problem (HNDP)\n    and the Median Shortest Path Problem (MSPP). For the first of these a\n    dual-based scheme is developed and applied to an example with considerable\n    success but further experimentation is required to establish the merits\n    of our approach more generally. The relationship between MSPP and HNDP\n    is considered. Finally, the last chapter presents our conclusions and\n    suggestion for further work.}}\n\n@inproceedings{AggSchTok-SCG-93,\n  title = {{Finding a minimum weight $K$-link path in graphs with Monge property\n    and applications}},\n  author = {Alok Aggarwal and Baruch Schieber and T.

We propose a cost\n    function for the route assignment problem and secondly, we propose the\n    k-shortest route extraction method for the candidate extraction problem.\n    This method is based on the k-shortest path algorithm, and extracts only\n    routes whose number of hops is limited by the largest length among the\n    shortest routes for all the SD pairs without loops and redundant nodes.\n    The number of different extracted candidates is also limited by the minimum\n    number of hops for each request. Thirdly, we propose the greedy neural\n    network algorithm for the route selection problem. The greedy neural\n    network consists of the greedy initialization method with the number\n    of hops of the corresponding candidate, the motion equation with the\n    w function and the new term of minimizing the cost function, and the\n    one dimensional maximum neutron model. Through simulations in up to 500-node\n    networks, we verify that our algorithm finds better solutions in shorter\n    time with smaller space than the existing algorithms.}}\n\n@article{BabFunNis-SCJ-99,\n  title = {{A proposal of a greedy neural network for route assignments in\n    multihop radio networks}},\n  author = {T.

All the conditions enforced on the problem are incorporated\n    in the network itself, except for the staff-covering constraints which\n    are treated as side constraints. The optimal solution to the problem\n    is a path in the network and is identified using a dual-based approach.\n    The model deals with the three issues of recreation period identification,\n    work/recreation period sequencing and shift scheduling simultaneously,\n    and is designed to handle multiple shifts with time varying demands.\n    A software package which includes the network model along with the solution\n    technique is developed.

In this paper a\n    new bicriterion model, which can evaluate in a more realistic way the\n    attractivity of an RTL is introduced. To calculate an estimation of the\n    non-inferior solution set of the problem, a procedure based on a k-shortest\n    path algorithm was developed.

A fundamental\n    problem in PERT networks is to determine the probability distribution\n    function (pdf) of the realization time of the project completion time\n    $T_N$. An equally important problem in PERT networks is to identify the\n    activities and paths that are critical to the achievement of the project\n    objectives. Determining the exact pdf of $T_N$ is difficult. In this\n    thesis we develop two procedures to approximate such pdf's. The first\n    procedure assumes the independence of the paths in PERT network. It starts\n    at node 1 and proceeds sequentially to nodes $2, 3, \\ldots$, until it\n    finally reaches node $N$; at each node it approximates the pdf of its\n    realization time. The second procedure uses the series-parallel decomposition\n    to reduce the AN to only one activity starting at node 1 and ending in\n    node $N$. The pdf of the duration of the equivalent activity $(1, N)$\n    approximates the pdf of the project completion time. In the second problem\n    if the duration of each activity is constant, then it is relatively easy\n    to identify the critical path(s) and activities. In contrast such an\n    identification is very difficult in PERT network. In this dissertation\n    we first define the concepts of critical path(s) and activities, then\n    develop procedures to identify the criticality of every activity and\n    the top $K$ critical paths. To be able to test the accuracy of the approximating\n    procedures developed in this thesis, a random AN generator was developed\n    to generate a network $G(N,A)$ at random from the space of all feasible\n    networks with $N$ nodes and $A$ arcs; also, a crude Monte Carlo sampling\n    model was developed to approximate the pdf's of the realization times\n    of every node and the criticality measures of the activities and the\n    paths.

In theory, maximal rerouting capacity is obtained with\n    a maximum flow (Max Flow) criterion. However, rerouting that realizes\n    the k-successively shortest link disjoint paths (KSP) may be faster,\n    easier, and, in distributed implementation, more robust than a distributed\n    counterpart for Max Flow. The issue is, therefore, what the restoration\n    capacity penalty is if KSP is used instead of Max Flow. To explore this\n    tradeoff, the authors present a comparative study of the effectiveness\n    of KSP versus Max Flow as an alternative rerouting criteria in the context\n    of transport network span restoration. The comparison applies to both\n    centrally controlled and distributed restoration systems. Study methods\n    include exhaustive span failure experiments on a range of network models,\n    and parametric and analytical investigations for insight into the factors\n    resulting in KSP versus Max Flow differences. The main finding is that\n    KSP restoration capacity is more than 99.9{\\%} of that from Max Flow in\n    typical network models. The hypothesis is made that a generalized 'trap'\n    topology is responsible for all KSP-Max Flow capacity differences.

Possible approaches for achieving\n    high sentence accuracy include applying complicated speech modeling techniques\n    or employing more knowledge sources when conducting the recognition search.\n    An alternative solution is to first apply an $N$-best decoding search\n    to obtain $N$ sentence hypotheses using pre-selected knowledge source(s)\n    and then re-score those hypotheses using other knowledge source(s) or\n    models. The proposed $N$-best keyword search algorithm derives all keyword\n    sentence hypotheses and the corresponding likelihood scores time-synchronously.\n    We show that the algorithm guarantees to find all sentence hypotheses.\n    To reduce the exponentially growing number of hypotheses, in practical\n    implementation we applied empirically derived thresholds to prune the\n    search.

An optimal algorithm for this problem exists [M.\n    Blum et al., J. Comput. System Sci. 7 (1973), 448--461; MR 48 {\\#}8256].\n    The present paper considers the problem of finding the $k$th smallest\n    element in a set of elements satisfying a partial order relation. A convenient\n    way to organize the elements of a set for this purpose is to consider\n    a binary min-heap, i.e. a partial order on the elements $x\\sb i$, $i=1,2,\\cdots,n$,\n    where $x\\sb i>x\\sb {\\lfloor i/2\\rfloor}$. In order to achieve a simple\n    upper bound of $O(k\\log k)$, the $k$ smallest elements in the set are\n    extracted via an auxiliary heap. The auxiliary heap is used to hold those\n    elements that are candidates for being the next smallest elements. \n    \n    In improving on the above bound, the elements in the set are grouped\n    into clans of equal size. By identifying groups of elements and using\n    the largest in the group, it is possible to reduce the complexity of\n    operation on the auxiliary heap. The largest of the largest element in\n    each clan serves as a bound on the $k$ smallest elements in the set and\n    is used to extract the subset of elements from which the $k$th smallest\n    is selected. An algorithm using the idea of clans is discussed for the\n    general problem of finding the $k$th smallest element in a forest of\n    heaps. \n    \n    Under a different strategy, the clans are redefined to consist of all\n    the elements of smaller clans, with the lowest-level clans having the\n    single smallest element. This allows the heap structure to represent\n    clans as they are organized bottom-up in an incremental fashion. By keeping\n    the size of a clan as small as necessary at any given time, the author\n    provides an algorithm with time complexity $O(k)$. \n    \n    This result represents an optimal algorithm for the problem of selecting\n    the $k$th smallest element in a set organized as a binary heap, since\n    the information-theoretic lower bound is known to be $\\Omega(k)$ [D.\n    E. Knuth, The art of computer programming, Volume I, second edition,\n    Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1975; MR 51 {\\#}14624]. This is an important\n    result, particularly from a theoretical perspective. The general problem\n    of selecting the $k$th smallest element in a set has many applications.\n    The author cites two example applications where the set of elements is\n    easily viewed as a binary heap: (i) enumeration of the $k$ smallest spanning\n    trees of a weighted undirected graph [G. N. Frederickson, in 32nd Annual\n    Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (San Juan, PR, 1991), 632--641,\n    IEEE Comput. Soc.

The problem of constrained\n    shortest (least cost) path routing is known to be NP hard, and some heuristics\n    have been proposed to find a near optimal solution. However, these heuristics\n    either impose relationships among the link metrics to reduce the complexity\n    of the problem which may limit the general applicability of the heuristic,\n    or are too costly in terms of execution time to be applicable to large\n    networks. We focus on solving the delay constrained minimum cost path\n    problem, and present a fast algorithm to find a near optimal solution.\n    This algorithm, called DCCR (Delay-Cost-Constrained Routing), is a variant\n    of the k-shortest path algorithm. DCCR uses a new adaptive path weight\n    function, together with an additional constraint imposed on the path\n    cost, to restrict the search space. Thus, DCCR can return a near optimal\n    solution in a very short time. Furthermore, we use the method proposed\n    by D. Blokh and G. Gutin (1995) to further reduce the search space by\n    using a tighter bound on path cost. This makes our algorithm more accurate\n    and even faster. We call this improved algorithm SSR+DCCR (Search Space\n    Reduction+DCCR). Through extensive simulations, we confirm that SSR+DCCR\n    performs very well compared to the optimal but very expensive solution.}}\n\n@article{HadChr-Nw-99,\n  title = {{An efficient implementation of an algorithm for finding $K$ shortest\n    simple paths}},\n  author = {E.

In the theoretical part of the second chapter the following problems\n    are discussed and algorithmically solved: shortest path problems, determination\n    of paths with maximal length, determination of negative circuits, and\n    k-shortest path problems. A detailed presentation of applications is\n    given for the solution of scheduling problems by means of network-planning.\n    These are considered in the third chapter. CPM, PERT and MPM, which are\n    algorithms to solve such problems, are shown to be special cases of the\n    methods described in Chapter 2. In Chapter 4, flow and tension problems\n    are solved: algorithms for the determination of maximal flows and flows\n    with minimal costs, minimal tensions and tensions with minimal costs\n    are described.

The same idea of representing paths as deviations\n    is central to my own paper ``Finding the $k$ shortest paths'', in which\n    I unfortunately neglected to cite the present reference.\n    \n    There is also a brief footnote discussing the problem of finding loopless\n    paths: ``If it is desired to avoid paths containing loops, $j$ must be\n    suitably restricted'' where $j$ is the destination of a deviation edge.\n     This footnote seems incorrect, since there are networks in which the\n    second-shortest loopless path is not a deviation of the shortest path.\n    \n    No worst-case analysis is given, although the authors give some heuristic\n    estimates based on the assumption that the network resembles a square\n    grid, in which case they estimate the time to be roughly $O(k\\sqrt{n})$\n    (I guess not counting the time to find the initial shortest path tree,\n    and with $k$ not too big). The authors' implementation is not completely\n    naive: they construct the deviations of each path only once, and save\n    memory by only storing the $n$ best deviations found so far.  It seems\n    from their $O(k\\sqrt{n})$ estimate that they understood how to compute\n    each deviation in constant time, but (for pathological networks) each\n    path can have $\\Theta(km)$ deviations, so their worst case should have\n    been asymptotically $O(k^2m)$. Some computational results of an implementation\n    on an IBM 650 are also included: for a given 99-node planar network,\n    their code took 5 minutes to find the shortest path tree and 18 minutes\n    to find the ten best paths.\n    \n    No abstract was included in the original paper.},\n  review = {MR-23-B2056}}\n\n@article{MR-23-B2056,\n  reviews = {HofPav-JACM-59},\n  journal = {Mathematical Reviews},\n  publisher = {Amer.

The\n    simulation moves the vehicles using macroscopic traffic flow relations\n    in discretized network segments, while tracking their positions. The\n    boundedly rational behavioral model assumed for the driver response captures\n    the driver decisions to stay on suboptimal but sufficing paths despite\n    the provided route information. The framework is applied to candidate\n    networks under information, to study the system performance under different\n    levels of usage of technology and different driver behavior parameters.\n    Two different programs were developed: one for networks with parallel\n    highways towards a single destination, and one for networks of general\n    shapes and multiple destinations. The former model with faster path processing\n    is also used for studying an idealized corridor for its stochastic-dynamic\n    equilibration behavior under information using iterative simulations\n    with available utility functions. The latter model is used for a realistic\n    city network similar to the core network of Austin, Texas. The path processing\n    component is developed carefully, and is flexible enough to model the\n    driver behavior of selecting from a few paths under non-mandatory guidance.\n    Efficient data structures are used for the efficient enumeration and\n    updating of k-shortest paths. If these paths are not updated every simulation\n    time step, the trip times on the existing k-paths are updated by efficient\n    routines using two possible algorithms: one intended for sequential processors\n    and another for a processor with vectorization capabilities. The results\n    provide important insights on the effectiveness of in-vehicle information.\n    Only a relatively small fraction (less than 30{\\%}) of the drivers may need\n    to be equipped to obtain almost all of the advantages of guidance, and\n    the system could get worse for higher percentages depending on the network\n    context.}}\n\n@inproceedings{JayThu-CGT-80,\n  title = {{Analysis of a spanning tree enumeration algorithm}},\n  author = {Rajagopalan Jayakumar and K.

In this paper, a lower\n    bound of $\\Omega(\\max(n, K^{1/2}\\log K))$ is given for selecting the\n    $K$th element in $X+X$, and thus in $X+Y$, for $K$ selecting the first\n    through the median element. Selection of gaps, that is, consecutive differences\n    in a sorted order, is shown to be $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ for all $K$. These\n    results hold also when inputs are restricted to integers. The problem\n    of selection on $X+X$ can be generalized to selection on the set of multisets\n    of size m chosen from $X$, where the multisets are ranked on the sums\n    of their elements. When m and n grow, selection of the $K$th largest\n    multiset of size $m$ is NP-hard when inputs are expressed in binary notation.\n    If subsets of $X$ are characterized as paths, circuits or spanning trees\n    of an edge-weighted graph, then selection of the $K$th largest such subset\n    of $X$ remains NP-hard.

It is well\n    known that the problems of determining tolerances and the stability radius\n    for the TSP are NP-hard so that in general it is not possible to obtain\n    the above-mentioned three subsets without spending a lot of computation\n    time. The question addressed in this paper is the following: assume that\n    not only an optimal tour is known, but also a set of k shortest tours\n    (k{$>$}or=2) is given. Then to which extent does this allow us to determine\n    the three subsets in polynomial time? It will be shown in this paper\n    that having k-best solutions can give the desired information only partially.\n    More precisely, it will be shown that only some of the tolerances can\n    be determined exactly and for the other ones as well as for the stability\n    radius only lower and/or upper bounds can be derived. Since the amount\n    of information that can be derived from the set of k-best solutions is\n    dependent on both the value of k as well as on the specific length vector,\n    we present numerical experiments on instances from the TSPLIB library\n    to analyze the effectiveness of our approach.}}\n\n@inproceedings{LibPooSie-ISMP-97,\n  title = {{Sensitivity analysis for combinatorial optimization problems\n    based on subsets of $k$-best solutions}},\n  author = {Marek Libura and Edo S. van der Poort and Gerard Sierksma and\n    Jack A.

Assuming that\n    a set of k-best solutions of this problem is known, we investigate the\n    possibility of solving various sensitivity analysis questions concerning\n    the weights of elements. We concentrate on the following problems: --\n    calculating so-called tolerances of weights with respect to an optimal\n    solution, defined as maximum individual changes of weights preserving\n    the optimality of this solution; -- describing the region of allowable\n    simultaneous changes of weights provided by tolerances of single weights;\n    -- computing so-called stability radius of an optimal solution, which\n    gives the maximum simultaneous changes of weights preserving the optimality\n    of this solution; -- determining the maximum relative error of a given\n    feasible solution as a function of accuracy of estimating the weights\n    of elements.

A proof\n    of this conjecture would establish Kano's remaining three conjectures.\n    Finally the authors consider the algorithmic complexity of generating\n    a spanning tree of weight $W\\sb k$. For fixed $k$ they obtain a polynomial-time\n    $(\\Theta((mn)\\sp {k-1}))$ algorithm. When $k$ is part of the input, the\n    associated integer weight decision problem (KMST) is shown to be NP-hard\n    using a reduction due to D. B. Johnson and S. D. Kashdan [J. Assoc. Comput.\n    Mach. 25 (1978), no. 4, 556--570; MR 80b:68054] for the related $k$th\n    best spanning tree problem (KBST). A simple branch-and-bound algorithm\n    exists for KBST with a running time that is pseudo-polynomial in $k$.\n    The authors regard this as a hopeful sign that a similar result might\n    be possible for KMST. The authors do not achieve this goal, but instead\n    obtain an algorithm for KMST for which the running time is pseudo-polynomial\n    in the edge-weights as well as $k$. At the expense of an extra polynomial\n    factor this can be converted into an algorithm for generating a representative\n    of $W\\sb k$. The existence of a pseudo-polynomial (in $k$ alone) algorithm\n    for this problem remains an open question.}}\n\n@article{MegTamZem-SJC-81,\n  title = {{An $O(n\\log^2 n)$ algorithm for the $k$th longest path in a tree\n    with applications to location problems}},\n  author = {Nimrod Megiddo and Arie Tamir and Eitan Zemel and R.

Self-healing techniques have been proposed to provide\n    service continuity to end-users by autonomously switching affected virtual\n    paths to alternate routes. However, their success greatly depends on\n    how traffic is distributed and spare capacity is dimensioned over the\n    network when a failure occurs. Therefore, a fast restoration mechanism\n    alone is not enough to achieve a high level of survivability. This dissertation\n    aims at defining an integrated framework for survivable ATM network management\n    ranging from network design and virtual path management to fast restoration\n    protocol. The focus is placed on two aspects essential to promoting restoration\n    capability: the survivable virtual path routing (SVPR) and the survivable\n    capacity and flow assignment (SCFA). The SVPR attempts to maximize restorability\n    from a possible network failure by adjusting virtual path configuration\n    in response to a change in traffic demand or facility network configuration.\n    The two-step restoration concept is also introduced to achieve fast restoration\n    as well as optimal reconfiguration. The SCFA seeks for the most economical\n    physical link capacity placement in order to deploy a survivable network\n    in a cost-effective manner. Joint optimization is carried out to find\n    a globally optimal solution. The problems for maximum-flow restoration-based\n    networks are formulated as a large-scale linear programming model. Several\n    mechanisms are devised to reduce computation time by facilitating the\n    basis matrix factorization. The SVPR for k-shortest path restoration-based\n    networks is modeled as a non-smooth multicommodity flow problem with\n    linear constraints. A modified flow deviation method is developed to\n    obtain a near-optimal solution in a reasonable computation time. Premature\n    convergence to a non-smooth point is avoided by properly adjusting optimization\n    parameters. Using the proposed optimization procedures, the minimum resource\n    installation cost is quantitatively analyzed for different fast restoration\n    schemes. Contrary to a wide belief in the economic advantage of the end-to-end\n    restoration scheme, this study reveals that the attainable gain could\n    be marginal for a well-connected and/or unbalanced network.}}\n\n@inproceedings{Nag-ICSLP-94,\n  title = {{A stochastic morphological analyzer for spontaneously spoken\n    languages}},\n  author = {M.

Alignments of proteins based on their\n    structures or of DNA sequences based on evolutionary changes are often\n    different from alignments that minimize edit distance. However, in many\n    cases (e.g. when the sequences are close), the edit distance alignment\n    is a good approximation to the biological one. Since, for most sequences,\n    the true alignment is unknown, a method that either assesses the significance\n    of the optimal alignment, or that provides few `close' alternatives to\n    the optimal one, is of great importance. \n    \n    A suboptimal alignment is an alignment whose score lies within the neighborhood\n    of the optimal score. Enumeration of suboptimal alignments is not very\n    practical since there are many such alignments. Other approaches that\n    use only partial information about suboptimal alignments are more successful\n    in practice.\n    \n    We present a method for representing all alignments whose score is within\n    any given delta from the optimal score.

It has far-reaching economic,social and political\n    effects. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) research and development\n    programs have been assigned the task of developing sophisticated techniques\n    and counter-measures to reduce traffic congestion to manageable levels,\n    and also achieve these objectives using area-wide traffic management\n    methods. During times of traffic congestion, the traffic network in a\n    transient, time-dynamic state, and resembles a dynamic network. In addition,\n    in the context of ITS, the network can accurately detect such transient\n    behavior using traffic sensors, and several other information gathering\n    devices. In conjunction with Operations Research techniques, the time-varying\n    traffic flows can be routed through the network in an optimal manner,\n    based on the feedback from these information sources. Dynamic Traffic\n    Assignment (DTA) methods have been proposed to perform this task. An\n    important step in DTA is the calculation of user-optimal, system-optimal,\n    and multiple optimal routes for assigning traffic. One would also require\n    the calculation of user-optimal paths for vehicle scheduling and dispatching\n    problems. \n    \n    The main objective of this research study is to analyze the effectiveness\n    of time-dependent shortest path (TDSP) algorithms and k-shortest path\n    (k-SP) algorithms as a practical routing tool in such intelligent transportation\n    networks. Similar algorithms have been used to solve routing problems\n    in computer networks. The similarities and differences between computer\n    and ITS road networks are studied. An exhaustive review of TDSP and k-SP\n    algorithms was conducted to classify and determine the best algorithms\n    and implementation procedures available in the literature. A new (heuristic)\n    algorithm (TD-kSP) that calculates multiple optimal paths for dynamic\n    networks is proposed and developed. A complete object-oriented computer\n    program in C++ was written using specialized network representations,\n    node-renumbering schemes and efficient path processing data structures\n    (classes) to implement this algorithm. A software environment where such\n    optimization algorithms can be applied in practice was then developed\n    using object-oriented design methodology. Extensive statistical and regression\n    analysis tests for various random network sizes, densities and other\n    parameters were conducted to determine the computational efficiency of\n    the algorithm. Finally, the algorithm was incorporated within the GIS-based\n    Wide-Area Incident Management Software System (WAIMSS) developed at the\n    Center for Transportation Research, Virginia Tech. The results of these\n    tests are used to obtain the empirical time-complexity of the algorithm.\n    Results indicate that the performance of this algorithm is comparable\n    to the best TDSP algorithms available in the literature, and strongly\n    encourages its possible application in real-time applications. \n    \n    Complete testing of the algorithm requires the use of real-time link\n    flow data. While the use of randomly generated data and delay functions\n    in this study may not significantly affect its computational performance,\n    other measures of effectiveness as a routing tool remains untested. This\n    can be verified only if the algorithm itself becomes a part of the user-behavior\n    feedback loop. A closed loop traffic simulation/ system-dynamics study\n    would be required to perform this task. On the other hand, an open-loop\n    simulation would suffice for vehicle scheduling/dispatching problems.}}\n\n@article{SugKat-IPSJ-85,\n  title = {{An algorithm for finding $k$ shortest loopless paths in a directed\n    network}},\n  author = {K.

Many real-world problems are formulated\n    as a shortest path problem and solved by a dynamic programming approach.\n    Recently there have been several studies on shortest path problems with\n    one or more knapsack type side constraints. In a constrained shortest\n    path problem every edge of the network has not only a distance but also\n    some weight such as time or cost. The paper concerns a type of constrained\n    shortest path problem in which the network has a weight imposed on its\n    nodes. For example, given a water price and its demand at every node,\n    the requirement is to find a sales route with maximal profit (=sales-cost)\n    that does not exceed the total supply Q. This is called the water salesman\n    problem. It is a subproblem derived from an existing vehicle routing\n    problem with supply constraints in a steel company. Two algorithms are\n    discussed for solving a generalized water salesman problem, including\n    the original one, where split deliveries of water are allowable. One\n    is based on dynamic programming where every state consists of two factors,\n    the current node and the remaining water supply.

The first algorithm can solve any water\n    salesman problem with 10 to 80 nodes but takes relatively more time.\n    The second one can solve almost all problems rapidly, but for some it\n    is forced to stop before obtaining the optimum solution because of memory\n    capacity.}}\n\n@inproceedings{SzePev-RECOMB-97,\n  title = {{Las Vegas algorithms for gene recognition: suboptimal and error-tolerant\n    spliced alignment}},\n  author = {Sing-Hoi Sze and Pavel A.

A key factor in achieving these goals is the physical layout\n    of manufacturing cells on the factory floor. A 'good' cellular layout\n    design will not only reduce capital investment, but also eliminate unnecessary\n    activities. For general facility layout problems, researchers and practitioners\n    alike have developed numerous algorithms and procedures. However, most\n    of the existing methods ignore the flow directions and the cyclic routes\n    in flow analysis. Also, these methods usually treat machine cells and\n    storage areas as points or squares of equal size, with no or little consideration\n    for their geometric characteristics. Moreover, these methods do not explicitly\n    plan an efficient overall flow pattern to guide the layout process. This\n    is despite the fact that improving the material flow through system facilities\n    is one of the most important goals in manufacturing system layout design.\n    To address these issues, this study develops a flow-network based hierarchical\n    interactive approach that encapsulates many important considerations\n    of cellular layout planning. This approach can be systematically executed\n    in a three-phase design procedure. Phase 1 uses an extension of the K-Shortest\n    Path technique (Double-Sweep Method) to rationalize the various flows\n    of a system into a master flow network.

The proposed method explicitly\n    considers the flow precedence in flow analysis and the geometric constraints\n    in the cell location and allocation process. Also, it integrates the\n    traffic aisle structure design into the layout process.

The search procedure\n    is based on a two-pass algorithm. In the first pass, a word graph is\n    constructed with standard time-synchronous beam search. The actual extraction\n    of N-best word sequences from the word graph takes place during the second\n    pass. With the implementation of a tree-organized N-best list, the search\n    is performed directly on the resulting word graph. Therefore, the parallel\n    bookkeeping of N hypotheses at each processing step during the search\n    is not necessary. It is important to point out that the proposed N-best\n    search algorithm produces an exact N-best list as defined by the word\n    graph structure. Possible errors can only result from pruning during\n    the construction of the word graph. In a postprocessing step, the N candidates\n    can be rescored with a more complex language model with highly reduced\n    computational cost.

The automation characteristics of ALS offers significant\n    potential for increase in productivity, improvement in landfill space\n    management, and reduction in risk to workers in the landfill compaction\n    operation. The development of ALS requires: (1) Efficient space model\n    to maintain the landfill configuration, (2) Space management to monitor\n    landfill space consumption and achieve proper storage strategy, (3) Mapping\n    and positioning system to update landfill configuration in real-time,\n    (4) Instantaneous motion planning and controlling for multiple landfill\n    equipment, and (5) Measurement of in-situ waste density to avoid re-compaction.\n    This research focuses on the space model development, space model management,\n    multi-equipment motion planning, and a study of mapping and positioning\n    system. A 3-D Graphical Database System\n     (GDS) along with an Octree algorithm was developed as a space model\n    for a landfill site that will improve and assist the recovery program\n    as well as monitor the space usage of the landfill site. Space consumption\n    and waste information can be obtained easily by traversing the Octree\n    data structure via Octant's coding and property system. Furthermore,\n    Global Positioning System (GPS) technology can be used as a mapping and\n    positioning system to achieve the real-time space measurement for landfill\n    sites. An Instantaneous Motion Planning And Controlling Tool (IMPACT)\n    was developed to generate efficient and collision-free path for multiple\n    landfill equipment during the compaction operation. Each landfill equipment\n    will have a given starting point through which appropriate paths can\n    be determined while avoiding collisions with obstacles, other equipment,\n    and operators. The Quadtree-Cube algorithm, modified from Quadtree algorithm,\n    is proposed to address the motion planning for various types of landfill\n    equipment. The specific Network Graph can be extracted from the Quadtree-Cube\n    system for each piece of equipment. Then, IMPACT uses k-shortest path\n    algorithm to traverse the Network Graph. Subsequently, the IMPACT finds\n    a set of efficient and collision-free paths for each piece of landfill\n    equipment. An example application of IMPACT for landfill compaction operation\n    was also provided. The system has been implemented using a 3-D graphic\n    functional interface library--OpenGL, with C++ program binding.}}\n\n@article{TsuShiOza-ECJ-75,\n  title = {{An algorithm for generating the cycles of a digraph}},\n  author = {S.

Our model of constraint generation is specifically\n    developed for VHDL programs with such constructs. Control-flow paths\n    for which design verification tests are desired are specified through\n    certain annotations attached to the control statements in the VHDL programs.\n    These annotations are used to enumerate the desired paths.

Methods for generating constraint variables\n    corresponding to various types of carriers in VHDL and for mapping various\n    VHDL statements into mathematical relationships among these constraint\n    variables are developed. These methods treat spatial and temporal incarnations\n    of VHDL carriers as unique constraint variables thereby preserving the\n    semantics of the behavioral VHDL programs. Constraints are generated\n    in the constraint programming language CLP(R) and are solved using the\n    CLP(R) system. A solution to the set of constraints so generated yields\n    a design verification test sequence which can be applied for executing\n    the corresponding control path when the design is simulated.

These networks are referred to as multidimensional\n    networks and their properties are defined in this thesis. The motivation\n    is the emerging need for complex path algorithms arising from the development\n    of intelligent vehicle-highway systems (IVHS). A variety of problems\n    can be modeled and solved efficiently by the proposed approach: least-time\n    and least-cost path problems on networks with general time-dependent\n    arc costs, k-shortest path problems on uni- or multidimensional networks,\n    optimum path problems on networks with multiple user groups, intermodal\n    route planning problems, shortest path problems with penalties for intersection\n    movements, and stochastic shortest path problems. The general objective\n    of this thesis is to study the problem of computing optimum paths on\n    a multidimensional network from every node and dimensional element to\n    a destination node and a final dimensional element. One general approach\n    to model and solve these problems is to augment the network by adding\n    nodes and arcs, and applying conventional shortest path algorithms on\n    the resulting augmented network. However, augmentation is not always\n    possible, as in the case of continuous cost functions, and when it is\n    possible, it creates prohibitively large networks that are difficult\n    to represent, and code, and inflexible to alter. The proposed approach\n    does not require explicit expansion. It computes the paths for all the\n    dimensional elements simultaneously. It drives its efficiency by exploiting\n    the fact that the various dimensions share a common network topology.\n    The whole scheme can be easily expanded to include additional dimensions,\n    reflecting additional complexities of actual networks, without altering\n    the underlying network topology. The definition of the dimensions is\n    left open so the proposed approach is general and applicable to a broad\n    range of optimum path problems. For some dimension realizations, this\n    approach provides a solution to problems that were not addressed previously.\n    In other cases, it yields algorithms that are more efficient than existing\n    methods. The general solution approach is a dynamic programming approach,\n    both for the continuous and for the discrete time cases. The general\n    algorithms have computational disadvantages that restrict their applicability;\n    these disadvantages are identified and discussed along with a number\n    of common properties of the general optimum paths.}}\n\n@article{ZilMah-TRB-96,\n  title = {{A note on least time path computation considering delays and\n    prohibitions for intersection movements}},\n  author = {Athanasios Kostantine Ziliaskopoulos and Hani S.
