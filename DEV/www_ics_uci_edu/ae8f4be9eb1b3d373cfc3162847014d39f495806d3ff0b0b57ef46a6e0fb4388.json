In the process, he surveys which\nOSes are represented in the audience:\n<br>Microsoft NT, 9x, \u2026: most\n<br>MacOS: some\n<br>Linux: more than Mac\n<br>Palm OS: couple\n<p>How many own a web domain? Approx. half, some more than one.\n<p><b>Slide \"Authorization\":</b>\n<br>Rohit Khare, answered the rhetorical questions of the speaker, \"How\ndo you punish a key,\" with, \"No more multiplications for you [the key]!\"\n<p><b>Slide \" Three Namespace\":</b>\n<br>Remark buy Carl Hewitt: \"In the CIA, even the names of names are a\nsecret.\"\n<p><b>Slide \"Key as Global ID\":</b>\n<br>Some interlacing smart (funny, mostly sarcastic) remarks by the audience\non \"public key as global ID\".\n<p><b>Roy Fielding:</b> How do you get a collision free hash of the public\nkey?\n<br><b>Carl Ellison:</b> We assume that it's a collision free hash.\n<p><b>Slide \"Local Names\":</b>\n<p>SDSI \u2014 comparable to work of Einstein! Discard notion of global namespace,\nand realize that each one of us has our own namespace \u2026 and use that in\ninteractions with other people\u2026linking of my namespace to yours.\n<p><b>Slide \"Fully-qualified Names\":</b>\n<p><b>Q:</b> Does key refer to Fred or to Betty?\n<br><b>Carl Ellison:</b> Key refers to my key.\n<p><b>Bob Morgan:</b> It sounds like you're claiming that the string which\nhas the key in it is human-readable?\n<br><b>Carl Ellison:</b> No, only the local name is human friendly. I do\nnot believe it is possible to have a globally unique user friendly name.\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> How many keys are there?\n<br><b>Rohit Khare:</b> [A key is encoded in] 34 bits.\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> What's the population of the world? And how many\nbits does that amount to?\n<br><b>Rohit Khare:</b> {missed his answer}\n<p><b>Q:</b> If you try to name something using normal English, the entropy\nincreases \u2026 you get more density with email addresses, but that means some\nemails names are not human friendly \u2026\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> question about how to expand what it means to interpret\nan SDSI name chain\u2026 Karl\u2019s Jim\u2019s Therese \u2026 &lt;key>n1 n2 .. nN = kN\n<p><b>Esther Dyson:</b> As you say if there is only one [root], it is irrelevant.\n<br><b>Carl Ellison:</b> There will be more than one.\n<p><i>Post-presentation questions and answers:</i>\n<p><b>Bob Morgan:</b> How about identity changes?\n<br><b>Carl Ellison:</b> You can't analyze a person\u2019s name, your names\nremains your name ... There is this wonderful belief that a name cannot\nbe broken. Every year, you can attach a different key to your name \u2026but\nthe trouble is it requires X.500 or a single certifying authority to have\nsucceeded. There are millions of certificate authorities, and you tell\nthem apart by their root key. So a name that lives forever impossible only\nif there is NO root key \u2026. No need for key in (name &lt;key>n1n2 \u2026 nN)\n= kN the key here has the same cryptographic lifetime, and the same vulnerability\n\u2026\n<p>{Ed: Broader discussion of the issue. Speaker flips back to slide \"Fully-qualified\nNames\" to explain semantics of used syntax in more detail.}\n<p><b>Q:</b> So I lose my smart card .. do I lose access to everything?\n<p><b>Bob Morgan:</b> Your long lived name can and should be a public key&nbsp;\n\u2026 same procedure that a CA would use, only he does it frequently?\n<br><b>Carl Ellison:</b> Same procedure.\n<p><b>Rohit Khare:</b> A multifunctional smart card is a suspect idea.&nbsp;\nYou don\u2019t want to have a driver\u2019s license for a credit card to be issued.\n<br>&nbsp;\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
