The original graph can then be obtained by\nexpanding the tree bottom-up, blowing up the vertices at each node\ninto graphs coming from the corresponding subtrees. \n\n<p>Motivated by a recent paper [R. M. McConnel and J. P. Spinrad,\n\"Linear time modular decomposition and efficient transitive\norientation of comparibility graphs\", 5th SODA (1994) 536-545],\nGeorge discussed applications of modular decomposition to maximum\nweight independent sets, transitive orientation, and cograph\nrecognition, and described a method for constructing large prime\ngraphs.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
