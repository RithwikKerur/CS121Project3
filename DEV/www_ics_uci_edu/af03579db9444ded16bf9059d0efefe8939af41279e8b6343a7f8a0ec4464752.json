For which n can we get all the integers from n-1 to n(n-1)/2\n&gt;as possible numbers of distinct points of intersection?\n&gt;How would one attack this problem for general n?\n\nThis pattern does not continue forever -- for large n, there is\nno configuration of n lines which gives exactly n+1 intersection points.\n(I think that this is so for all n <U>&gt;</U> 10, but I have no proof of\nthis stronger statement.)\n\nHere is a sketch of the proof; the full proof would be rather long.\n\nSuppose we have a configuration of n lines giving n+1 intersection\npoints.  What is the largest number of lines in the configuration\nwhich are concurrent or parallel?\n\nThese two cases will come up so often that it will be easier to move\nto the projective plane, where there is no distinction between them.\nOf course, this has a cost; instead of just counting intersection\npoints, we have to count the points and then see how many can\nbe removed by arranging to have them lie on the \"line at infinity\"\nwhen converting back to the ordinary plane.  Note the restriction\nthat the line at infinity cannot be one of the n lines of the\nconfiguration.\n\nIf all n lines are concurrent, we only get 1 projective\nintersection point, which may be a finite point or a point\non the line at infinity, giving 0 or 1 ordinary intersection points.\nIf n-1 of them meet at one point but the n'th doesn't, then we get\nn-1 additional points from the n'th line, for a total of n;\nthis gives either n-1 or n finite points.\n\nIf the largest number of lines at a point is n-2, then the\n(n-1)'th line gives n-2 additional points, of which one may be infinite,\nand the n'th line also meets the first n-2 in n-2 points, of which\none may be infinite and one may lie on the (n-1)'th line,\nleaving at least n-4 new finite points.  Therefore, there are at least\n(n-3)+(n-4) = 2n-7 finite points, which is too many.\n\nSimilarly, if the largest number of lines at a point is n-3,\nthen we get at least (n-4)+(n-5)+(n-6) = 3n-15 finite\nintersection points.  Continuing this downward, we see\nthat, as long as k is large enough that (k-1)(k-2)/2 &gt; n+1,\nwe will get too many finite intersection points if there\nare k lines meeting at a point.  So, in the desired configuration,\nthe largest number of lines through a particular point is\nat most about sqrt(2n).\n\nNext, consider the case where two different points each have\nat least d lines passing through them.  One of these lines\nmight pass through both points, but this still leaves d-1\nother lines at each point, which produce (d-1)^2 intersection\npoints.  Since at most one of the points on each of the\nfirst d-1 lines can be on the line at infinity, we get\nat least (d-1)(d-2) finite intersection points.  Therefore,\nin the desired configuration, the point with the second-largest\nnumber of lines through it has at most about sqrt(n) such lines.\n\nIf one considers three points which each have at least d lines\nthrough them, then, with a substantial amount of extra work,\none can show that there must be at least 3d^2/2 - 6d + 3\nfinite intersection points.  (This bound isn't quite sharp,\nbut the leading term is.)  Therefore, in the desired configuration,\nevery point with at most two exceptions lies on at most D lines,\nwhere D is about sqrt(2n/3).\n\nNow, the n lines give n(n-1)/2 pairs of lines, and each such\npair has an intersection point (finite or infinite).  A point\nat which d lines meet takes care of d(d-1)/2 of these pairs.\nThere are only n+1 finite intersection points, and these\ncan take care of about (n+1)D(D-1)/2 ~ n^2/3 pairs.\n(The two possible exceptionally large intersection points\nwould only yield about 5n/3 additional pairs.)\nHow about points on the line at infinity?  The sum of the degrees\n(number of lines meeting there) of these points is at\nmost n, because each configuration line meets the line\nat infinity only once.  And we still have the bound D on the\nindividual degrees.  So a simple optimization argument shows\nthat the number of pairs with intersection point on the\nline at infinity is at most about (n/D)D(D-1)/2 ~ n^(3/2)/sqrt(6).\n(Again the two exceptional points only change this bound\nby O(n).)  Therefore, the total number of pairs of lines\nin the configuration is n^2/3 + o(n^2); since this is\nless than n(n-1)/2 for large n, we have a contradiction.\nThis completes the sketch of proof that no configuration of\nn lines gives n+1 intersection points if n is large.\n\nActually, the argument shows that no configuration of n lines\ngives between n+1 and cn intersection points, where c tends\nto 3/2 for large n.  I conjecture that, in fact, for large n,\nthe first attainable number of intersection points\nafter 0, 1, n-1, and n is 2n-6.\n\nRandall Dougherty                       <A HREF=\"mailto:rld@math.ohio-state.edu\">rld@math.ohio-state.edu</A>\nDepartment of Mathematics,  Ohio State University,  Columbus, OH 43210  USA\n\"I have yet to see any problem, however complicated, that when looked at in the\nright way didn't become still more complicated.\"  Poul Anderson, \"Call Me Joe\"\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:kjellpe@math.uio.no\">kjellpe@math.uio.no</A> (Kjell Fredrik Rogstad Pettersen)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Question from the classroom: Geometry\n<B>Date:</B>           7 Jun 1996 07:17:43 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   University of Oslo, Norway\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n[Ray Steiner]\n\n&gt; Of course,they can never meet! Again, I want to know if all numbers\n&gt; of intersection points are possible between n-1 and n(n-1)/2 if \n&gt; n&gt;3.

It is true for\nn=3,4,5,6,7,8,9 while it seems as if it is impossible for 10 lines\nto meet in 11 or in 12 points (but they may meet in 9,10,13,..,45\npoints). In general, I don't believe it is possible for n lines to\nmeet in n+1 points for n<U>&gt;</U>10.
