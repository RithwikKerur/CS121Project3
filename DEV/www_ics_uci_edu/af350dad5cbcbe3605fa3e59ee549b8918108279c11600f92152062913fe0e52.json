The dimensionality of the data for these \r\napplications ranges from low to high. Most existing methods have \r\nfocused on the execution of high-dimensional joins over large \r\namounts of disk-based data. \r\n\tThe increasing sizes of main memory \r\navailable on current computers, and the need for efficient processing  \r\nof spatial joins suggest that spatial joins for a large class of\r\nproblems can be processed in main memory. \r\n\tIn this paper we develop two new spatial join algorithms,\r\nthe Grid-join and EGO*-join,  and study their performance \r\nin comparison to the state of the art algorithm, EGO-join, and the\r\nRSJ algorithm. \r\n \r\nThrough evaluation  we explore the domain of applicability of each \r\nalgorithm and provide recommendations for the choice of join algorithm \r\ndepending upon the dimensionality of the data as well as the critical \r\nepsilon parameter. We also point out the significance of the choice \r\nof this parameter for ensuring that the selectivity achieved is \r\nreasonable. \r\nThe proposed EGO*-join algorithm always, often significantly, outperforms\r\nthe EGO-join. For low-dimensional data the Grid-join outperform both the\r\nEGO- and EGO*- joins. \r\n\r\nAn analysis of the cost of the Grid-join is presented and highly accurate cost \r\nestimator functions are developed. These are used to choose an appropriate \r\ngrid size for optimal performance and can also be used by a query optimizer\r\nto compute the estimated cost of the Grid-join.   \r\n</p> \r\n<BR>\r\n\r\n<p> <H3>Keywords:</H3>  \r\nSimilarity join, epsilon join, multidimensional join, high-dimensional join, selectivity, grid join, main memory join, EGO* join\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<p>\r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3> \r\n\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/DASFAA03_dvk.pdf\">DASFAA03_dvk.pdf</A><BR>\r\nPaper (revised extended version): <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/DASFAA03_dvk.ext.pdf\">DASFAA03_dvk.ext.pdf</A> \r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?DASFAA03_dvk\" width=1 height=1> \r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3>\r\n<pre>@inproceedings{DASFAA03::dvk,\r\n   author    = {Dmitri V.
