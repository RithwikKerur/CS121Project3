Because Tarjan's algorithm needs only the outgoing edges from each vertex, while Kosaraju's needs both incoming and outgoing edges. In a web graph, only the outgoing edges are directly available; we'd have to make an in-memory copy of the graph that includes lists of both incoming and outgoing edges in order to apply Kosaraju's algorithm.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
