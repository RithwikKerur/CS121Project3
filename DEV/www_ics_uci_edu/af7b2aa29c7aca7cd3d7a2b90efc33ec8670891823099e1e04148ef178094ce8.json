We then explored various architectural design alternatives, created a detailed design of the simulation environment, and implemented a non-graphical prototype simulation environment with a single, hard-coded model inside. We then did a major re-design of SimSE to be completely customizable so that an instructor can create their own software process models to be simulated in SimSE. This new version of SimSE, which includes a model builder and a code generator that generates a customized, fully graphical simulation environment, has recently been completed and is now available for <a href=\"downloads.html\">download</a>, along with an initial simulation model of a waterfall process . We are currently building three more models, one of a code inspection process, one based on the Rational Unified Process, and one based on Extreme Programming.</font><font color=\"black\" face=\"Copperplate Gothic Light\" ,=\",\"><span \n\n\n\nstyle=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span></font></span> </p>\n\n  </td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n<!-- #EndEditable -->\n<hr />\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td><p class=\"style1\">SimSE is funded by  NSF grant number DUE-0618869.</p>\n  </td>\n<td align=\"right\" width=\"50%\"><p><em>SimSE, University of California, Irvine</em></p>\n  <p><em>Copyright &copy;2010</em></p></td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</body>\n<!-- #EndTemplate --></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
