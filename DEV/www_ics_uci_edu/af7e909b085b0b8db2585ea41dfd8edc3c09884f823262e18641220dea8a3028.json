Maybee, Dennis H.\nHeimbigner, David L. Levine, and Leon J. Osterweil, University of\nColorado, Boulder.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nThis paper describes the motivation for, design and implementation of,\nand experience with, Q, a set of matched C and Ada interfaces designed\nto support interprocess communication between these two languages.\nQ's interfaces are adapted from the remote procedure call interface\nmodel.  Certain of these adaptations were ncessitated by the lack of\nkey C language features in the Ada language.  Additional features were\ninspired by language features present in Ada that are not commonly\nfound in C implementations.  Q defines an interprocess communication\nmodel common to both languages, and a type space common to both\nlanguages.  Q has evolved and been improved as a consequence of its\napplication and use.\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:26:47 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
