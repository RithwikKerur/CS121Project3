We'll show examples of\nsuch arguments, but also show some counterintuitive results arrived at in\nthis model.  Namely, we'll show that a straighforward implementation of an\nRSA-based signature scheme is only loosely related (in its security) to\nthe RSA problem, while a new scheme which essentially adds only one more\nbit to the signature does suddenly become as difficult as the underlying\nRSA problem.  How can one bit change so much?\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
