Expand\n\n(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 = R^2\n\nto\n\nx^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 = R^2\n\nSince this is non-linear in a, b, and R, it seems you can't easily use it to\nfind them.  But let\n\nq = R^2 - a^2 - b^2                        [1]\n\nand re-arrange to yield\n\n(2x)a + (2y)b + q = x^2 + y^2              [2]\n\nwhich is now linear in a, b, and q.  Apply at 3 points and solve by Cramer's\nrule:\n\n     |(x1^2 + y1^2) 2y1 1|\n     |(x2^2 + y2^2) 2y2 1|   |(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y2 - y1)|\n     |(x3^2 + y3^2) 2y3 1|   |(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y3 - y1)|\na = ---------------------- = ---------------------------------------\n        | 2x1  2y1  1 |           2 * | (x2 - x1)  (y2 - y1) |\n        | 2x2  2y2  1 |               | (x3 - x1)  (y3 - y1) |\n        | 2x3  2y3  1 |\n\nSimilarly,\n\n      |(x2 - x1) (x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2)|\n      |(y2 - y1) (x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2)|\nb = -----------------------------------------\n           (same denominator)\n\nThis is equivalent to Watson's formula, which he derived geometrically.  (A\nside note: Watson could have saved 3 more multiplications in his formula by\nincorporating a factor of 2 into his denominator term D.)  It's then cheaper\nto find R by the original equation than by applying Cramer's rule a 3rd time,\netc.\n\nThis can also be written down by comparing Eq. [2] with the 'three-point\nform':\n\n     | (x^2  + y^2)   x   y   1 |\n     | (x1^2 + y1^2)  x1  y1  1 |  = 0\n     | (x2^2 + y2^2)  x2  y2  1 |\n     | (x3^2 + y3^2)  x3  y3  1 |\n\nFor the sphere about a tet (after factoring out the 2's),\n\n     |(x1^2 + y1^2 + z1^2)  y1  z1  1 |\n     |(x2^2 + y2^2 + z2^2)  y2  z2  1 | \n     |(x3^2 + y3^2 + z3^2)  y3  z3  1 |\n     |(x4^2 + y4^2 + z4^2)  y4  z4  1 |\na = ------------------------------------\n         2 *  | x1   y1   z1  1 |\n              | x2   y2   z2  1 |\n              | x3   y3   z3  1 |\n              | x4   y4   z4  1 |\n\nand so on.

The advantage is that the relative error incurred in the\n  computation of r is also a function of the _differences_ between the\n  vertices, and is not influenced by the _absolute_ coordinates of the\n  vertices.  In most applications, vertices are usually nearer to each other\n  than to the origin, so this property is advantageous.  If someone gives you\n  a formula that doesn't have this property, be wary.\n\n  Similarly, the formula for m incurs roundoff error proportional to the\n  differences between vertices, but does not incur roundoff error proportional\n  to the absolute coordinates of the vertices until the final addition.\n\n- These expressions are unstable in only one case:  if the denominator is\n  close to zero.  This instability, which arises if the tetrahedron is nearly\n  degenerate, is unavoidable.  Depending on your application, you may want\n  to use exact arithmetic to compute the value of the determinant.\n  Fortunately, this determinant is the basis of the well-studied 3D orientation\n  test, and several fast algorithms for providing accurate approximations to\n  the determinant are available.  Some resources are available from the\n  \"Numerical and algebraic computation\" page of Nina Amenta's Directory of\n  Computational Geometry Software:\n\n  <A HREF=\"http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/cglist/alg.html\">http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/cglist/alg.html</A>\n\n  If you're using floating-point inputs (as opposed to integers), one\n  package that can estimate this determinant somewhat accurately is my own:\n\n  <A HREF=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html\">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/robust.html</A>\n\n- If you want to be even more aggressive about stability, you might reorder\n  the vertices of the tetrahedron so that the vertex `a' (which is subtracted\n  from the other vertices) is, roughly speaking, the vertex at the center of\n  the minimum spanning tree of the tetrahedron's four vertices.  For more\n  information about this idea, see Steven Fortune, \"Numerical Stability of\n  Algorithms for 2D Delaunay Triangulations,\" International Journal of\n  Computational Geometry &amp; Applications 5(1-2):193-213, March-June 1995.\n\nFor completeness, here are stable expressions for the circumradius and\ncircumcenter of a triangle, in R^2 and in R^3.  Incidentally, the expressions\ngiven here for R^2 are better behaved in terms of relative error than the\nsuggestions currently given in the Geometry Junkyard\n(<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html</A>).\n\nTriangle in R^2:\n\n     |b-a| |c-a| |b-c|            &lt; Note: You only want to compute one sqrt, so\nr = ------------------,             use sqrt{ |b-a|^2 |c-a|^2 |b-c|^2 }\n      | bx-ax  by-ay |\n    2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |\n\n          | by-ay  |b-a|^2 |\n          | cy-ay  |c-a|^2 |\nmx = ax - ------------------,\n            | bx-ax  by-ay |\n          2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |\n\n          | bx-ax  |b-a|^2 |\n          | cx-ax  |c-a|^2 |\nmy = ay + ------------------.\n            | bx-ax  by-ay |\n          2 | cx-ax  cy-ay |\n\nTriangle in R^3:\n\n    |                                                           |\n    | |c-a|^2 [(b-a)x(c-a)]x(b-a) + |b-a|^2 (c-a)x[(b-a)x(c-a)] |\n    |                                                           |\nr = -------------------------------------------------------------,\n                         2 | (b-a)x(c-a) |^2\n\n        |c-a|^2 [(b-a)x(c-a)]x(b-a) + |b-a|^2 (c-a)x[(b-a)x(c-a)]\nm = a + ---------------------------------------------------------.\n                           2 | (b-a)x(c-a) |^2\n\nFinally, here's some C code that computes the vector m-a (whose norm is r) in\neach of these three cases.

The advantage is that the relative error incurred in the\n&gt;   computation of r is also a function of the _differences_ between the\n&gt;   vertices, and is not influenced by the _absolute_ coordinates of the\n&gt;   vertices.  In most applications, vertices are usually nearer to each other\n&gt;   than to the origin, so this property is advantageous.  If someone gives you\n&gt;   a formula that doesn't have this property, be wary.\n\n...(part omitted)..... \n\n&gt; For completeness, here are stable expressions for the circumradius and\n&gt; circumcenter of a triangle, in R^2 and in R^3.  Incidentally, the expressions\n&gt; given here for R^2 are better behaved in terms of relative error than the\n&gt; suggestions currently given in the Geometry Junkyard\n&gt; (<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/triangulation.html</A>).\n\nIn a private response to Herr Kerscher's question, I recommended that he\nlook at this page, particularly my contribution to it. Let me say that\nProf. Shewchuk's criticism regarding relative error is not only correct,\nbut also of some practical significance. The good behavior which he\nrefers to is obtained for 2-D triangles using the particular form\n(attributed to Jim Ward) given by the most recent\ncomp.graphics.algorithms FAQ at\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/graphics/algorithms-faq/faq.html\">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/graphics/algorithms-faq/faq.html</A>\nThis form has the desired property of using only differences between\ncoordinates.\nAn added advantage when using integer arithmetic is that such forms\navoid overflows in many more practical cases (e.g., simplex far from\norigin).\n\nThus, my formula given in the Geometry Junkyard:\n\n     |(x1^2 + y1^2) 2y1 1|\n     |(x2^2 + y2^2) 2y2 1|   |(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y2 - y1)|\n     |(x3^2 + y3^2) 2y3 1|   |(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) (y3 - y1)|\na = ---------------------- = ---------------------------------------\n        | 2x1  2y1  1 |           2 * | (x2 - x1)  (y2 - y1) |\n        | 2x2  2y2  1 |               | (x3 - x1)  (y3 - y1) |\n        | 2x3  2y3  1 |\n\nneeds to be taken another step to achieve the desired property.\nThe terms in the first column of the numerator should be re-written like\nthis:\n\n(x2^2 + y2^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) = (x2 - x1)(x2 + x1) + (y2 - y1)(y2 + y1)\n\n(x3^2 + y3^2 - x1^2 - y1^2) = (x3 - x1)(x3 + x1) + (y3 - y1)(y3 + y1)\n\nThe formulas for tets in 3-D in the Geometry Junkyard need similar\ntreatment.\n\n-- \n*******************************************\nWilliam J.
