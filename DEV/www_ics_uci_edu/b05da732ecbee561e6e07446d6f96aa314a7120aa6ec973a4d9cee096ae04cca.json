Access Control Features\nWhen I speak of access control I mean the ability to associate a set of \nallowable actions to be performed on a resource by an entity as defined \nunder a specified security protocol. Actions are HTTP methods with \nspecified associated tags. Resources are a URL or a URL which references a \ngroup of URLs. Entities are defined by the particular security protocol \nbeing referenced. The versioning standard should include how to specify \nactions and resources but should only define an extension mechanism for \ndefining entities. It would be prudent to include in an appendix a syntax \nfor the definition of entities under commonly used HTTP authentication \nmethods such as the Authentication tag. Note that a server is not required \nto accept access control suggestions. Each server has its own rules for how \nactions, resources and entities should be divided and is free to enforce \nthose views. However error message should be used to inform the user of the \nserver's policies.\nIn addition means must be provided to discover what actions, resources, and \nentities are available. However this information should also be under \naccess control. It would seem logical to provide support in HTML for \nspecifying access control features so that a server could provide users who \nwish to set access controls with an HTML page whose formatting will help \nthe user assign access controls in a matter consistent with the server's \npolicies.\nAs access controls are the primary means for deciding how to share \ninformation it is critical that we define a standard or each versioning and \ndistributed authoring package will define its own. This would not be such a \nbad fate if only one or two people on a site needed to assign access \nprivileges. However everyone who owns a resource needs to set the access \nprivileges for that resource and if resources are to be shared across \nsystems then users who use different versioning and distributed authoring \npackages need to be able to control access to resources on other systems. \nThis interoperable world is only feasible if methods to define access \ncontrols are standardized.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYaron\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0122.html\">Yaron Goland: \"RE: Initial Dist.
