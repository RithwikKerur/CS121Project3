Whenever you observe a particularly\nbad example of interaction design (or a particularly good one), jot down\nthe details in your notebook.  Often these instances are fleeting and subtle;\nyou may think you&#39;ll remember and write it down later, but chances are\nyou won&#39;t, which is why we want you to carry the notebook and record the details\nwhen they occur.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(a)</B> Complete the <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/survey/infx131summer2015\">Informatics 131 Questionnaire</a> and do the other items on the syllabus under &quot;What to do to get started&hellip;&quot;, including signing yourself up at <a href=\"https://www.piazza.com/uci\">www.piazza.com.</a></FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>(b)</B> Pick two different instances of\n  bad design from your HCI notebook.  These may involve computer systems or\n  any human-created object.  For this part of the assignment, you may pick\n  relatively small, simple instances (like the signage in Donald Bren Hall, but don&#39;t pick ones we discussed in class). \n  For each,</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Describe the relevant details of the system\n(if your system wouldn&#39;t be familiar to the typical computer science\nstudent, give enough background description to explain it).</FONT><BR>\n<BR>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Explain the problem(s) you encountered, relating\nthem to failures of usability goals or principles.

Analyze it as described above, describing its HCI flaws in terms of Nielsen's guidelines, but in somewhat\nmore detail involving more than one feature or function.  As an upper limit,\ndon&#39;t spend more than an hour exploring the site and making notes, and\ndon&#39;t write more than two single-spaced pages of analysis (which again\nmay span more pages than that as you include illustrations).  Add this text to the same document you started in part (b). </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your analysis should address who the intended\nusers of the site are, what the users want to achieve by using the site,\nhow the site failed to serve these users and their goals (including, if\napplicable, characteristics of the users and their backgrounds that the\nsite designers didn&#39;t understand or accommodate well), and what makes\nyour suggested improvements better.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your analysis should focus on usability issues\nrather than pure functionality; while the line is sometimes hard to draw\n(adding a search feature, for example, is increased functionality that also\naffects the usability of a site), don&#39;t try to solve the problems by\nmaking the system into something that it wasn&#39;t intended to be.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Submitting your work:</B> Please make sure your name, student ID, and UCInet ID are at the top of your document.
