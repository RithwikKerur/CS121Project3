The outcome is often uncertain and\nunpredictable and, along with uncertainty in natural\nphenomena, inevitably leads to software risks and\nuncertainties.  Despite the pervasiveness of human\ninvolvement, surprisingly few techniques exist that\nmodel related software uncertainties explicitly.\nThis dissertation begins to remedy\nthis situation by presenting the Maxim of Uncertainty\nin Software Engineering, stating that ``Uncertainty\nis inherent and inevitable in software processes and\nproducts,'' and, as corollary, urging that software\nuncertainties be modeled explicitly.\n<P>\nIdeally, an uncertainty modeling\ntechnique should include probabilistic notions of\nuncertainty and confidence, support multiple factors\nof influence, and allow dynamic updating of uncertainty\nvalues during development.  Here, we claim that\nBayesian Belief Networks meet these desiderata and\nare therefore suitable for software uncertainty modeling.\n<P>\nWe are specifically interested in software traceability\nand how it may be improved through notions of judgment,\nconfidence, belief, evidence, and causal influence.\nTo this end, we posit a research hypothesis, stating that\nsoftware uncertainty modeling, specifically Bayesian\nnetwork modeling of developers' confidence levels,\nallows improved traceability of software artifacts and\nrelations.\n<P>\nThis requires that Bayesian network models of confidence\nlevels be constructed.  We describe how, given a system\nof interrelated software artifacts, an isomorphic Bayesian\nnetwork is constructed.  The structure and belief values\nin this network are later revised and refined as the\nnetwork is validated against project data and developer\njudgment.\n<P>\nFor validation, we studied the artifacts and relations\nof a system being developed at Beckman Instruments.\nBayesian networks were constructed to capture and confirm developers'\nconfidences in software artifacts and relationships.\nAn example scenario of confidence fluctuation was used\nto study developers' ability to trace and track artifacts\nand associated confidences with and without the Bayesian\ninformation.  The study showed that improvement in developer\nscores was, as hypothesized, achieved with statistical\nsignificance.\nAdditional contributions include a prototype implementation\nof a Java applet for software belief networks and a \ncollection of confidence factors that may influence\nlevels of developer confidence in software requirements.\n<P>\n <BR> <HR>\n<UL> \n<LI> <A NAME=\"tex2html3\" HREF=\"node1.html#SECTION00010000000000000000\">References</A>\n<LI> <A NAME=\"tex2html4\" HREF=\"node2.html#SECTION00020000000000000000\">  About this document ... </A>\n</UL>\n<HR><A NAME=\"tex2html1\" HREF=\"node1.html\"><IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"next\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/next_motif.gif\"></A> <IMG WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"up\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/up_motif_gr.gif\"> <IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"previous\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/previous_motif_gr.gif\">   <BR>\n<B> Next:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html2\" HREF=\"node1.html\">References</A>\n<P><ADDRESS>\n<I>Hadar Ziv <BR>\nFri Jun 20 16:27:13 PDT 1997</I>\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
