This maxim recognizes the abundance\nof software uncertainties and their relations and\nimpacts on process decisions and risk management.\nAlso, as corollary, it is suggested that software\ndevelopment include the search,\nidentification, modeling and management of software\nuncertainties.<LI>\n<EM>Defining an approach to explicitly model uncertainty\nusing software belief networks</EM>.  This approach\nis anchored in a Bayesian interpretation of relationships\nand dependencies among software artifacts.  It includes\nnotions of human judgment, confidence, belief, and evidence,\noften ignored by software modeling techniques.<LI>\n<EM>Implementing the SoftBayes Java applet</EM>.\nThis applet allows software systems to be defined\nas graphs of related artifacts and to be annotated\nwith uncertainty information.\nOnce defined, software belief networks are subject to\nBayesian updating, using a core engine such as provided\nby <EM>JavaBayes</EM>.<LI>\n<EM>Conducting a case study to substantiate the maxim above and\nto evaluate the applicability of Bayesian belief networks\nto a real software project</EM>.  Results of the CEquencer study\nindicate that explicit\nmodeling of software uncertainties improves developers'\nability to identify and track changes to levels of\nconfidence in software artifacts and relations.<LI>\n<EM>Finally, several confidence factors were identified\nas influencing expert's beliefs in software requirements</EM>.\nRecording those confidence factors is deemed beneficial\nto future similar projects where requirements uncertainty\nis captured explicitly.\n</UL>\n<P>\nSeveral impediments\nand limitations of our approach were observed, including\nthe initial cost of obtaining prior belief values, the\nneed to ensure that software belief networks retain\ncausality and variable independence, and the assumption\nthat software developers, domain experts, and related\nproject information are available and accessible.\n<P>\nOur experience in using Bayesian networks for software\nuncertainty modeling, specifically for the CEquencer\nsystem, indicates that:\n<UL><LI>\nThe conceptual view of both software systems and Bayesian networks\nas interrelated ``webs'' of nodes and links seems to offer a\nconvenient metaphor that also maps well into subsequent design\nand implementation.  Specifically, early depictions of CEquencer\nartifact webs were developed as Java applets and placed on the\nWorld Wide Web (see&nbsp;[<A HREF=\"node10.html#Zivapplets\">Ziv97</A>]);  these applets were\nthen viewed and reviewed by Beckman developers for accuracy\nand relevancy.<LI>\nThe CEquencer system, like most other software, proved to be\nfraught with uncertainties, thereby confirming our suspicions\nfor at least one real-life system.  Specifically, CEquencer\nsoftware embodies many, often subtle, problem domain\nuncertainties, including uncertainties stemming from\nlaws of physics and chemistry in the software's operational\nenvironment as well as from vaguely defined boundaries\nbetween software versus hardware components.<LI>\nOur notion of <EM>software uncertainties</EM> was\nwell received by Beckman developers, offering convenient\nmeans in which to describe their confidences and beliefs\nregarding CEquencer software.  The CEquencer requirements\nanalyst has recently incorporated confidence levels into\nher requirements capture process.<LI>\nThe questionnaire session at Beckman revealed that,\nfor the given set of questions, a significant\ndifference between the means of the subjects' scores was\nidentified.  This suggests that subjects' ability to\nanswer the questions increased with the addition of\nconfidence level information.  This confirms a\nstatistically significant relationship between the\navailability of confidence level information and\ndevelopers' ability to trace and track software\nartifacts and related confidences.\n</UL><HR><A NAME=\"tex2html40\" HREF=\"node3.html\"><IMG WIDTH=37 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"next\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/next_motif.gif\"></A> <A NAME=\"tex2html38\" HREF=\"node1.html\"><IMG WIDTH=26 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"up\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/up_motif.gif\"></A> <A NAME=\"tex2html32\" HREF=\"node1.html\"><IMG WIDTH=63 HEIGHT=24 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT=\"previous\" SRC=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/icons/previous_motif.gif\"></A>   <BR>\n<B> Next:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html41\" HREF=\"node3.html\">Future Work</A>\n<B>Up:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html39\" HREF=\"node1.html\">Conclusions and Future Work</A>\n<B> Previous:</B> <A NAME=\"tex2html33\" HREF=\"node1.html\">Conclusions and Future Work</A>\n<P><ADDRESS>\n<I>Hadar Ziv <BR>\nFri Jun 20 16:25:19 PDT 1997</I>\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
