Much of my work was done\nunder the auspices of the <A HREF=\"/pub/hyperware/\">Hyperware</a> project\nand collaborations with industry as part of the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.isr.uci.edu/\">Institute for Software Research</A>.\nMy research interests include\n<a href=\"/pub/websoft/\">global software engineering environments</a>,\nsoftware design, software architecture for network-based applications,\nand application-level protocol design.\n<A href=\"/~taylor/\">Richard N. Taylor</A> was my advisor and dissertation\ncommittee chair.\n\n<P>I have been actively involved in the World Wide Web project since\n1993.  I set up the original <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">UCI-ICS\nWWW server</A> and created several <a href=\"#packages\">WWW software\npackages</a>,\nand in early 1994 became involved in the effort to specify and improve the WWW\ninfrastructure through the <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/\">IETF</a> working\ngroups on <a href=\"/pub/ietf/uri/\">URI</a>, <a href=\"/pub/ietf/http/\">HTTP</a>,\nand <a href=\"/pub/ietf/html/\">HTML</a>\n(the set of protocols that were used to retrieve and view this document).\n\n<P>I also co-founded the <A href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\">Apache\nHTTP Server Project</A> and on the board of directors of\n<A href=\"http://www.apache.org/\">The Apache Software Foundation</a>.\nWe created the Apache HTTP server that currently dominates the general-purpose\nserver market with <a href=\"http://www.netcraft.com/survey/\">over 60% of\nthe public\nInternet websites</a> using our software.  Apache is my favorite example of\nthe power of global collaboration for the creation of software.\n\n<P>My dissertation,\n<em><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm\">Architectural Styles and\nthe Design of Network-based Software Architectures</a></em>, focused on\nthe rationale behind the design of the modern Web architecture and how it\ndiffers from other architectural styles.\n\n</TD>\n<TD ALIGN=\"Left\"  width=\"55%\" bgcolor=\"#FFFFCC\">\n\n<H2>Papers, Talks, and Specs</H2>\n\n<UL>\n<LI><a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/vita.html\">Curriculum Vitae and Publications</a>\n<LI><a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/talks/\">Presentations and Slides</a>\n<LI>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):<br>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt\">Generic\n    Syntax (RFC 2396)</A> and\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1808.txt\">Relative URL\n    (RFC 1808)</A>\n<LI>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):<br>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt\">\n    HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616</A>\n   [<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc2616.pdf\">pdf</A>, \n    <A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html\">html</A>], \n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2145.txt\">RFC 2145</A>, and\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2068.txt\">RFC 2068)</A> and\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/rfc1945.html\">HTTP/1.0 (RFC 1945)</A>\n<LI>Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF) Web-related Archives\n  <ul>\n  <li><a href=\"http://gbiv.com/protocols/uri/\">URI Working Group</A>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/\">HTTP Working Group</A>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/\">HTML Working Group</A>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/\">WebDAV Working Group</A>\n  </ul>\n</UL>\n\n<H2><a name=\"packages\">Open-Source Software</a></H2>\n\n<DL>\n<DT><B><A href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\">Apache</A></B>\n<DD>The best general-purpose HTTP server that money can't buy.\n\n<DT><B><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/websoft/libwww-ada95/\">libwww-ada95</A></B>\n<DD>A library of Ada95 packages that provides a start for a simple\n    programming interface to the World Wide Web.

According to most hypertext research,\nyou should have become bored by now and moved on to to another page.\nWell, this is for those who are extra curious (or just have nothing better\nto do).<P>\n\nMy background is a bit odd: I was conceived in \n<a href=\"http://nz.com/\">New Zealand</A> and born in\n<a href=\"http://www.laguna-beach.ca.us/\">South Laguna</A>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ca.gov/\">California</A>. \nAlthough most of my schooling has been in the U.S., I was taught how\nto read during a school term in \n<a href=\"http://nz.com/NZ/NZTour/Auckland/\">Auckland</A>.\nMy <a href=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/econ/personnel/fielding/fielding.html\">\nfather</a> is an emeritus professor in \n<a href=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/\">Social Sciences</a> here at UC Irvine,\nwhich is why I have been raised a Yank.  I was born in September 1965,\nduring the first week of classes of the year UCI was established, so you\nmight say that the two of us grew up together (except for the three years\nI spent studying Physics and International Politics at\n<a href=\"http://www.reed.edu/\">Reed College</a>).  I am part \n<a href=\"http://nz.com/NZ/Maori/MainPage.html\">Maori</A>,\n<a href=\"http://xenon.stanford.edu/~rsf/kiwi.html\">Kiwi</A>,\nYank, Irish, Scottish, British, and California beach bum.  Like I\nsaid, a bit odd.\n\n<P>\nMost of the rest can be seen in my <a href=\"http://roy.gbiv.com/vita.html\">vita</A>.\n\n<P>I was a Visiting Scholar at MIT/LCS during the summer of 1995, working with\nTim Berners-Lee and the <A href=\"http://www.w3.org/\">World Wide Web\nConsortium (W3C)</A>.  You can also see my\n<A href=\"http://www.w3.org/People/Fielding/\">W3C Home</A>.\n\n<P>\n<a href=\"http://www.techreview.com/tr100/profile.php3?Fielding\">I</a> was\nnamed by <a href=\"http://www.techreview.com/\">MIT Technology Review</a>\nas one of the\n<a href=\"http://www.techreview.com/tr100/\">TR100: The top 100 young innovators\nfor 1999</a>. <i>\"The 100 young visionaries who our editors and a distinguished\nPanel of Judges feel have the greatest potential for technological innovation\nin the 21st century.\"</i>  Gee, no pressure there.\n\n<P>The <a href=\"http://www.acm.org/\">Association of Computing Machinery</a>\nrecently awarded the <a href=\"http://www.acm.org/awards/ssaward.html\">1999\nACM Software System Award</a> to The Apache Group for the Apache HTTP Server.\nI talked a bit about that honor in\n<a href=\"http://lw.itworld.com/lw-2000-04/lw-04-apache.html\">an\ninterview with LinuxWorld</a>.\n\n<P>On a more local note, I was named by the UCI Alumni Association as the\nOutstanding Graduate Student of 2000.\n\n<H2>Other Interests</H2>\n\nI like playing games -- especially non-betting card games (Bridge,\nHearts, etc.) and obscure board games (british rails, naval war, etc.).\nI also like playing basketball, softball, football and going fishing.\nMind you, I haven't had time to do any of these things since I started\nmessing with the Web.\n\n<H2>Quotations</H2>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n      What is life?  It is the flash of a firefly in the night.\n      It is the breath of a buffalo in the wintertime.\n      It is the little shadow which runs across the grass\n      and loses itself in the sunset.<BR>\n\n      <i>--- Crowfoot's last words (1890), Blackfoot warrior and orator.</i>\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n<HR size=\"4\" width=\"50%\">\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\n      To most readers it will be easy, after reading this tale, to accept\n      Rover's theory that Man is set up deliberately as the antithesis of\n      everything the Dogs stand for, a sort of mythical straw-man, a\n      sociological fable.<P>\n\n      This is underlined by the recurring evidence of Man's aimlessness,\n      his constant running hither and yon, his grasping at a way of life\n      which constantly eludes him, possibly because he never knows exactly\n      what he wants.<BR>\n\n      <i>--- Clifford D.
