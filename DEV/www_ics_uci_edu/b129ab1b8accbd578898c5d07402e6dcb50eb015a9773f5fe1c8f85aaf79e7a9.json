Several people have been\nworking in Oxford to add new functionalities to the library. Moreover,\nleading researchers in computer vision were consulted as\n<a href=\"%pathto:about.advisors\">advisors</a> of the project. These\ncontributions will be made public in the next several weeks as the\ncode is tuned and finalised.</p>\n\n<p>A particularly significant contribution is the creation of a new\nsub-project, <b>VLBenchmakrs</b>, for the evaluation of feature\ndetectors and descriptors. <b>VLBenchmarks</b> is meant to provide a\nfuture-proof benchmarking suite. The first release includes\nreimplementations of standard feature benchmarks to replace ageing\nlegacy code and a brand new benchmark. In the future, it will be used\nto deliver to the community new, modern benchmarks in a consistent and\nsimple to use pacakge.</p>\n\n<h4>Version 0.9.17 (released)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Large scale Approximate Nearest Neighbours (ANN) K-means.</li>\n<li>Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).</li>\n<li>Fisher Kernel encoding.</li>\n<li>VLAD encoding.</li>\n<li>New SVM algorithms: SGD and SDCA with support for multiple loss\nfunctions, data weighting, and other useful features.</li>\n<li>LIOP feature descriptor.</li>\n<li>Multicore computations through OpenMP.</li>\n<li>New extensive image recognition examples running on several\nstandard computer vision benchmark datasets.</li>\n<li>Improved documentation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Version 0.9.16 (released)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><b>VLBenchmarks</b>: detector repeatability, descriptor matching\nscore, and image retrieval benchmarks.</li>\n<li>Affine covariant feature detectors.
