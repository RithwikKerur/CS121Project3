So will the faculty.  \nBut then, wherever two paths meet, some entrepreneur is likely to place a \ncoffee stand.  This new coffee stand will attract students, who will form \npaths from it to all campus buildings, etc.  Before long, your campus will \nbe all covered by paths, with no lawn left.  Or will it?  How can you lay \nout your campus so that all buildings are already directly connected by \npaths, without forming crossroads and encouraging coffee-stand builders?\n\n<P>We can express this problem using the notion of <I>dilation</I>.  \nThe dilation of a pair of vertices in an embedded planar graph is the \nratio between two kinds of distance: the length of the shortest path \nbetween them in the graph, and their geometric distance.  The dilation \nof the graph is the maximum dilation of any two of its vertices.  A graph \nhas dilation one if and only if there is a direct path between each pair \nof vertices.  Which graphs can have dilation one?\n\n<P>The pattern of solutions is common to many areas of mathematics: there \nare several infinite families of solutions, together with a few isolated \nspecial cases.  Actually, here there is exactly one special case.\nFirst, the infinite families.  Note that, if there are five or more \nvertices in the graph, some path must have two or more edges (there is no \nway to find a planar embedding of a five-vertex graph in which each vertex \nis connected to each other by a single edge).  Let P denote the path \nhaving the most vertices; then there are four infinite families:\n\n<P><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=500>\n<TR VALIGN=MIDDLE ALIGN=RIGHT>\n<TD>1.

Two vertices are on opposite sides of the line through P; the edge \nbetween them misses&nbsp;P:</TD>\n<TD><IMG SRC=\"y.gif\" WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=186 ALT=\"\"></TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE></CENTER>\n\n<P>However, there is one more case:\nthe graph can consist of a triangle nested inside another triangle, with \nthree two-edge paths formed by two inner vertices and one outer vertex.\n\n<P><CENTER><IMG SRC=\"v.gif\" WIDTH=327 HEIGHT=285 ALT=\"\"></CENTER>\n\n<P>The proof that these are the only possibilities is a straightforward \ncase analysis.  If there is at most one point on either side of P, the \ngraph is in one of the four infinite families.  Otherwise, there are some \ntwo points x and y on the same side of P.  If line xy passes through \nan endpoint of P, we can form a subset of the graph in which five points \nform a vee.  But then, four of the points form a crossroads from which we \ncan find a smaller vee, leading to an infinite regress.  If line xy misses \nany vertex of P, we can form a crossroads between x, y, and two points of P, \nagain forming a vee and an infinite regress.  So, the only remaining case \nis that P has only three points, and that line xy passes through the middle \npoint, forming a tee.  If this is not in one of our infinite families, \nthere must be a further point z on one side or the other of xy, and the \nsame analysis shows that z must be one endpoint of a line through an \nendpoint of P and the middle point of the path containing x and y.  These \npoints together form the irregular case above, and it is not hard to see \nthat any additional points would lead to an infinite regress.\n\n<P><HR><P>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"index.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
