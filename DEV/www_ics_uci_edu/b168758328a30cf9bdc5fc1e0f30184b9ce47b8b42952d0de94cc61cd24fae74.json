Deriving this winning\nstrategy, even for particular functions  F, is a very beautiful exercise.\n\nI have some references to work done on this game in the 1970's by Schwenk,\nFerguson, and someone else whose name escapes me right now (it was part of\nhis doctoral dissertation at UCLA).   In their papers, the winning strategy\nis derived.  What I would like to know is whether any work has been done\nsince then on characterizing the Nim-values (also called G-values, Grundy\nnumbers, or Sprague-Grundy numbers) for this class of games.  If you have\nknowledge of such, please post or contact me at the e-mail address below.\nThanks.\n\nTal Kubo\n<a href=\"mailto:kubo@math.harvard.edu\">kubo@math.harvard.edu</a>\n\np.s.  Conjecturally, winning strategies and other invariants of \ngeneralized Nim games are connected with the classification of \nsequences satisfying Conway's recurrence   a(n)=a(a(n-1))+a(n-a(n-1)).\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:jlame@math.ohio-state.edu\">jlame@math.ohio-state.edu</a> (John Lame)\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     sci.math.research\n<b>Subject:</b>        Take-Away Games\n<b>Date:</b>           16 Jul 1996 14:29:30 -0400\n<b>Organization:</b>   Department of Mathematics, The Ohio State University\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nHi everyone,\n\nFibonacci Nim has the following rules.\n\nA pile of N stones is placed between players 1 and 2 with N &gt; 1. \nPlayer 1 goes first and may remove as many stones as desired\nprovided at least one stone is left in the pile. Players then take\nturns removing 1 or more stones from the pile with the condition that:\nIf one player removes x stones, then the next player may remove at\nmost 2x stones.  The winner is the player who removes the last stone.\n\nIt turns out that player 2 has a guaranteed win if and only if\nN is a Fibonacci number (2,3,5,8,...).\n\nI was playing around with variations of this game and, in each\ncase, asking myself: For which initial pile sizes does player\n2 have a guaranteed win?  In particular I'm interested in the\nfollowing variation, the only change being the addition of\ncondition (2).\n\nA pile of N stones is placed between players 1 and 2 with N &gt; 1. \nPlayer 1 goes first and may remove as many stones as desired\nprovided at least one stone is left in the pile. Players then take\nturns removing 1 or more stones from the pile with two conditions.  \n1) If one player removes x stones, then the next player may remove at\nmost 2x stones.  \n2) Unless forced to, a player may not remove the same number of stones \nas they did on their last turn.\n\nNote that the only instance in which a player may be forced to violate\nrule (2) is in the case that there is a single stone remaining in the\npile.  The winner is the player who removes the last stone.\n\nI have found that the following are all the initial pile sizes &lt; 5000\nwhich guarantee a win for player 2.\n\n2 3 5 6 7 8 11 13 18 19 22 26 30 43 70 71 76 84 140 153 223 224 392 394\n405 681 689 696 1149 1164 1747 1759 1760 2893 2894 2895 4773\n\nI wrote a short program in C to generate various data related to this\ngame as well as play the game with the user. I'd be happy to mail it\nto anyone interested. (although its poorly documented so be warned)\n\nI'm posting this in the hopes that someone might be able to shed some\nlight on the nature of the above sequence.\n\nThere is a nice article on take-away games where the set of legal\nmoves on a given player's turn is a function of only the previous\nmove (as opposed to my variation in which the set of legal\nmoves on a given turn is a function of the previous two moves).\nThose interested should read \"Take-Away Games\" by Allen J. Schwenk,\nFibonacci Quarterly 8 (1970) 225-234.\n\nThanks in advance,\nJohn\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
