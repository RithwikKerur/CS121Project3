A minimum-redundancy code, on the\nother hand, is slower to decode then a flat code, but the compressed file\nsize is minimized.  This paper discusses the algorithm for constructing\nthe hybrid code which exhibits the simple structure of a flat\ncode and retains much of the compression effectiveness of a\nminimum-redundancy code.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
