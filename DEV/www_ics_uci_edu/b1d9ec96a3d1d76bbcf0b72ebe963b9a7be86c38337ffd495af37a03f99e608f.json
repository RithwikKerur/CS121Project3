Of coarse it does!  As I \nwas exploring the El Galaxy, I looked under leisure items and found \nAmateur Radio.  From there I ended up getting the low down on everything \nI could want to know about Ham operators.  First I decided to few the \ngeneral heading on <A HREF=\"http://www.acs.ncsu.edu:80/HamRadio\">Amateur \nRadio Information</a>.  This area is a good place to start. From there I \nwent to the Amateur Radio Callbook Server and then to MIT's North \nAmerican Call book server which led me to the area where I could <a \nHREF=\"http:://www.mit.edu:8001/callsign\">look up call signs</a>.  So \nnaturally I typed in mine first to see how it worked.  I pushed in N6YZZ \nand it pulled up my address, phone number and old call sign.  I checked \nand the rest of my family was in there too.  When I have more time I \nwill search into it more indebth.    \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>I am going to New York over spring break, can I find \nout what Broadway shows\n   will be playing while I am there?</B></A><br>\nI am leaving for Rodchester, New York for spring break in March.  My \nanswer starts with a story, I am \nsaving up money to hopefully go to a Broadway show while I am there.  I \ndidn't quite know where I should start so I started on my UCI homepage \nand went down and clicked on to the anchored World Wide Web that was in \npurple.  From there I went to the WWW -The Virtual Tourist which led me \nto a great map of the world that allows me to pick anything to see.  I \nclicked on City Net and on the next screen I was able to pick the region, \nbeing North America, then US, <A \nHREF=\"http://www.city.net/countries/united_states/\">New York</a> \nand then more specifically between \nRodchester and downtown.  The Reference Info. puts me right to everything \nI could possibly want to do.  Under Theatres, I found my list of \ntheatres and one said <A \nHREF=\"http://emall.com/ExploreNY/Broadway/Bway1.html\">Broadway the Great \nWhite Way</a>.   \nThis was only possible through many interesting stops along the \nway. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>Can I find out some history on my next quarters \nteachers in the area of Social\n   Sciences? </B></A><br>\nMy answer is...start with the home page because it relays \nyou to all the useful resources that UC Irvine has to offer.  To find out \nabout one's particular field of study I went to the Academic programming \nand research and all of the majors popped up on the screen.  I went \nstraight to Social Sciences where I had the choice of choosing between \ninformation on my specific department of study, graduate studies, info on \nparticular areas of study, links to many areas of the school as well as \nfaculty and staff information.  <A \nHREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/faculty.html\">Faculty</a> tells me briefly \nabout \nthe background or place of study for each individual professor in this \nfield.  As I understand it some profesors have chose to enter their \npicture, infromation about themselves and works, and it includes their \nEmail and school telephone number.  A good example of a neat profile is \nthat of <A \nHREF=\"http://www.socsci.uci.edu/cogsci/personnel/batchelder/batchelder.html\">William \nBatchelder</a>.  I could get lucky and find lots of info on \nmy next quarter teachers or Email them if I need to ask any questions. <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>Can I find out more about what classes I need to minor in Spanish which is in\n   the school of Humanities?</B></A><br>\nMy answer is...start at home again.  The <a \nHREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/academic_programs.html\">Academic Programs and \nResearch</a> is the key area to be at for informations relating to \ninformation on majors or \nminors.  Going to Humanities then sends me to a gopher menu where I \nchoose to look at the <A \nHREF=\"gopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/new.cat/hum/spanish\">Spanish \nand Portuguese</a> department.  Once the text \ncomes up it doesn't look that exciting but the key point is that in the \nhumanities one does not know who the staff is or their backgrounds in \nthe lower devision areas.  In the higher levels there are descriptions \nabout the classes to take, requirements needed, visting profesors and \nmany of the politics.  It basically is an updated version of the UCI \ncatalog of background with extra add ons.<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>I would like to know if there is a way \nthat I can find a list of servers, and if so is there one in \nMexico at the UNAM where my best friend is going to study next \nyear?</B></A><br>\nMy answer is...Yes there is!  First place I started was under Navigate \nand starting points and then to Web Overview with led me to Places to \nstart exploring.  Next thing I knew there was a <A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/htypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html\">lists of \nServers</a> from around the world.  I naturally clicked to Latin America, \nMexico and then UNAM the University in which she will be studying.  <a \nHREF=\"gopher://noc.noc.unam.mx/oo/este_goph\">UNAM</a> is a very popular \nUniversity in Mexico and what the server does is hooks me up to a gopher \nthat tells me about the school.  Although this is were I do have to bring \nmy Spanish skills into action.  I am excited to have found this.  Mosaic, \nknown as a browser or server pulls up many wonderful things that I can \nexplore. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 13, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
