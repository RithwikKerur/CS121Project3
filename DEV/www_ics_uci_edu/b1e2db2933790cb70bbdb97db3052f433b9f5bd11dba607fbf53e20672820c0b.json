Included in this paper is information \npertaining to the\n<A HREF=\"#Teachers\"> TEACHER</A> who is interested in better \nexploring the Web and the idea of using it within the classroom as an \nadditional teaching tool.  Also included are sites throughout the Web\nthat\n<A HREF=\"#par\">PARENTS</A> can utilize at home to better educate \nthemselves on how they can interact with their children and the education \nprocess. Also given are sites that would be fun to peruse with children.\n A section on what\n<A HREF=\"#kid\">KIDS</A> \ncan do on the Web has also been included. Everything from sports \ninformation to actual games that can be played.  The goal is to create a \nresource that can be used by educators, parents and children.\n\n<!--------===========CUT===HERE=========-------------->\n<hr>\n<H4> <A NAME=\"Teachers\"> Teachers </A> </H4>\nTeachers, where do you begin?\n  Many educators have yet to explore the world of<A \nHREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org:90/dic.html\">\n Cyberspace</A>. This world of Cyberspace can seem confusing. Many<A \nHREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org:90/stories.menu.html\">\n questions and \ndoubts</A> may arise to a teacher who is\nconsidering using a computer as another teaching tool within the classroom:\n<OL> \n<LI>What is the <A HREF=\"#History\">history of the internet</A>?\n<LI>What are some internet<A HREF=\"#resources>resources</A> for educators?\n<LI>What are some <A HREF=\"#Activities\">interactive classroom activities</A> \nthat involve the computer? </OL>\nThese questions and more will be explored in the next few pages.\n\n\n<P>\n\n<H5> <A NAME=\"History\"> <B> History of the Internet </B> </A>  </H5> \n\nThe Internet\nor information highway was born in 1969 although\n it had been thought over theoretically for over 25 years.  \nIt was instigated by the U.S. Department of Defense as a way \nfor computers at distant locations to \"talk\" with each other.  \nThis communication was to be used to transfer military and\nnational security data. Well, today it has developed into much\nmore. It is now a source that can be used by people all over the world to transfer data and exchange information.\n\n<P>\n<H6>\n<B> <A NAME=\"Resources\">Educational Resources for Educators</A></B>  \n</H6> There are some good resources on the Web that a beginner may access.\nThere is an educational Web server called\n<A HREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/\">\nWeb 66</A> that contains among it's many \neducational goals, the goal of helping educators of grades K-12 learn\nhow to set up their own Internet servers. The Web 66 Classroom <A\nHREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/contents.html\">\n\nInternet Server\nCookbook</A>may be a helpful tool for the beginner Webber. It contains\ninformation on adding pictures and sound to the page that you create.\nIt also includes information on how to mail share and creating your own\nmailing list. In it's \n<A HREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/Kitchen.html\"> Server Kitchen</A>\nyou are\nable to find all the basic information on beginning an educational\nconnection to the Web. Also helpful is the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.batnet.com/ape/machttp_talk/machttpservers.by.mac.html\">\nHome Page of Macintosh</A>, you can learn all about their\nvarious servers.  There are also links to other home pages where you can\nfind out more about different types of computers.  Please note, however,\nthat not all of your technical problems and questions can be found answered\non the Web for you.\nMany technical questions may need to be addressed to someone that you can\ntalk\nto directly.  \n\n<P>\n\nThere are many resources on the Web that are available for teachers.\nOne such source that was previously mentioned was <A\nHREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/\"> Web 66</A>. Web not only contains\ninformative computer server information, but it also contains links to\neducational documents all over the Web. Web 66 includes a What's New\npage and even a <A HREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/schools.html\">\nregistry</A> of all the K-12 schools on the Web.  This can be useful\nbecause a teacher can look into how other classrooms and schools are\nusing the Web. Another example of Web resources is\n<A HREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org/janice_k12/k12menu.html\"> Janice's\nOUTPOST</A>.  Her K-12 Cyberspace OUTPOST contains group of very\nhelpful educational <A HREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org/janice_k12/vl.html\">\nvirtual libraries</A> on the Web. One interesting and informative link\nis called the <A HREF=\"http://eryx.syr.edu/COWSHome.html\"> AskERIC\nVirtual Library</A>. This Library contains everything from a complete 6\nweek lesson plan outline on\n<A HREF=\"gopher://ericir.syr.edu/00/Lesson/Astronomy/Introduction\">\nAstrology</A>to great listed\n resources on mainstreaming gifted students.\n\n<P>\n\nAn informative source for teachers would be the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cortland.edu/www_root/flteach/flteach.html\">\nFLTeach</A> page.  \n\nThis page \nsupplies different information on foreign language teaching \nmethods for high school and college educators.\nA very informative site and good starting point for a\nforeign language educator would be \nthe<A HREF=\"http://www.itp.berkeley.edu/~thorne/HumanResources.html\">\nWorld Wide Web page of Foreign Language Resources</A>.  This site \nincludes links all over the United States and \nthe world. It contains information on many different foreign\n languages, from Hebrew to Chinese.\n\n<P>\n\nOne interesting and informative Web page is \nthat of the<A HREF=\"http://www.scri.fsu.edu/~dennisl/CMS.html\">\nCyberspace Middle \nSchool</A>.\n\nOn this page you can find helpful information on Web magazines and a\nspecial search engine on the web just for educators, called<A\nHREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/cisco/edu-arch.html\"> CEARCH</A> in the\nCisco Educational Archive..  Now if you are looking for state of the\nart development for education through computers the Web has information\navailable on that, also.  One study called Computer as<A\nHREF=\"http://clp.berkeley.edu/CLP.html\"> Learning Partner\nProject</A>(CLP) is actually founded by the National Science\nFoundation.\n\nThis project, directed by Dr. Marcia Linn of Berkeley's Graduate School of\nEducation. attempts to help students with the conceptual complexities of\nunderstanding science.  This project uses the computer to assist in\ninstruction.  CLP has become a complete physical science course being\noffered at Foothill Middle School in Walnut Creek, CA.  RAND (Research and\nDevelopment) is a non-profit institute that that has seen the need for\ncomputer teaching tools.  A system by the name of ARC/INFO ESSCOTS created\nwith the help of the<A HREF=\"http://www.rand.org/\"> RAND</A> corporation,\nallows junior high and high school students to propose statistical theories\nand then examine them with easy-to-use graphical interfaces.\n\n<P>\n\n Another project allows high school students to exchange text, data,\naudio and video with other users.  This is the\n<A\nHREF=\"http://www.covis.nwu.edu/\"> Learning through Collaborative\nVisualization Project</A>(CoVis) supported by Ameritech and Bellcore\ncompanies.  This educational network uses a standard of computing\nusually only accesible to commercial networking.  \n\n<P>\n<H7> <B> <A NAME=\"#Activities\">Interactive Classroom Activities</A> </B>  \n</H7><P>\nNothing can\ncompletely replace the hands-on traditional experiences that a\nclassroom and teacher are able to provide.\n With the computer and the communication attributes thereof, one can\ncommunicate with other classrooms throughout the state and throughout\nthe world.\n\n\n<P>\n\nTeachers are now able to have contact with other teachers and exchange\ninnovative educational ideas, while students are capable of communicating\nwith other students all over the world.  By this communication they can\npeer edit assignments or cultivate friendships.    The\n<A\nHREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org:90/ibahn.int4.html\"> Internet</A> gives the\nmodern educator a new classroom tool.  This tool can become an educational\nwindow to other cultures around the world.  For example at \n<A\nHREF=\"http://www.ncook.k12.il.us/sp/sp_home_page.html\"> John H. Springman\nSchool</A> a teacher or school administrator can explore the teaching and\nmotivational philosophy of another school without actually visiting the\ncampus.  Students can talk to other students at the school and teachers can\nalso communicate and exchange ideas. On\n<A\nHREF=\"http://www.umich.edu/~sstrat/BestK12.html\">\n Steve Stratford's home page</A> you and your students can look at schools\nand their computer projects from around the world.  One can even look at a\nclassroom in Germany, view their class picture and be accessible to each\nstudents very own home page.  St. Olaf College in Minnesota helps out with\nthe \n<A HREF=\"http://www.stolaf.edu/network/iecc/#subscribe\"> Intercultural\nE-Mail Classroom Connections</A> program.  A teacher can link themselves\nand their classes to other classes in different countries, thereby exposing\ntheir classes to other cultures.  One interesting site includes an \ninteractive on-line discussion on <A \nHREF=\"http://ericir.syr.edu/Discovery/Promise/Welcome/welcomepage2.html\">\nAfroAmerican</A> \nmigration form the Southern\nStates of the U.S., to Chicago from 1942 through 1970.  Interactive sites \nsuch as this one would greatly augment a unit on AfroAmerican History.  \nAnother site would tie in well with a unit on war. This page includes <A \nHREF=\"http://www.umich.edu/~sstrat/BestK12.html\"> \nhistorical war stories</A> along with professional exhibits and pictures and \nmemories from veterans.\n\n\n\n<H5>\n<a name=\"par\"><b>Educational Uses for Parents</b></a></H5>\n\nParents as well as teachers are able to use the Internet to educate their\nchildren.  The Internet can accommodate all ages of children in a variety\nof different subjects.  A good place for parents to begin looking would\nbe in the <A HREF=\"\nhttp://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/fastindex.html\">\nKids Web</a> which is a World Wide Web Digital Library for\nSchoolkids.  In this directory one can choose from a multiplicity of\nsubjects to engage their children.\n\n\n\n<P>\nThis particular Kids Web has many subject headings in the area of <A\nHREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/art.html\">art.</a>  As\nwell there are a vast majority of sciences that have to do with the <a\nHREF=\"\nhttp://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/environment.html\">environment,</a>\n<a\nHREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/physics.html\">physics,</a>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/weather.html\">\nweather,</a> <a\nHREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/biology.html\">biology</a>\nand the educational list continues.\nThis Kids Web also has directories pertaining to  Social Studies\nand Miscellaneous themes.  Each one of these documents link to other\ncomputers and documents that provides a vast array of incredible\ninformation to\nteach children.  This is why the Internet is called a web, the resource of\nknowledge is never ending. <p>\n<P>\n<b>Simple Exploration</b>\n<p>\n   \n\nA good way to start\nis just simple exploration.  For example under the arts, <A\nHREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org/janice_k12/artsedge/artsedge.html\">(ArtsEdge)</a>\nthere are amazing pictures.  A child is\nable to take a tour of the famous Louvre art gallery in Paris just by\nsitting down at their computer. <a\nHREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/drama.html\">\n Dramas</a> can also be shown on the screen (although\nthis could take a long time to load onto one's computer depending on the\ntype of computer and it's speed).  The subject of sciences can take a\nchild through museums and show them pictures of <A\nHREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/dinosaurs.html\">dinosaurs.</a>\nPictures of dinosaurs are only a few of the great online images available to\nsee, as well there are many types of birds, reptiles, amphibians,\ninsects or mammals to find.  In the area of social studies, children are\nable\nto look into information about our <a\nHREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/government.html\">government</a>\nand the different branches that exist in\nour judical system.  One's interest is continuously spurred when exploring\nthe Internet.  The Internet is a learning\nexperience for both the parent and the child.\n   \n<p>\nThe Internet also allows for parents to look into the methodology that other\nmodel school\ndistricts use. From on-line examples, parents can get a good feel  \nfor how others are choosing to educate their children.  A nice\nexample of this would be <A HREF=\"http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/>Princeton \nRegional Schools</a>.  This\nschool district has general information regarding the Internet.  If one\ndecides to explore this particular district, they will find the school's <a\nHREF=\"http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/subjects/techmission.html\">technology\nMission Statement</a>, about their newspaper, board policies, manuals and\na basic overall general <A\nHREF=\"http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/Subjects/PHS_Profile.html>profile</a> of\nthe school.  This could be a very\nbeneficial way to learn about other schools and how parent involvement in\nthe schools could lead to the furthering of the education of our\nchildren.\n<p>\n   \n<B>New Software</B>   \n\n<P>\nThere is more related software that parents have been\nsearching into for their children.  The Princeton school district K-12's \nhome page refers to a lot of the software now being offered.  The WWW has\nmany different web\nviewers and to accommodate them all, it needs to keep up on the new\nsoftware.  For example there is <A\nHREF=\"http://home.mcom.com/MCOM/products_docs/index.html\">Netscape</a>\nwhich is able to show graphics, <a\nHREF=\"file://www.prs.k12.nj.us/pub/Current\nMosaic Client/Helper Apps/Sparkle.hqx\">Sparkle</a> which is able to \nshow   \nmovies\nonline, <A HREF=\"file://www.prs.k12.nj.us/pub/Current Mosaic\nClient/Helper Apps/SoundMachine.hqx\">SoundMachine</a> and many others.\n(Sparkle and SoundMachine can only be accessed with appropriate\nequipment.)  All these extras are fun to\nhave and the functions  they contribute are amazing to watch on the\ncomputer because the computer just seems to come to life.\n\n\n<p>\nMore information on <a\nHREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/fastindex.html\">Other\nDigital Libraries</a> that have:\n<ol>\n1. <a HREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/others.html\">Other\nCollections of Web Sites for Kids</a><BR>\n2. <a Href=\"http://hillside.coled.umn.edu/others.html\">List of K-12   \n Schools on the Internet</a><BR>\n3. <a HREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/contents.html\">Classroom\nInternet Server Cookbook</a><br>\n</ol>\nAlso look into <a\nHREf=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/whats-new.html\">What's\nNew with Kids Web.</a>\n\n<!------------===========CUT HERE=============----------------->   \n\n<H6><a NAME=\"kid\"><B>Educational Uses for Children</b></a></H6>\n   \n<p>\n\nComputers are part of the future and children need to be familiar with\ncomputers in this day and age.  Whether or not a child is playing games\nor finding new and exciting web find, they are familiarizing themselves  \nwith the computer and it's many functions.\n<p>\n<b>Places for Kids to Start</B>\n<p>\nA fantastic directory with endless topics and links for children is <a\nHREF=\"http://gagme.wwa.com/~boba/kids.html#skip\">Uncle Bob's Kids'\nPage</a>. \"This page is a treasure chest of links, which\nhave been cleaned, checked, and annotated, with spotlights on special\nsubject.\"  This is the introduction to Uncle Bob's Page that Bob Allison\n(boba@wwa.com) created.  Within this directory there are spotlights on \nouter\nspace,\nthe grand canyon national park, Star Trek, pictures, upcoming, current\nand recent events, Disney, NASA and much much more because these\nhighlights don't even scratch the surface of what there is to find.\n\n\n<p>\nThere are many games to find in Uncle Bob's Page, but there are also many\nother places to look.  <a\nHREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/fun.html\">Fun and\nGames</a> in another particular directory contains <a\nHref=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Comics/\">comics</a>\nand many different varieties.  <a\nHREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Games/\">Games</a>\nalso seem to be unlimited on the Internet.

Kids can be glued to the screen\nfor hours once they find this directory.\n<p>\n<b>Sports</b>\n<p>\n\n\nAnother area that kids usually enjoy is the area of sports.  <A\nHREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Entertainment/Sports/\">The Yahoo\nSports Page</a> is a fantastic place to start.  There is about 100\ndifferent sports that can be looked into.  Any of these sports will lead \nto a homepage where more can be researched or current news can be looked\nup.  It contains sports from croquet, korfball, sumo, martial arts to\nsnow boarding.  It appears to be the \"most comprehensive listing of\nsports information available on the Internet.\" (Paul Coddington,\npaulc@npac.syr.edu)\n\n\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.clark.net/pub/journalism/kid.html\">KID</a> which   \nstands for \"Kids Internet Delight\" is one more site that children might  \nreally enjoy.  This directory is basically an index of an array of different\ninformation for children to search.  Learning can be fun on a computer\nbut there are also many areas that children can explore that may not be\nsomething that parent feel suitable for their children to view.  With young\nchildren it is\nrecommended that parents monitor and help their child while exploring the\nweb.  Searching the web is definitely an educational experience for\nchildren regardless of their age and the familiarity with a computer will\nbe helpful to them in the future.\n\n\n<!----------------============Cut HERE===========----------->\n\n<p>\n<H7><A=Name\"conclusion\"><b>Conclusion</b></a></H7>\n<p>\nExploring the Internet leads to many educational finds.
