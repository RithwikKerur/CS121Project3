In this assignment, we are \ngoing to focus on three regions in particular: \n<a href=\"http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/Jordan.GIF\">Jordan</a>,<a \nhref=\"http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/Israel.GIF\">Israel</a>, and Palestine.  The problem with \nattributing a geographical location to a &quot;Palestinian&quot; state is \nthat there is officially not such a state in existence          \n(yet). Instead, Palestinians live on a majority of the land in <a \nhref=\"http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/GazaStrip91.jpg\">the Gaza Strip</a> and <a \nhref=\"http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/WestBank.jpg\">the West Bank</a> of the Jordan River.  In \nparticular, we will pay special notice to some of the important \npolitical and economic aspects of each country/region, with a special \nfocus on the regions' constitutions, modern historical conflict, \nprospects for peace, and economics.  Although \nreligion obviously plays <b>some</b> role in the conflict, we have chosen to \nzero in on the purely political and economic concerns of the region.</p> \n<p><a href=\"#table\">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"landscapes\">The Political Landscapes of Jordan, Israel, and the \nPalestinians</a></h2> <p>\n<h4>Jordan and the Constitution</h4>\nJordan, or <a href=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/\">The Hashemite Kingdom of \nJordan</a> (named after the Hashemite ruling family) has a <a \nhref=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/index.html\">Constitution</a> \nwhich, among other things, serves as the &quot;framework&quot; for the \nstate.  In particular, Jordan's constitution contains nine components.  \nLike the American constitution, Jordan's constitution contains provisions \nfor an <a href=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/chap4.html\">executive \npower</a> (which discusses the process by which the monarchy \nproceeds), the <a \nhref=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/chap5.html\">national assembly</a> \n(comprised of both a senate and chamber of deputies), and the <a \nhref=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/chap6.html\">judiciary</a> (which, \ninterestingly enough, is divided into courts that deal specifically with \ncivil, religious, and special matters).  In addition, Jordan's \nconstitution provides for certain <a \nhref=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/const/chap2.html\">duties and freedoms of \nJordan's citizens</a>.  Such freedoms include land rights, personal \nfreedoms, and labor law.\n\n<h4>Israel's Political Structure</h4>\n\n<a href=\"gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st2\">Israel's \nPolitical Structure</a> parallels that found in many European countries \n(because it is based on a parliamentary system).  It is comprised of \nthree main branches, the <a \nhref=\"gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st5\">Israeli Legislature \n(a.k.a., the Knesset)</a>, the <a \nhref=\"gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st6\"> Israeli Executive \nBranch</a>, and the <a \nhref=\"gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st7\">Israeli \nJudiciary</a>.  Israel does not have an official \"constitution\" per se, \nbut <b>does</b> have a number of <i>Basic Laws</i> adopted by the Knesset \nthat seem to serve a similar purpose.  The Basic Laws represent the <a \nhref=\"gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/facts/state/st8\">Law of the Land in \nIsrael</a>.  In particular, the basic laws have helped <i>establish</i> \nthe Knesset, the President, the Government, the State Economy, the Israel \nDefense Forces (a.k.a. &quot;the IDF&quot;), the Judiciary, and the \noffice of the State Comptroller.  In addition, the Basic Laws have \nincluded special measures on state lands, the city of Jerusalem, Human \nDignity and Liberty, and Freedom of Occupation.\n\n<h4>The Political Structure of the Palestinian People</h4>\n\nAs stated earlier on, the Palestinian people are not in possession of an \nofficial constitution as of yet, mostly because there is no \n&quot;official&quot; Palestinian state.  However, Palestinians have \nconsidered themselves a distinct people whose homeland was taken \nfrom them.  As a result, Palestinians <b>have</b> produced numerous \ndocuments that serve as a means of establishing both a national identity \nand a means of self-governance (even under occupation).  For example, \nthe Palestinians have legitimized much of their struggle on <a \nhref=\"gopher://alquds.org/00/newarticles/The%20Palestinian%20Right%20of%20Return\">the Palestinian Right of Return</a>.  The Right of Return is based on, in large part, to the document that comes closest to a \nPalestinian constitution--<a href=\"gopher://israel-info.gov.il/00/basic/680717.gui\">the Palestinian National Charter</a>.\n  The Charter was created between July 1-17, 1968, and\n comprises thirty-three articles.  Each article defined what a \n&quot;Palestinian&quot; was (when the document was first created\n\n\n\n\n), as well as providing the rationale for their claim to the land.  \nHowever, parts of the charter <b>have</b> been altered as a result of the \n1993 peace agreement with Israel--paving the \nway for a future Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza.\n<p><a href=\"#table\">Return to Table of Contents</a>\n<h2><a name=\"overview\">An Overview-The History of The Arab-Israeli \nConflict</a></h2>\n\n<p>After years of war following its\n <a  \nhref=\"gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5a\">independence</a>,\n Israel has come to partial terms with Jordan and the Palestinians. \n Before we go into the current peace agreements, however, it's important\n to put the conflict between the three sides into context.</p>\n \n<p> Following its inception, Israel was involved in the \n<a href=\"gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5c\">1956\n Sinai War</a>. Israel, in its own view, felt that it was being threatened by\n the nations of <a \nhref=\"ftp://ftp.cs.sunysb.edu/pub/EN/www/home.html\">Egypt</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/230.html\">Syria</a>, \nand Jordan (all three of which had formed a \nmilitary alliance).   The debate over whether Israel <i>actually</i> was  \nthreatened has been a matter of debate. Nevertheless, it carried out an \nattack against Egypt's Sinai Peninsula (along with France and Great \nBritain).  After much coaxing from the United States, Israel agreed to \nwithdraw its troops and turn over the Suez Canal.</p>\n\n<p>  The second main war \nIsrael was involved in is also a point of controversy, depending on which \nside you talk to.  <a \nhref=\"gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5e\">Israel's \nView of the 6-Day War</a> is that it was justified in launching an attack \non Egypt, Syria, and Jordan once again because it felt these countries \nwere massing troops for an offensive attack of their own.  The <a \nhref=\"gopher://alquds.org/00/introduction/The%201967%20War\">Arab \nView of the 1967 War</a> claims that Israel was the instigator.  Egypt, \nSyria, and Jordan say Israel knew full well that the Arabs had no \nintention of attacking.  Whatever one's view, Israel ended up destroying \nmuch of the air and land forces of the opposing countries.  As a result \nof the 1967 War, Israel captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from \nEgypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank of the Jordan \nRiver from Jordan.  It was after the war that the <a \nhref=\"http://www.adfa.oz.au/CS/flg/col/il-plo.html\">Palestine Liberation \nOrganization</a> was formed.  In Israel's eyes, the PLO was a terrorist \ngroup bent on destruction.  However, the PLO (and most of the Arab \nworld, for that matter) viewed itself as conducting a legitimate \nstruggle to free the Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip \nfrom Israeli occupation.  </p>\n\n<p>The next conflict between Israel and these \ncountries was <a \nhref=\"gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5f\">the \n1973 Yom Kippur War</a>.  This conflict began when both Egypt and Syria \n(Jordan was not involved) launched an attack on Israel.  Only with \nmilitary aid from the United States was Israel able to repel the \nattack.  Shortly after, the sides signed an agreement, in which Israel \nwithdrew from parts of the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights.</p>\n\n<p>  The \nlast major war Israel was involved in was code-named <a \nhref=\"gopher://israel-info.nysernet.org/00/facts/history/state/h5h\">\nOperation Peace for Galilee</a>.  This 1982 conflict resulted after \nthe PLO was forced to move its headquarters into the south part of <a \nhref=\"http://www.ic.gov/94fact/country/138.html\">Lebanon</a>.  The PLO \ncontinuously launched attacks \ninto Israel, and Israel responded by attacking back.  However, Israel's \nattack proved to be devastating in loss of life for the PLO, \nPalestinian refugees, Lebanese civilians, and the Israeli military \nitself.  To this day, Israel maintains a \"security zone\" in the south \npart of Lebanon (which encompasses about ten percent of the country's \ntotal land area).</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">Return to Table of Contents</a>\n<h2><a name=\"chance\">A Chance for Peace?</h2></a>\n\n<p>Following the <a \nhref=\"http://www2.msstate.edu/~rah2/gulf-war.html\">\n1991 Persian Gulf War</a>, the United States \nand the former Soviet Union pressured Israel, Jordan, Syria, and the \nPalestinians to the bargaining table to negotiate a final peace \nsettlement.  Following the 1992 Israeli elections, a more moderate \ngovernment under Yitzhak Rabin came into power.  In the summer of 1993, \na major breakthrough occurred.  Israel and the Palestinians agreed, for \nthe first time on both sides, to recognize each other. This <a href=\n\"http://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/basic@930909.gui/palestine \n1993\">Israel-PLO recognition</a> resulted in a Declaration of Principles \n(which was signed on the White House Lawn).  In addition to the \nrecognition, Israel agreed to give Palestinians the power of self-rule in \nGaza and the West Bank town of Jericho (with Israeli troop removal from \nthese \nimmediate areas and the remainder of the West Bank in the future).</p>\n  \n<p>Following this treaty, Jordan and Israel experienced a breakthrough in \n<i>their</i> negotiations.  They ended up signing a treaty of their own.  \n<a href=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/treaty-index.html\">The 1994 \nJordan-Israel Peace Treaty</a> contains thirty articles, with  provisions \non (among other things)<a \nhref=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/treaty.html#article6\">water</a>, <a href=\n\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/treaty.html#article7\">economic relations</a>, \nand <a \nhref=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/treaty1.html#article19\">energy</a>.  \nThis treaty was also signed at the White House, and officially ended \nforty-six years \nof war between the two sides.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"future\">The Future of Peace</a></h2>\n<p>What the future holds for these three parties is somewhat \nuncertain.  The Israel-Jordan agreement, in our own view, will \nremain in place (<b>as long as</b> both governments remain \nstable).  The Palestinian-Israeli agreement, however, might be \nin jeopardy.  Many (but not most) Jews and Arabs remain against \nthe peace process, including the group <a \nhref=\"gopher://alquds.org/11/politics/org/hamas/truth\">HAMAS</a>. \nA big sticking point for the next few years is the status of \nIsrael's capital of <a \nhref=\"http://www1.huji.ac.il/jeru/prespective.jpg\">Jerusalem</a>. Both \nPalestinians and Israelis claim the city as their own.  The fact remains, \nhowever, that Palestinians live in the East sector of the city, while \nIsraelis live in the West sector of the city.  Palestinians want the East \nto become the eventual capital of a Palestinian state, but Israel does \nnot want to see the city divided.  To give a background on <b>how</b> \ndivided the city has been through the years, you can look at <a \nhref=\"http://www1.huji.ac.il/jeru/timetable.html\">the \nhistory of Jerusalem</a>.  The city began \nbetween the years 1000 and 961 B.C., when King David reigned.  Since then, \nthe city has gone through the conquest of the Persian Empire, the \nHasmoneans (or the Maccabees), the Romans, the Byzantines, the Muslims, \nthe European crusaders, the Mamelukes, the Ottomans, the British, and \nIsrael today.  Even in our present time, Jerusalem is considered \nholy to \nthree religions (Islam, Judaism, and Christianity).</p>  \n\n<p>  The next main issue that has concerned both sides is the rate of \nIsraeli troop withdrawl from the rest of the West Bank.  Palestinians \nwant to see a faster troop withdrawl, whereas Israel contends the troops \nwill stay until the PLO can stop terrorist attacks.  A related issue is \nthe demand that Israel re-instate <a \nhref=\"gopher://alquds.org/00/history/palestine1967/Expulsions%20of%20Palestinians%20from%20West-Bank%20and%20Gaza-Strip\">Palestinians expelled from the West Bank and Gaza Strip</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A third sticking point is the question over <a \nhref=\"gopher://alquds.org/00/politics/iwra\">water rights</a>.  For \nwhatever reason, this issue was not included in the Declaration of \nPrinciples.  Some, like Dr. Nabil M. El-Khodary believe the \nomission of the water issue was a political move by Israel and was \ntherefore intentional.  Again, as with many issues in the Middle \nEast, everyone involved has their opinion.  No matter how one \nslices it, though, it <b>will</b> remain contentious until a \npossible settlement.\n<p><a href=\"#table\">Return to Table of Contents</a></p>\n<h2><a name=\"economy\">The \nEconomies of Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinians</a></h2>\n\nAs we have seen, certain parts of the peace treaties \nbetween Jordan, Israel, and \nthe Palestinians are dependent upon healthy economic relations.  In this \nsection of the assignment, we'll describe what the economic picture of \neach area looks like--how wealthy (or how poor) the country/area is, \nwhat each area is dependent upon for economic sustainability, and other \nrelated statistics.   \n\n<H4>Jordan</H4>\n<p> <A\nHREF=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/cia.html#Economy \n\">Jordan's \neconomy</A> is very dependent on the economic health of the other \ncountries. In particular, Jordan relies on financial support from the \nGulf States' oil rich monarchies.(lsaid@netcom.com)  The \"<A \nHREF=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/cia.html#Geography \"> \nphysical resource bases of Jordan</A> are extremely limited, \nwhich precludes any substantial development of primary economic activity(even\n if the constraints imposed by the size of their domestic markets \ncould be overcome.\"(lsaid@netcom.com)  We believe that Jordan has relied \nmore on its  <A\nHREF=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/cia.html#People \n\">human \nresources</A> (which are plentiful) rather than its physical ones.    \n</p>\n <H4>The Palestinians</H4>\n<p><A \nHREF=\"http://http1.brunel.ac.uk:8080/~em93mma/PALESTINE/information.html\"> \nPalestine</A> (i.e., the land commonly known as the West Bank and Gaza \nStrip) is primarily used for agricultural purposes. It contains \"<A HREF=\" \nhttp://http2.brunel.ac.uk:8080/~em93mma/GIFS2/Cities/\">10,162 square \nmile(27,000 square kilometres) of land plus 272 square miles of inland \nwater</A>.\"(Mohammed Abu Sharikh)  According to Mr. Mohammed Abu Sharikh, \nthe human resource base of the Palestinian population is estimated to be \n6,409,036.  The Palestinian people are <i>dependent</i> on agriculture.  \nBecause of the Mediterranean climate, they can grow a wide \nassortment of crops year-round.  These crops are, in turn, sent out to \nEurope and other Gulf countries.</p> \n<H4>Israel</H4> <p> \n</p>Only one economy in the<A \nHREF=\"http://www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Map_collection/middle_east_and_asia/Israel.GIF\"> \nMiddle East</A> can really be compared to those found in Europe--that of \n <A HREF=\"http://www.israel.org/\">Israel</A>.  Living \nstandards are high, and compare favorably with <A HREF=\" \nhttp://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/facts@israel@an2b/economic\">European \nlevels.</A> \"The country boasts a highly diversified <A \nHREF=\"http://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/facts@econ@ec1\">economy</A>\nIt not only produces <A HREF=\"  \nhttp://www.israel.org/israel-info/display.cgi/facts@econ@ec7/economic\">goods for immediate consumption,</A> but also uses components in local assembly industries and... \nmachinery.\"(Yigal Caspi). The growth of Israel's economy is very high \ncompared to other nations in the Middle East.  \"Between 1948 and 1958 \nhigh immigration accelerated development in order to \nachieve a reasonable standard of living.  Then from 1960 to 1972 annual \ngrowth was 9.2%.\"(Yigal Caspi)  Israel's economy does not depend upon \nagriculture or industry; however, they are shifting to a \n<i>high-tech</i> industrial economy.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#table\">Return to Table of Contents</a>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</a></h2>\n<p>So concludes our presentation on the areas of Jordan, Israel, and \nPalestine.  The constitutional/governmental structures of each place have \nespecially been points of interest (to us, at least).  In addition, they \ndemonstrate \n<i>how</i> these areas govern themselves.  The history of the \nArab-Israeli conflict has had important effects on the three countries \ncovered in this assignment.  After years of war, each side has hammered \nout a peace agreement: hopefully paving the way for a lasting peace.  The \neconomic characteristics of Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinians are \nimportant because they may very well play a role in future negotiations \nand peace.  An economic area in particular that has already proven to be \na point of debate is water resources. This will have to be one of many \nissues negotiated on in the coming years.  In our opinion, peace \n<b>can</b> be achieved--it's just a matter of <b>how</b> it's \nachieved.</p>\n<p><h3>All references in this article can be found online.
