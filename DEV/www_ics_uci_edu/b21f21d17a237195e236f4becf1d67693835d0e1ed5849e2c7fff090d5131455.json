(UCI, in fact, does this too--not for music, but for newspapers\rand other publications.)</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>At </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://eee.uci.edu/help/student/copyright/\">http://eee.uci.edu/help/student/copyright/</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>\ryou can see a letter explaining UCI&#39;s policy.  Penn State&#39;s policy\ris described at </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://napster.psu.edu/\">http://napster.psu.edu/</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=1>\r</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>What should UCI&#39;s policy be?  For this\rassignment, you will write a letter to Manuel N. Gomez, UCI&#39;s Vice Chancellor\rfor Student Affairs.  You will recommend a file sharing policy for the campus\rand justify why your recommended policy is better than the alternatives.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You should consider all the stakeholders and\rhow your proposed policy will affect them.  Your recommendations should\rbe practical, not just wishful; you can&#39;t just say &quot;change the\rpolicy to let anyone copy anything,&quot; for example, because both the\runiversity and the individual copiers would be subject to serious legal\rliability.  Note, too, that especially with budget cuts, having the university\rpay for something means that something else will probably have to be cut\ror else additional revenue will have to be raised.  You might also wish\rto consider more broadly what kinds of information should be made easily\ravailable to students; perhaps electronic versions of textbooks would be\ra better service than music, for example.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You may support the current UCI policy or\rpropose changes to it.  You should make focused and specific recommendations\rrather than just complaining about existing problems or proposals.  You\rshould not try to suggest the precise legal wording of any policy you propose,\rbut you should describe clearly what effect you want to achieve and why\rthat effect is the best balance of the various stakeholders&#39; concerns.\r Your recommendations should be grounded in what you know about computer\rscience and about copyright law and the legal system as a whole; it isn&#39;t\rrealistic, for example, to propose that copyright simply not apply to electronic\rinformation.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As always, there is no single &quot;correct\rposition&quot; to take on these issues.  Think about the issues carefully\rand form your own opinion; it&#39;s much easier to write about something\ryou actually believe than to try to fake it.  On the other hand, you must\rapproach your recommendations with enough objectivity to understand the\ropposing point of view and deal with those arguments in a reasoned way.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Stage I:  Report on your approach (outline\rdue May 18)</B></FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>First, read the relevant selections in the\rcourse reading list and the policies referred to above.  Feel free to follow\rup with other news stories and other information on the Web (but be careful\rto evaluate the authority and credibility of your sources).</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Next, decide on the policy you will recommend.\r You won&#39;t include a full stakeholder analysis in the letter you write,\rbut you should still do one yourself to help inform your recommendations.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Then write a one- or two-sentence description\rof the policy you&#39;re recommending, followed by a half-page to one-page\routline (single-spaced) that gives the reasoning and arguments supporting\ryour recommendation. </FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As usual, this is the stage at which you need\rto do much of the work, even though the &quot;deliverable&quot; is short.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>To get credit for this assignment, every student\ris required to meet with Shubha Tandon, the TA in charge of this assignment.\r She will set up a schedule of meetings around the due date.  Be sure to\rkeep the paper copy of your approved outline; you will need to turn it in\rwith the draft and final versions.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>This outline is due electronically to Checkmate\rby Tuesday, May 18; the paper copy is due at your meeting with Shubha.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Stage II:  Write your letter (due May 27)</B></FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Second, write your letter, following your\routline and the TA&#39;s suggestions.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your letter should be at least three and at\rmost five double-spaced pages in 10- or 12-point type.  You can use a simple\rmemorandum form with four lines at the top:  the date, &quot;To:&quot;,\r&quot;From:&quot;, and &quot;Subject&quot;.  Don&#39;t have a huge header\rthat takes up half the first page.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Note that a letter to a policy maker is different\rfrom a research paper:  This letter is shorter, it won&#39;t cite research\rsources as completely and meticulously [though you still should cite credible\rsources to document the assertions you make], and it will recommend to the\rrecipient a particular course of action and address explicitly the reasons\rwhy the recipient should take that action.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Remember, though, that this is an academic\rexercise and should reflect your &quot;academic voice&quot; (semi-formal\rlanguage and correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation).  Writing that\rdoesn&#39;t follow the standards for academic communication (e.g., calling\rone side or the other names, like &quot;greedy corporations&quot; or &quot;student\rpirates&quot;) diminishes the effectiveness of your argument.  </FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>This version will be graded; the TA will make\rcomments and suggest improvements.  Your grade for this part will count\r30% of your grade on the whole assignment, so it pays to do as well as you\rcan at this point.  On Thursday, May 27, turn in:</FONT></P>\r<UL>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>at the beginning of class, both your letter\rand your graded outline (stapled or clipped together), and</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>by class time or right afterwards, an electronic\rcopy of your letter to Checkmate.</FONT></LI>\r</UL>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Be sure to keep the paper copy of your graded\rdraft letter; you will turn it in again with the final version.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Stage III:  Revise your letter (due June\r10)</B></FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your final, revised letter should take into\raccount the TA&#39;s comments.  It should be about the same length (i.e.,\rthe same number of words) as your previous version (unless the TA said to\rlengthen or shorten it), but this final version should be single-spaced\rlike a real letter (so of course it will fill one and a half to two pages).\r This final letter will count 70% of the grade on the whole assignment.\r </FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>On June 10, turn in:</FONT></P>\r<UL>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>at the beginning of class, your final letter,\rthe graded previous version, and your graded outline (all stapled or clipped\rtogether), and</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>by class time or right afterwards, an electronic\rcopy of your final letter to Checkmate.</FONT></LI>\r</UL>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The June 10 date, even more than the others,\ris firm; please plan to turn in what you have completed on that date.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Other important advice:</B>  Assume that\rVice Chancellor Gomez knows at least the basics about copyright law and\rabout computer technology; don&#39;t waste space writing a tutorial.  Focus\rinstead on what policy you propose, what effects you think that policy will\rhave on the major stakeholdes, why it will have those effects, and why those\reffects are good. </FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your grade will depend on how well you inform\ryourself of the relevant issues, state the goals you wish to achieve, determine\ra realistic approach or proposal that achieves your goal, craft an argument\ror justification supporting your approach, support your argument with citations\rfrom credible sources, and express yourself clearly, completely, and succinctly.\r</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Going back to read the general advice on the\r<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/131/voting.html\">voting assignment sheet</A>\rwould be a good idea. In particular, be careful to distinguish fact from\rpredictions of the future or opinions (either your own or ones you cite).\r Also don&#39;t forget the other guidelines on the  &quot;<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/courses/139w/requirements.html\">Writing Assignment Requirements</A>&quot;\rsheet.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>It will help if you plan actually to <I>send</I>\ryour letter, rather than treating it simply as a classroom exercise.  This\rwill help you do a better job by making the whole process more concrete.</FONT></P>\r<BR CLEAR=ALL>\r</BODY>\r</HTML>\r", "encoding": "ascii"}
