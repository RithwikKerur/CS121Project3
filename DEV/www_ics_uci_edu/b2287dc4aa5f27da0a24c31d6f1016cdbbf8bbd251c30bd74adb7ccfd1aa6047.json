We will show\nthat the charges all cancel except for those at L and at U.  To do this,\nwe displace all the vertex and edge charges into a neighboring face, and\nthen group together all the charges in each face.  The direction of\nmovement is determined by the rule that each charge moves horizontally,\ncounterclockwise as viewed from above.\n<P>\n<CENTER>\n<img src=\"charges.gif\">\n</CENTER>\n<P>\nIn this way, each face receives the net charge from an open interval\nalong its boundary.  This open interval is decomposed into edges and\nvertices, which alternate.  Since the first and last are edges, there is\na surplus of one -; therefore, the total charge in each face is zero.\nAll that is left is +2, for L and for U.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nThurston goes on to generalize this idea to a proof that the\n<a href=\"http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/10001.4-7.shtml\">Euler characteristic</a>\nis an invariant of any triangulated differentiable manifold.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
