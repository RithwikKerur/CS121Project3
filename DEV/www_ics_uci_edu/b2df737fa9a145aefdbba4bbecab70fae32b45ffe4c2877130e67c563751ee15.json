That is, G has\nthe vertices a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, and i, and the following edges:\n- an edge from a to b with cost 11\n- an edge from b to c with cost 13\n- an edge from a to d with cost 22\n- an edge from b to e with cost 15\n- an edge from c to f with cost 9\n- an edge from d to e with cost 17\n- an edge from e to f with cost 14\n- an edge from d to g with cost 18\n- an edge from e to h with cost 25\n- an edge from f to i with cost 31\n- an edge from g to h with cost 21\n- an edge from h to i with cost 24\n\n(1) Does G have a cycle or path that visits each edge exactly once\n(allowing repeated vertices)? Why or why not?\n\n(2) What is the length of a shortest cycle that visits each edge of G at\nleast once? As we described in class, this can be found by:\n\n- Making a graph H that has as its vertices only the odd-degree vertices\n  in G\n- Connecting every pair of vertices in H by an edge with length equal to\n  the shortest-path distance between the same vertices in G\n- Finding a minimum-cost perfect matching in H\n- Doubling the edges of G that form the shortest paths between matched\n  pairs of vertices\n- Finding an Euler tour of the modified version of G.\n\nShow the steps of this algorithm.\n\n(3) What tour, with what length, is given by the heuristic for the\ntraveling salesman problem that doubles every edge of the minimum\nspanning tree and finds an Euler tour of the resulting graph?\n\n(4) What tour, with what length, is given by Christofides' heuristic for\nthe traveling salesman problem? This algorithm\n- makes a graph H as in problem (2) for the vertices that have odd\n  degree in the minimum spanning tree\n- finds the minimum cost perfect matching in H,\n- forms a graph with even degrees by combining the minimum spanning tree\n  with the paths connecting the matched pairs of vertices\n- finds an Euler tour in the resulting even-degree graph.\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
