(I should have also disqualified any AI that printed any output to <b>System.out</b>, but I opted to look past this problem.  I redirected all console output to a file and that file was almost 500MB when the tournament was done.  As ICS 23 / CSE 23 students, you shouldn't be turning in code that dumps debug output to the console anymore.)</li>\n  <li>After all the games were played, the results of all games between pairs of AIs that were <i>not</i> disqualified were tabulated.  Any games played by an AI that was subsequently disqualified were thrown out.  As a result, the number of games counted for each AI was the same.  There were 32 AIs that were not disqualified.  Each of them played 62 games (two games against each of the other 31 qualifying AIs).</li>\n  <li>The order of finish in the tournament was determined by two factors:\n    <ul>\n      <li>The <i>winning percentage</i>, which was calculated using the formula: <i>(wins + (ties / 2.0)) / games_played</i>.</li>\n      <li>The total number of tiles earned in all games played, which was used as a tiebreaker if there was a tie on winning percentage.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>20 AIs that compiled were disqualified.  Most of these disqualifications were the result of taking too long to make a move.  One AIs thre an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and a few others made illegal moves.  Four others were disqualified because they didn't compile.</p>\n\n<p>One more reminder: The results of this tournament are purely for entertainment purposes and will not reflect on your grade at all.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">The results</p>\n\n<p><b>Player</b> is the name returned by the getName() method in your OthelloAI implementation.  (Two AIs returned <i>null</i> from the getName() method; they are both listed as \"(null)\" below.)  <b>Total Record</b> indicates your AI's total number of wins, losses, and ties in games played.  <b>Win Pct</b> is your AI's winning percentage.  <b>Total Tiles</b> is the total number of tiles your AI earned in all of the games it played.  <b>Record as Black</b> and <b>Record as White</b> show the number of wins, losses, and ties in games played as the black and white player, respectively.</p>\n\n<table class=\"normal\">\n  <tr class=\"top\"><td>Player</td><td>Total Record</td><td>Win
