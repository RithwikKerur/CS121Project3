At some point during the season, team&nbsp;<i>i</i>\nhas <i>w<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;wins and <i>g<sub>ij</sub></i>&nbsp;games\nleft to play against team&nbsp;<i>j</i>. A team is eliminated if it\ncannot possibly finish the season in first place or tied for first\nplace. The goal is to determine exactly which teams are eliminated. The\nproblem is not as easy as many sports writers would have you believe, in\npart because the answer depends not only on the number of games won and\nleft to play but also on the schedule of remaining games. In the 1960's,\nSchwartz showed how to determine whether one particular team is\neliminated using a maximum flow computation.  This paper indicates that\nthe problem is not as difficult as many mathematicians would have you\nbelieve. For each team&nbsp;<i>i</i>, let <i>g<sub>i</sub></i> denote\nthe number of games remaining. We prove that there exists a\nvalue <i>W</i> such that team&nbsp;<i>i</i> is eliminated if and only if\n<i>w<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<i>g<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;<i>W</i>.\nUsing this surprising fact, we can determine all eliminated teams in\ntime proportional to a single maximum flow computation in a graph\nwith <i>n</i>&nbsp;nodes; this improves upon the previous best known\ncomplexity bound by a factor of&nbsp;<i>n</i>.</p>\n\n\n<p>(Based\non <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~wayne/papers/baseball.pdf\">a\npaper</a> by Kevin D.
