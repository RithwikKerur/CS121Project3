Are we trying to simply put versioning capabilities\n&gt;     in HTTP, are we trying to put *a* versioning capability in HTTP, are\n&gt;     we trying to seamlessly integrate versioning and non-version aware\n&gt;     clients/servers,etc. It looks like the group needs an objective very much;\n&gt;     this in itself could be an interesting exercise, because I think we\n&gt;     will be able to identify multiple layers of functionality that can be\n&gt;     built on top of eachother.\nBasic purpose:\n   I think we need to put hooks into the WWW generally (at a minimum URLs\nand HTTP are affected) so that versioning capabilities in general can be\nadded in accordance with end-user needs.\n\nPratical requirement:\nI think compatibility with non-version aware software is a practical\nnecessity, unless the rest of ther world has some sort of version\nconversion experience. I've been waiting long enough that I've given up\nexpecting that it will ever be 100% accepted.\n\n&gt;   * Thus, I like to make a distinction between versioning in HTTP, which is\n&gt;     a communication protocal, and versioning of web-pages, which is a much\n&gt;     higher level problem. It seems like the two are getting confused in some\n&gt;     of the earlier messages.\n\nI think that we should take a lead from the name of this group \"Working Group on\nVersioning and Configuration Management of World Wide Web Content\". This\nmeans that we should have broader concerns than just HTTP, or just URLs.\nFor instance HTML specific stuff might be appropriate if it's distinct from\nother data types in some way (though I suspect that at least all text/*\ndata types could be trated the same).\n\nOn the other hand, dealing with URLs first, and HTTP second seems sensible\nas an order in which to freeze definitions. I do think that these levels\nwill interact, so that we may not always be able to restrict discussion\nstrictly to \"just HTTP issues\" in isolation from a notion of how the whole\nthing will work together.\n\n&gt;Before I start rambling too much (which I probably already did), I think the\n&gt;group needs to have a common set of goals, possibly layered in some\n&gt;hierarchical plan of attack, as well as a clear separation between versioning\n&gt;features in HTTP, and higher level issues.\n\nI'm not so sure the separations will be clean, so I'd rather focus\npiece-by-piece on parts of the WWW technology base. I think we have a clear\norder:\n\n  + URL convention. We must be able to name things and versions of things.\n\n  + HTTP issues. We must be able to send things around, along with needed\nversion information.\n\n  + Content-type issues. We &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; want to say something specific\nabout some data types, or provide some specialized languages for doing\nversioning-specific things. VTML tried to address passing a complete\ndocument revision tree. We could also address passing updates as well.\n\n   + Configuration management issues? I'm not expert on this stuff, but\nthere are surely some issues here. We need to think if this stuff makes any\nhard requirements on the lower levels, or can just layer on top of anything\neven halfway reasonable.\n\n   -- David\n\n----------------------------------------------+----------------------------\n  David Durand                 <a href=\"mailto:dgd@cs.bu.edu\">dgd@cs.bu.edu</a>  | david@dynamicDiagrams.com\n  Boston University Computer Science          | Dynamic Diagrams\n  <a href=\"http://cs-www.bu.edu:80/students/grads/dgd/\">http://cs-www.bu.edu:80/students/grads/dgd/</a> | http://dynamicDiagrams.com/\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0047.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"High-level capabilities\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0045.html\">David G.
