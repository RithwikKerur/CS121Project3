We model such P2P systems as\nsynchronous dynamic networks. In each round, an adversary can add and\nremove a large number of nodes, and also rewire the network subject to\nsome connectivity constraints. We are interested in solving the problem\nof storing and searching data items despite such high churn rate and\nnetwork dynamism.  In the course of solving this problem, we develop a\nrandom walks based sampling technique to sample nodes uniformly at\nrandom from the network. While it is well known that random walks are\nuseful for sampling, their application in our context is nontrivial\nbecause the churn and network dynamism can potentially bias them or\neven destroy them. Furthermore, we believe that this sampling technique\nmay prove to be useful in a variety of other applications.</p>\n\n(From <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1121\">joint work with Anisur\nMolla, Ehab Morsy, Gopal Pandurangan, Peter Robinson, and Eli Upfal,\npresented at SPAA 2013</a>.)\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
