We describe an algorithm that solves the Maximum-Mean\nSubtree problem, and prove that our algorithm runs in O(n) time in the\nworst case, improving a previous O(n log n) algorithm.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis talk is a presentation of a paper by David Eppstein and Josiah\nCarlson, which was submitted to WADS 2005.\n\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
