You might find \nthis interesting:\n\n--Dan\n\n--\n                    * * * FORWARDED MESSAGE* * *\n\n   Subject: URGENT PETITION -- Fight Govt. Censorship!\n   ___________________________________________________________________\n\nA matter has come to my attention that is of the utmost importance to all of \nus online.\n\nSimply put, a couple of senators have proposed a particularly\nheinous piece of legislation titled the \"Communications\nDecency Act of 1995\"  (Senate Bill S. 314).  Basically, the\nbill would subject all forms of electronic communication --\nfrom public Internet postings to your most private email --\nto government censorship.  The effects of the bill onto the\nonline industry would be devastating -- most colleges and\nprivate companies (AOL, Compuserve, etc.) would probably have\nto shut down or greatly restrict access, since they would be\nheld criminally liable for the postings and email of private\nusers.\n\nA petition, to be sent to Congress, the President, and the media,\nhas begun spreading through the Internet.  It's easy to participate\nand be heard -- to sign it, you simply follow the instructions\nbelow -- which boil down to sending a quick email message to a\ncertain address.  That's all it takes to let your voice be heard.\n(You know, if the Internet makes democracy this accessible to the\naverage citizen, is it any wonder Congress wants to censor it?)\n\nFinally, PLEASE forward this message to all your friends online.\nThe more people sign the petition, the more the government will\nget the message to back off the online community.  We've been doing\nfine without censorship until now -- let's show them we don't plan on\nallowing them to start now.  If you value your freedoms -- from\nyour right to publicly post a message on a worldwide forum to your\nright to receive private email without the government censoring it --\nyou need to take action NOW.  It'll take fifteen minutes at the most,\na small sacrifice considering the issues at hand.  Remember, the age\nof fighting for liberty with muskets and shells is most likely over;\nthe time has come where the keyboard and the phone line will prove\nmightier than the sword -- or the Senate, in this case.\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Here's what you have to do to sign the petition:\n&gt;\n&gt; send an e-mail message to:  S314-petition@netcom.com\n&gt; the message (NOT the subject heading) should read as follows:\n&gt; SIGNED &lt;your online address&gt; &lt;your full name&gt; &lt;U.S. Citizen (y/n)&gt;\n&gt; eg.  SIGNED lsewell@leland.Stanford.EDU  Laura Sewell  YES\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are interested in signing the petition, I would highly suggest\n&gt; investigating the details of the situation.
