Here, we attempt to provide QoS to such interactive applications. In the first paper, interactive users can specify a target througput to be achieved over the duration of the connection. We propose a packet scheduler that balances efficiency with fairness by combining a max-min policy with a policy of serving users with relatively good channels. \r\n      In the second paper, interactive users can specify both a minimum throughput and a maximum rate variance. We characterize the power and rate control policy that minimizes the peak total transmit power.\r\n      \r\n      In the third paper, users can specify thresholds on short term throughputs.

However, unlike the papers above, these applications are now explicitly modeled using sigmoid (s-shaped) utility functions. Whereas elastic applications only require rate scheduling, we find that semi-elastic applications require both rate scheduling and connection access control. The first paper considers the case in which utility is a semi-elastic function of the rate achieved in each time slot. We  propose a near-optimal algorithm that iteratively finds optimal shadow prices for power and rates. The second paper considers the case in which utility is a sigmoid function of the average bit rate over multiple time slots. We are particularly motivated here by video conferencing. We show that greedy allocation to maximize incremental utility in the current time slot can be implemented in a distributed fashion by an exchange of price and demand amongst users, the network, and an intermediate power allocation module. We then propose resource allocation that considers both the average rate achieved so far and the future expected rate, and show how future expected rate can be estimated by modeling the probability that a user will be allocated a subcarrier in a future time slot.</p>\r\n      <blockquote style=\"margin-bottom: 12\">\r\n        <p><strong><a href=\"http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7qs07830\">Downlink User Selection and Resource Allocation for  Semi-Elastic Flows in an OFDM Cell</a></strong> (with C.
