Exact Inference (e.g., variable\r\nelimination, join-tree clustering) are time and space exponentially bounded\r\nby the tree-width of the problem's graph.  Exact Search-based algorithms (e.g.,\r\nbacktracking search) can be executed in linear space and often outperform their\r\nworst-case predictions. Constraint propagation schemes that approximate inference,  can be applied with a\r\n bounded time and space. Likewise stochastic scheme (e.g, local search and sampling schemes) can be interpreted as approximate full search. The thrust of advanced schemes is in finding the right balance between search and inference within a hybrid scheme.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n <p>\r\n The tutorial will present the algorithmic principles behind the progress that has been made in the past decades in constraint processing and probabilistic reasoning for answering a variety of queries such as: determining consistency and finding one or all solutions, finding optimal solutions and answering likelihood and counting queries. \r\n Complexity analysis and empirical demonstration  will be\r\n presented on variety of benchmarks.  Example benchmarks include\r\n radio-frequency problems, linkage analysis, combinatorial auctions, and coding networks.\r\n </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"bio\"></a><font color=\"#f05000\">Speaker Bio</font></h3>\r\n<p style=\"margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"\r\n id=\"internal-source-marker_0.33747440019279684\" dir=\"ltr\"><span\r\n style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span\r\n style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Rina Dechter</span>\r\n is a professor of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine.
