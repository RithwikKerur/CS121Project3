Does your family have a Langsam \r\nconnection? In our tree we have a Tomberg married to Rosie Langsam (born \r\nabout 1893), daughter of Isaac and Tille of Philadelphia, PA. Isaac was \r\nfrom Austria (Galicia?). Rosie and this Tomberg had three sons:\r\nJoseph, a judge in Florida\r\nSaul, an attorney\r\nSidney, testing airplanes in Dayton, OH\r\n\r\nDoes any of this sound familiar?\r\n\r\n-Moishe Miller\r\nmoishe@langsam.com \r\n______________________________________________________\r\nReply-To: \"Stan Tomberg\" <stan@tomberg.net> \r\nFrom: \"Stan Tomberg\" <stan@tomberg.net> \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: Re: Tomberg Family \r\nDate: Fri, 14 Sep 2001 12:17:05 -0400 \r\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 6.00.2600.0000 \r\n\r\n\r\nRosie was married to Izzy (my paternal uncle).

We are distant cousins via \r\nthe LANGSAM family (your wife's father's mother - Saul's mother Rosie). Would you \r\nperhaps be interested in exploring this in more detail? I maintain a website \r\nregarding our extended family at\r\nwww.langsam.com\r\nand would greatly appreciate your input. I am primarily interested in your grandmother's \r\nancestry. I am trying to connect your branch to our tree. Knowing about Rosie's father's \r\nancestry (parent's or siblings) should make this connection possible. Was she born in \r\nPhiladelphia or Europe. Did her father marry in the USA or Europe? Where in Europe was \r\nher father from? Do you know of any LANGSAM cousins at your grandmother's generational \r\nlevel? \r\n\r\nWishing you a Happy Jewish New Year,\r\nMoishe Miller\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n  \r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 9/22/01</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
