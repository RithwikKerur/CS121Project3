It offers \npeople a simple way to both access information all over the world and bring \nthat information to their fingertips.  <i><a href=\"#ftp\">FTP</i></a> allows access to countless files\nand programs; <i><a href=\"#telnet\">Telnet</i></a> enables people to access remote computer sites;\n<i><a href=\"#gopher\">Gopher</i></a> helps to locate information that exists on the Internet;\n<i><a href=\"#usenet\">Usenet</i></a> establishes countless\nnewsgroups in <i><a href=\"#cyberspace\">cyberspace</a></i> that allows users to communicate on a wide range of subjects;\nand the <i><a href=\"#www\">World Wide Web</i></a> provides a connected library of files, documents, and resources\nthat can be linked to one another by the touch of a button.  While the application of \nthese resources is seemingly endless, there is a distinct interest worldwide in\nutilizing the Internet's capabilities for the purpose of education.\n<p>\n<dd>The <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet's</a> resources provide a bright future for advancements in education.\nThrough the use of the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a>, students are able to have at their fingertips an entire\nlibrary's worth of resources for research and studying. Instead of learning from\njust one textbook, students can use the information from hundreds of text materials, each offering\na different approach to a similar subject.  The opportunites created by the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">\nInternet</a> is such that the scope of a child's education is no longer confined to the walls of the classroom, but rather\nis opened to the unending growth of information and resources in cyberspace.  However, the idea of a <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a>\n also creates concerns about abuse of the freedom the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> provides to the students\nand the sacrifice of student-teacher interaction that is made with a computerized curriculum.\n<p>\n<dd>This paper will examine these complex issues that underlay the basic application\nof <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> education. On one hand, the sheer capacity of information and resources\nthat students and teachers alike can access through the Net is unsurpassed and \nshould be utilized to its utmost effectiveness.  On the other hand, the convention\nof classroom education offers some essential elements that cannot be achieved or\nduplicated on a computer screen. This paper aims to examine just how well the \n<a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> can duplicate and improve a conventional classroom curriculum and, further,\nto highlight the necessary human elements that are unable to be emulated by\ncomputers.  While the concept of a <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a> is slowly becoming a reality,\nthe consequences of such a powerful educational medium must be considered.  \n<br>  \n<HR>\n<dd><b>Return to <a href=\"#table of contents\"><i>Table of Contents</i></a></b>\n<hr>\n<p>\n<H1><A NAME=\"virtual classroom\">Designing the Virtual Classroom</A></H1>\nThe primary goal in designing a <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a>\n is to make as many resources as possible available to students and teachers.   In addition, these resources must be easily accessible and easy to use.\n  With this premise in mind, I have taken the steps to emulate a typical high school curriculum using the services available on the\n <a href=\"http://www. rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a>.  The curriculum consists of five main subjects: <a href=\"#math\">Algebra</a>,\n <a href=\"#english\">English Literature</a>,<a href=\"#biology\"> Biology</a>, <a href=\"#history\">U.S. History</a>, and <a href=\"#foreign\">Spanish</a>. \n  The purpose in this simulation is twofold. First, I intend to establish the effectiveness of the <a href=\"http://www. rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">\nInternet's</a> resources in providing a comparable level of education to the level currently available in conventional classrooms.  Second, I will \nshow the ways in which virtual learning offers opportunities to teachers and students that are not available in today's centers of education.\n In order to avoid simply creating a list of relevant sites, I will keep the emulations simple, yet effective. \n I have included a more comprehensive <a href=\"#general resources\">list of resources</a> at the end of the paper that can also be used to facilitate\n learning in the <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a>.  \n\n<h2><a name=\"math\">Algebra</a></h2>\n<p> There are two elements involved in teaching and learning mathematics.  First,  the concepts and the logic of the mathematical science need to be\n explained in a discernible manner.  Second, the student must complete a series of exercises and problems in order to practically understand the concepts.  Both of these elements can be successfully achieved on the  <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a>.  The mathematical core of cyberspace is located at\n <a href=\"http://sailfish.peregrine.com/wb/ww/\"><b>Mathematics City</b></a> where students can access many mathematical resources such as sample problems, \ngames, lesson plans, discussion groups, graphical displays, and, of course, a <a href=\"http:\n\n//www.charm.net/~web/Calc.html\">calculator</a>.  Other links can provide students with plenty of <a href=\"http://www.ama.caltech.edu/resources.html\">other resources</a> to assist them in learning and practicing math. \n\n<h2><a name=\"english\">English Literature</a></h2>\nThe  <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> is a tremendous learning tool for literature.  The typical english student spends hours searching in libraries and bookstores for literary works.  With the touch of a button, \n\n\n\na student in the <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a> has instant access to an <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web /books.html\">On-Line \nBookstore</a> and an <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/Web/e-libraries.html\">On-Line Library</a>\n where  <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html\"> Hypertext links</a> allow the student to search through catalogs of titles from <a href=\"ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/doc/literary/by-author/Dickens,Charles/\">Charles Dickens</a> to <a href\n\n=\"http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare.html\">William Shakespeare</a>.  The student could also log on to the <a href=\"usenet://alt.usage.english\">English Grammar Newsgroup</a> to get help and information on writing, comprehension, and grammar. By discussing\n\n\n\n books, authors, and literature with people around the world, students are rewarded with varying approaches to  and interpretations of literary texts.  The ability to access books at the touch of a button also helps to keep students interested in reading \n\n\n\nand exploring literature.\n\n<h2><a name=\"biology\">Biology</a></h2>\nImagine a biology student having access to over sixty different discussion groups, each covering a unique topic in biology.  That resource is available through <a href=\"ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/\"><b>Usenet</a></b> to students in the <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~\n\n\n\nVOU\">virtual classroom</a>.  Not only does this allow students to access information on all types of biology, but it also allows them to communicate with students at other schools from over the world about a common interest in the subject.  The virtual cu\n\n\n\nrriculum can even include a step by step computerized <a href=\"http://george.lbl.gov/ITG.hm.pg.docs/Whole.Frog/Whole.Frog.html\">Frog Dissection</a> .  Again, the capability of having so much information at one's fingertips elevates a student's learning po\n\n\n\ntential to a different level.\n\n<h2><a name=\"history\">U.S. History</a></h2>\nHistory is a dry, often boring subject because it is simply a recollection of events that happened in the past.  Computerized multimedia is a great way to cure the monotony of a history class.  In cyberspace, students can find information on any historica\n\n\n\nl event in the thousands of sites devoted to history.  Instead of reading from a textbook, students can embark on an historical adventure through American history by searching through <a href=\"http://rs6.loc.gov/amtitle.html\">The Scrapbook of American His\n\n\n\ntory</a> presented by the Library of Congress.  Everyday a student could take a field trip to the <a href=\"http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/\">Interactive Natural History Museum</a> and learn something different about life in the past.  The interactive style of c\n\n\n\nomputerized education places the student in the driver's seat and allows him/her to explore through various <a href=\"ftp://ftp.uu.net/doc/literary/obi/History/\"> historical subjects</a> and events.  This freedom is beneficial in a subject such as history,\n\n\n\n however it is not feasible in a conventional classroom to have this type of access to such a broad range of interesting places.\n\n<h2><a name=\"foreign\">Spanish</a></h2>\nSince learning a foreign language is achieved predominantly through memorization, the computer is a wonderful tool for Spanish students.  Students can log on to a <a href=\"http:www.willamette.edu/~tjones/Spanish/Spanish-main.html\">Virtual Spanish Classroo\n\n\n\nm</a> and receive a lesson plan complete with vocabulary, pronunciation, and translation exercises. With the help of multimedia, students can also hear audio files of certain pronunciations so that they get a first hand connection with the language. <a hr\n\n\n\nef=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html\"> Hypertext links</a> allow you to jump from lesson to lesson so that you can learn at your own pace.  Although there are still limited sites for certain languages, the applications continue to grow.  \n\n\n\n\n\t<p>Perhaps the most useful resource offered on the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> for foreign language students is    other net users from around the world.  Because cyberspace is an internationally accessed de\n\n\n\nstination, Spanish  students can talk  or send mail to people in South America or Spain over the internet. In addition,  students have the opportunity to <a href=\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/world/\">travel abroad</a> to places around the world.  By experienc\n\n\n\ning the people, the sites, and the culture of a country, students gain another dimension to learning a language.\n<br>\n<pre>\n</pre>\nAs you can see, it is definitely feasible to establish an effective curriculum using the Internet's resources.  As more and more scholars and educators become familiar with the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a>, th\n\n\n\ne resources and services that cater towards education will grow exponentially.  Never before has information been packaged in a way that with a simple click of a button, information is linked together and immediately accessible all over the world.  While \n\n\n\nwe can only guess and wonder about the future applications of this phenomenal resource, the current direction of computerized education should be examined closely and carefully.\n<HR>\n\n<dd><b>Return to <a href=\"#table of contents\"><i>Table of Contents</i></a></b>\n<hr>\n<DT><H1><A NAME=\"pros and cons\">Pros and Cons of Computerized Education</A></H1>\n<p>While the application of computerized education becomes more and more of a reality, it is essential to examine the effects of this advancement on the educational system itself.  After all, with all of the developments made in the educational arena, non\n\n\n\ne is more drastic nor more significant than the computerization of the educational curriculum. Because of the grand scale of this change, the cost benefits must be considered before such change is implemented.\n\n<p>The positive aspects of computerizing education is fundamental and obvious.  Today, the major restriction placed on a student's ability to learn or a teacher'\ns ability to teach is the resources that are available to both teacher and student.  The resources available to teachers today are limited by shrinking budgets and restricted space. These limitations directly effect the standard of education that students\n\n\n\n receive.  The <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> offers both teachers and students the ability to broaden the pool of resources available to them.  Teachers are able to use \n<a href=\"ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/\"><b>Usenet</a></b>  to gain important communication with other educators from around the world.  Also, <a href=\"gopher://gopher.gsfc.nasa.gov\"><b>FTP<a/></b> and the <a href=\"http://info.cern.ch/\"><b>World Wide Web</a></b> off\n\n\n\ner teachers access to a broad range of <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/afs/athena.mit.edu/user/d/j/djkahle/www/library2\">lesson plans, text materials, and other course related materials</a> that bring new insight and approaches to their curricula. The st\n\n\n\nudents are the ones that benefit most from the <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a>.  The  <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> opens them up to a world of  information and references.   Students can\n\n\n\n use <a href=\"ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/creating-newsgroups/*\"><b>Usenet</a></b>  to join worldwide <a href=\"ftp://nic.umass.edu/pub/ednet/edusenet.gde\">newsgroups</a> which allow them to discuss tons of educational related topics. <a hre\n\n\n\nf=\"gopher://gopher.gsfc.nasa.gov/\"><b>FTP<a/></b> providess access to educational programs, files, and <a href=\"ftp://nic.umass.edu/pub/ednet/educatrs.lst\">mailing lists</a> that can  enhance the scope of any subject.  Perhaps the most useful resource ava\n\n\n\nilable to students is the <a href=\"http://info.cern.ch/\">World Wide Web</a>.  Not only does the <a href=\"http://info.cern.ch/\">web</a> present students with computerized <a href=\"http://www.w2.org/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html\">libraries</\n\n\n\na>, <a href=\"http:wwwhost.cc.utexas.edu/world/instruction/index.html\">lecture halls</a>, and <a href=\"http://ics.soe.umich.edu\">interactive learning groups</a>, but <a name=\"html2\">the</a> Web's unique\n<a href=\"#html\"><i>HTML</a></i><a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html\"> hypertext format</a> allows students to continually find new links to more <a href=\"http://cuiwww.unige.ch/eao/www/WWW95/paper.html\">educational resources</a> on t\n\n\n\nhe  <a href=\"http://info.cern.ch/\">web</a>.  The perpetual increase in resources and services that the <a href=\"http://www.ncssa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/html-primer.html\">hypertext links</a> provide for both students and teachers is the single most significant e\n\n\n\nlement of the <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a> because it connects students and educators with the latest information and resources available.\n\n<p>There are, of course, some elements of a conventional classroom that cannot be emulated by a computer. For example, physical interaction with teachers and classmates cannot be achieved through a computer.  While interaction and communication between tw\n\n\n\no people is possible on the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a>, the physical exchange is lost. Although this may appear to be a simple sacrifice, the ability to physically interact with others is an integral part of\n\n\n\n a child's maturity and therefore is an element that should be included in the child's education.  Further,  there are situations in the classroom where hands on experience is necessary in order for a student to understand the work.  Subjects such as art,\n\n\n\n ceramics, physical education, chemistry, and auto shop would be impossible to learn solely on a computer because hands on experience is necessary.  Students could use the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> to gain \n\n\n\ninformation about these subjects, but they would not be able to use the keyboard to do the exercises, make the pottery, fix the engine, paint the canvas, or mix the chemicals.  Although some strides have been made to emulate hands on activities on a compu\n\n\n\nter screen (such as computerized\n<a href=\"http://george.lbl.gov/ITG.hm.pg.docs/Whole.Frog/Whole.Frog.html\"> frog dissections</a>), there is still an inevitable void in terms of hands on experience in a<a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a>.  \n\n<p>The fundamental difference between conventional classroom education and a computerized curriculum is one of single versus multiple dimensions of application  Classrooms are one dimensional in the sense that students and teachers only have access to the\n\n\n\n tools and resources that exist in the confines of the classroom walls.  Computers, on the other hand, offer limitless boundaries to the scope of information and services available to students and educators.This after all is the purpose and intent of Cybe\n\n\n\nrspace.  However, when it comes to physical interaction and hands on experience, the classroom offers more dimensions than the computer offers.  Ideally, the two exclusive elements will be combined in a way that the strengths of each entity will be emphas\n\n\n\nized and a completely multi-dimensional classroom environment will be achieved. \n<HR>\n<dd><b>Return to <a href=\"#table of contents\"><i>Table of Contents</i></a></b>\n<hr>\n<A NAME=\"resources\"><h1>Educational Resources on the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet.</a></h1>\n<br>\nIn the previous section I have discussed the application of the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet's</a> resources in regards to a typical high school curriculum.

In today's society, people go to school in order to get an education because that is where information is distributed.  However, the technological advancements in computers and speci\n\n\n\nfically in the <a href=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> threaten to change the protocol of this distribution.  Simply put, information can be distributed more effectively, more efficiently, and more abundantly on a comput\n\n\n\ner than in a classroom.  Ironically, the degree to which the Net becomes an institution of learning is directly contingent upon the number of people who become educated about the Internet itself.  If people do not make themselves familiar with the <a href\n\n\n\n=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/text.html\">Internet</a> and its capabilities, then there will be nobody to take advantage of the resources available.  The technological revolution that has flourished in the past twenty years has made speed and\n\n\n\n efficiency the primary elements of success in our society.  Consequently, the speed and efficiency that the <a href=\"http://symnet.net/~VOU\">virtual classroom</a> brings to education will be the catalyst for academic success in the future.\n<p>Unfortunately, the human element will never be fully emulated on a computer screen.  Even with the recent developments in multimedia, where live images can be transmitted from computer to computer, a screen cannot replace the effect or the impact of pe\n\n\n\nrsonal interaction. The reality is that the physical interaction of student and teacher is a necessary aspect of learning that cannot be sacrificed.  As it was stated earlier, the greatest improvements in the education system will come as a result of the \n\n\n\nintegration of human and computer resources. While the technology is available today, the application and implementation of this technology will have to wait until we decide that we cannot do without it. \n<HR>\n<dd><b>Return to <a href=\"#table of contents\"><i>Table of Contents</i></a></b>\n<hr>\n<H1><a name=\"glossary\"><dd><b><u>Glossary of Terms</a></b></H1></u>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a name=\"cyberspace\"><b><u>Cyberspace</u></b> - The intangible, computerized world behind the computer screen where all of the Internet's faculties function to perform the actions dictated by remote clients and servers.</a>\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n<i>Go back to <a href=\"#introduction\">document</a></i>\n<hr>\n<p>\n<a name=\"ftp\"><b><u>FTP</u></b> - File transfer protocol, a means to exchange files across a \nnetwork.
