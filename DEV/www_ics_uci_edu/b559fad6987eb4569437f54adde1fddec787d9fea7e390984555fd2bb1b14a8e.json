ALEXANDER</H3>\n</center>\n\n\nIn October 1997 I spent a month examining original genealogical documents in the Krakow branch \nof the Polish National Archives, located at 16 Sienna Street, not far from the Krakow Main Post \nOffice. Prior to going to Krakow I had written to the Main Office of the Archives in Warsaw on \nDluga Street 6 and requested permission to have access to the Krakow branch, stating that I intend \nto write a book about the history of Krakow during the last to hundred years, using the history of \nmy family as the starting point. In return I have received a formal notice, giving me the right to full \naccess to documents that I might need.\n<P>\nHaving lived in Krakow from 1925 to 1944 and having survived the Holocaust in Poland, I knew \nthat my family was large and that my ancestors lived in Krakow for many generations. I knew that \nthere were three related branches of my family living in Krakow prior to the Second World War. \nThere were also some additional, more distant, relatives in Krakow as well. The three branches \nwere grouped and colloquially known by the type of business that they ran or by their place of \nresidence, as the Aleksandrowicz family with a leather business, or with a paper, stationery and art \nsupplies business and as the Aleksandrowicz family living in Podgorze, an outlying region of \nKrakow, located across the Vistula River from the city center. My aim was to find out how long \nhave my ancestors lived in Krakow, when did they begin to use the surname Aleksandrowicz or \nAlexandrowicz (\"x\" or \"ks\" being used interchangeably, with older documents using \"x\"), when did \nthe name first appear in official records and how was the name derived. Also, I wanted to establish \nthe exact relationship between the various branches of the Aleksandrowicz clan. And, incidentally, \nI wanted to revisit the places where I lived before and during the Second World War. I was able to \nestablish a definite family tree of my Aleksandrowicz forebears in Krakow back in time to the year \n1783, but found little information about the name's origin. I did pay a sentimental visit to the \nassorted places in Krakow and vicinity which I remembered from before the War. \n<P>\nBefore he died in 1968 my father sat down with me and we made copious notes of family history. \nAlso, he and I took notes of our conversations with an older relative, my father's aunt, Amalia \nKaufer, who emigrated to America from Vienna in 1938. I found these notes invaluable. Having \nthe names of the last three generations of my family saved me a lot of time and made my search \nmuch easier. Knowledge of old family stories and of legends about the family origin provided me \nwith important clues. I believe that recording oral history from older family members should \nalways be the first step in any genealogical research.\n<P>\nI began the search for my roots in the Krakow Archives with the latest records. A lot of \ninformation in them was fami1iar to me and I worked my way back in time as far as I could go. I \nused the records to augment and, if necessary, correct the information that I remembered or that \nmy father provided me with.  Then I proceeded systematically back, checking records from \n193O's, 1920's, 1910's, 1900's, 1880's and beyond, including lists of inhabitants, birth, marriage \nand death records, conscription lists and census books back to 1790's, as well as business and \nprofessional lists and even phone directories from the thirties. I also checked some more recent \ndocuments of the present Krakow City Government and the one document available in the Jewish \nCommunity Council. The latter has only one list of cemetery burials extant, partly singed, having \nsurvived hidden in a chimney. All other books have been lost during the Nazi era. I have visited \nboth the Remuh and the Miodowa Street Jewish cemeteries in Krakow and tried to read many of \nthe tombstone inscriptions that remained after the Nazi depredations. I also consulted a number of \nsecondary sources prior to my trip to Poland and reexamined them after my return in the light of \nmy Krakow findings. These secondary sources proved extremely useful (A list of the records that \nI saw in Poland and of some of the other sources is appended).\n<P>\nI found the personnel of the Krakow Archives uniformly polite and most helpful. In particular, \nwithout the courteous and efficient assistance of the archivist Ms Aneta Szpilka I would not have \nbeen able to do as well as I did. I was told which documents were available and shown all that I \nrequested.  While most Jewish rabbinical and communal records have been destroyed during the \nWar, Jewish records kept by the Imperial Austrian officials specially designated to keep Jewish \ndata (Krakow was under Austrian influence or a part of the Habsburg Empire for most of the time \nthat I was interested in) are largely intact and most are kept in the Krakow Archives. These \nrecords are mostly in Polish, with some German.  The loss of the Jewish records means that the \ndates of purely religious marriages and burials are hard to find and are generally not available.\n<P>\nMy knowledge of Polish was of tremendous help in my search in Krakow. Use of a translator, \nwhile necessary for anyone who does not know Polish, is not completely satisfactory, because \nbesides knowledge of the language, knowledge of spellings and permutations of Jewish names, \nand awareness of Krakow Jewish history and customs is helpful in understanding the available \nrecords. Most current Polish translators do not have a thorough grounding in Jewish lore.\n<P>\nFor example, traditionally, Krakow Jews did not name their children after living relatives but did \nname them after recently departed ones.  Thus, names tend to repeat themselves in Krakow \nJewish genealogy every two-to-three generations or roughly every 50-80 years. This is often \nhelpful in determining relationships, specially when the names are rather rare and unusual but part \nof a family tradition. Also, first names do not have to repeat themselves exactly. In the more \nrecent times it was often enough for the first letter of a name in daily use to correspond to the \nname of the departed. It was customary for even non-religious Krakow Jews to have, in addition \nto their everyday first names, religious \"Hebrew\" names.  These Hebrew names were more likely \nto correspond to that of the deceased relative.  Thus, my father, Max Alexander, born in Krakow \nin 1902, used in everyday life in Poland the name of Maksymilian Aleksandrowicz, but also had a \nHebrew name of Menashe ben Yaakov ha-Kohen after his great grandfather Menashe, born in \nKrakow in 1818.  The fact that my father carried that name told me that his great-grandfather \nMenashe, whose date of death I could not find, must have died before 1902. I was named Jerzy \n(diminutive Jurek, pronounced Yoo-rek) Aleksandrowicz, but also given a Hebrew name of \nYitzhak ben Menashe ha-Kohen, after my mother's father, Isaac Rosenberg, who must have died \nprior to my birth, in 1925.\n<P>\nJews lived in Poland since what were for Poland pre-historic times, i.e. from before the year 996 \nA.D. In fact, it was a Jewish merchant and traveler, Abraham ben Jacob from Tortosa in Arab \nSpain, who first mentioned the town of Krakow in describing his travels in the 10-th century. It is \nlikely that the first historic Polish monarchs (1000-1200 A.D.) had Jewish minters, inasmuch as \ncoins with Hebrew lettering from Poland from that period exist. Formal recorded Jewish history \nin Poland begins in 1264 with the issuance of a protective charter to Jews by the ruler of the small \nDuchy of Kalisz, Boleslaw the Pious (1221-1279), making them wards of the ruler and offering \nprotection of life and possessions.  King of Poland Casimir the Great (Kazimierz Wielki, 1310-\n1370) issued such a protective covenant, covering the entire country. Casimir invited Jews to \nsettle in his kingdom and even established in 1335 a Jewish community in a township that he \nfounded near Krakow, which is named after him, Kazimierz (it was incorporated into the city of \nKrakow in 1791).  There is a legend in Poland that Casimir the Great had a Jewish mistress. Her \nname was said to be, appropriately enough, Esterka.\n<P>\nKrakow was the capital of the Polish Kingdom until the 17-th Century, when King Sigismund \nVasa moved the capital to Warsaw. However, even later Krakow remained the place of \ncoronation and final resting of Polish monarchs as well as the pre-eminent center of Polish  \nculture. The removal of the capital allowed Krakow to avoid a lot of modernization and helped it \nto retain a lot of its mediaeval and Renaissance character.\n<P>\nJews in Krakow settled in the area bounded today by St. Anne (once called Judengasse), \nJagiellonska and Golebia Streets.  This was a time of great persecution of Jews in Western Europe \nand Casimir's Poland offered them a welcome refuge. By 1469 Krakow Jews had two \nsynagogues, a communal bath, a school and two cemeteries. As in Worms in Germany, defending \none of the defensive towers and gates in the wall surrounding mediaeval Krakow, was the \nresponsibility of the Jews and the gate was known as the Jewish Gate. The gate is long gone but \nthere is a memorial plaque on the spot where it stood. The Jewish land, located close to the town \ncenter, was coveted by Krakow's University, originally began by Casimir the Great in 1364 and \nchartered by King Wladyslaw Jagiello (hence the name Jagiellonian University).  Eventually, in \n1495 King Jan Olbracht expelled the Jews from Krakow proper, moved them to the nearby \nKazimierz, and gave their land to the University, which is still located there.\n<P>\nThe Kazimierz district, while at first a separate community and separated from the city by a river \nbed, was located within the shadow of the royal enclave on Wawel Hill, thus providing the Jews \nwith royal protection. It was also within easy walking distance not only of the Castle but also of \nthe city center. The Jews in Krakow and Kazimierz had good times and bad times, often reflecting \nthe ups and downs of Poland and its economy. They continually struggled with Krakow burgers \nwho tried to limit their trading rights. In 1453 the celebrated Italian rabble-rouser and anti-Semite, \nlater canonized as St. John of Capistrano, came to Krakow, preached hatred for the Jews in his \nsermons and incited pogroms. A tablet commemorating Capistrano's visit can be seen on the wall \nof the Bernardine Cloister in Krakow, located on Bernardynska Street, where I lived prior to \n1940. In 1525 a renowned Talmudic scholar Reb Moses Isserles (Remuh) was born in Krakow. \nThe only presently functioning Krakow synagogue was founded by Remuh' father. In 16-th \nCentury the Polish Jews had a considerable degree of autonomy. Their taxes were regulated by a \nJewish Parliament, the Council of Four Lands (Vaad Arba Aratzot) established in 1549 and \nlasting for more than two hundred years. This Jewish Parliament, unique in history, controlled \nrelations between communities, established local Jewish courts, ritual slaughterhouses and ritual \nbaths and maintained charities and poorhouses.\n<P>\nIn 1648 the peasants and the Cossacks in then Polish Ukraine rebelled, under the leadership of \nBogdan Chmielnicki, against Polish landowners.  Not being able to reach the hated magnates who \nwere safe in their palaces in Warsaw, Krakow or Paris, the rebels wreaked their vengeance on \nJewish \"arendars\" (holders of rights to collect taxes owed to the nobility), rural tavern keepers and \nothers.  Large number of Jews in the eastern reaches of the Polish territories perished, some \nescaped to Krakow. A Swedish Lutheran invasion that followed the Cossack attacks also \ncontributed to the impoverishment of the country, which included Krakow's Jewish population. In \n1783 the first person documented to later carry the Aleksandrowicz name was born. In 1784 was \nborn his future wife, Dobrysh Freindel, daughter of Jacob called Gumple, later known as \nGumplowicz. In 1790, under the last Polish King, Stanislaw August Poniatowski, a census of \nJews was undertaken, listing those living in royal towns like Krakow and Kazimierz, but also in \nprivately owned small towns and villages, whose owners certified the listing of \"their\" Jews. I \nhave examined the original pages of this census, covering the Krakow district and parts of \nSouthwestern Poland in the Krakow Archives on Sienna Street and found indications that my \nancestors lived in Krakow at least since 1725. There is a later census, made by the Austrians when \nthey came to Krakow in 1796. In this census, too, there are indications of my Aleksandrowicz \nforebears living in Krakow at least from 1700. \n<P>\nThere were two comprehensive listings of inhabitants of the Jewish Town of Kazimierz prepared\ntoward the end of the eighteenth century, one in 1790, the other in 1796. I have serious \nreservations about the dates at which these were supposedly prepared. Judging by the recorded \nages of my ancestors in the two lists, the data must have been provided to the census takers at \ntimes other than the formal dates of the publications. There are striking similarities between the \ntwo records and general internal consistencies about the ages of the individual family members in \neach, but significant differences between the two records, which can only be reconciled by \nassuming that some of the data was post-dated or pre-dated when entered. The first census, in \nPolish, was done when Krakow was still a part of independent Poland, around 1790; the second, \nin German, was taken by the Austrians who occupied Krakow in 1796. My ancestors appear in \nboth. In the Austrian list there appears a boy named Joseph, and a girl named Dobrysz (Dobosch), \nwho are likely to be the ones who later married. As in their marriage record, Joseph is one year \nolder than Dobrysh. Her father is Jacob Gumple, his Herschel, son of David. Her mother is Sara, \nof the Abeles, his is Rifka of the Jekeles. Jacob appears to have been born around 1760, Sara \naround 1766, Herschel around 1764, Rifka around 1765. In the Polish census no children were \nlisted, but Joseph's father and mother are listed as Herszla Dawidowicz, 30, and Rywka, 28. In \nboth lists, Herschel has an older brother, Jacob, who is married to Rifka's sister, Judith of the \nJekeles.\n<P>\nBetween 1772 and 1796 Poland was being invaded by the armies of Russia, Austria and Prussia. \nIn 1794, the great Polish patriot and a hero of American Revolution, Tadeusz Kosciuszko, led an \nuprising against Tsarist armies from Krakow. With his American experience, Kosciuszko saw that \nPolish aristocracy alone cannot win a war against the invaders; he therefore tried to enlist peasants \nand Jews in his army. He offered peasants relief from serfdom and Jews emancipation.  He did \nhave a Jewish battalion led by colonel Berek, son of Yosel (Berek Yoselewicz). Initially \nsuccessful, the Kosciuszko armies were eventually defeated by superior forces and by 1796 \nPoland was erased from the map of Europe. Krakow was occupied by the armies of Austria. \nAustrian emperors insisted that their subjects have family names, i.e. surnames. Krakow Jews, \nwho until then mostly used patronymics, nicknames and such, gradually began to adapt surnames. \nHaving been recorded by Austrian officials, the surnames usually had a Germanic cast.  \n<P>\nEarly in the 19-th Century, Napoleon Bonaparte, leading victorious French armies, created a \nDuchy of Warsaw and in 1809, after the battle of Wagram, Krakow was attached to the Duchy. \nNapoleon was defeated in 1812 and in 1815 the Congress of Vienna awarded the Duchy of \nWarsaw to the Tsar as King of Poland. However, the city of Krakow with Kazimierz and its \nJewish Town (where all Jews had to live) became a small independent republic, governed by a \nSenate. The \"Free, independent and strictly neutral\" Krakow Republic lasted until 1846, when it \nwas incorporated into the Austrian province of Galitzia. In 1818 my ancestor Menashe \nAleksandrowicz was born. In 1845 Menashe had a son, my great-grandfather Jozef \nAleksandrowicz (1845-1940), whom I knew when I was little. Three years later, in 1848, Franz \nJosef of Habsburg became emperor. At first an inexperienced young man, Franz Jozef eventually \nbecame a wise and rather permissive ruler.  Provinces of the empire received a lot of autonomy, \nwhich meant that all governmental affairs in Krakow were conducted in Polish. Restrictions on \nJews were gradually eliminated.  By 1867 they could live anywhere in Krakow, not only in the \nJewish area of Kazimierz.  They received the right to vote and sent representatives to the \nParliament in Vienna.  They joined the Krakow Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and they \nstudied, in numbers, at the Jagiellonian University. Among those who got their doctorates at this \nUniversity were two of my uncles, both lawyers, Ignacy and Wilhelm Aleksandrowicz. The Jews \ngenerally fared well under the benign Habsburg rule and nearly worshipped the old Franz Josef.\n<P>\nAfter World War I (1914-1918) Poland regained its independence.  A large Jewish minority of \nmore than 10% of the total population, living among a very strongly Catholic populace was bound \nto have problems. The coexistence was never easy or free of rancor. Jew-baiting was always a \nsure-fire method for ambitious politicians to garner votes.  Some honest Polish patriots believed \nthat it was their patriotic duty to try to rid Poland of Jews and to accomplish it not by violence but \nthrough an economic boycott, hoping that impoverishing the Jews would force them to emigrate \nfrom the country.  Among those who called for such a boycott was the leader of the anti-Semitic \nNational Democratic Party Roman Dmowski, who along with Ignace Jan Paderewski represented \nPoland at the Treaty of Versailles, and a prominent Roman-Catholic priest, Maksymilian Kolbe, \nwho was beatified by the present Pope.\n<P>\nIn Warsaw's St. John's Cathedral there is a memorial plaque to Roman Dmowski (1864-1959) \nwith this quote from his writings: \"Catholicism is not an addition to Polonism - it is imbedded in \nits essence. Attempts to separate Catholicism from Polonism would destroy the very essence of \nthe nation\", which explains the rationale behind his virulent anti-Semitism. Prior to 1939 Father \nKolbe, who was later shot by the Nazis, founded a large catholic publishing enterprise which \nincluded a journal \"Dziennik Niepokalanej\" (Virgin's Daily\"), that had as its primary purpose \nadvocacy of a boycott of Jewish enterprises. It is indeed a pity that in a country as poor as was \nPoland between the two World Wars, seemingly intelligent and honest patriots spent so much \nenergy trying to impoverish 10% of the population, instead of welcoming the fact that some \ncitizens and taxpayers were innovative entrepreneurs whose domestic and international activities \nwere enriching the country.\n<P>\nI was born in 1925. At the time my family owned two elegant apartment buildings on \nBernardynska Street in Krakow, facing the Royal Castle on Wawel Hill. From my window I could \nsee the Castle Keep. As I remember it, in spite of all political problems in Poland, life in Krakow \nin the 1930's was fairly pleasant for well-to-do Jews and non-Jews alike. Krakow, then a city of \n250,000 inhabitants, of which 60,000 were Jewish, was a center of culture, with many outstanding \neducational institutions.  The Jews fully participated in the town's lively cultural, social and \npolitical life. All of this ended, of course, when the German troops entered in September of 1939. \nJews were herded into a Ghetto, not in Kazimierz but in the outlying district of Podgorze.  From \nthe ghetto, most people, including all elderly and children (among them my mother and my 11-\nyear-old sister), were deported to the extermination center in Belzec. The rest were taken to a \nconcentration camp in Krakow-Plaszow nearby, described in the book and movie \"Schindler's \nList\". As the Russian armies were approaching in 1944, surviving camp inmates, myself included, \nwere shipped to concentration camps in Austria. Krakow, in the meantime, existed without Jews.\n<P>\nAfter the war, surviving Jews were not greeted with friendly hugs, their possessions having been \nappropriated in their absence.  The Polish Communists, among them some Jews, were beholden to \nRussia, which did not endear them to the strongly anti-Russian catholic population.  There was a \nmajor pogrom in Kielce in central Poland in which many people were killed, and a minor one in \nKrakow, with \"only\" one or two victims. Most of the remaining Jews, except for a few who \nintermarried with non-Jews, emigrated when the Communists began an anti-Jewish campaign in \nthe 196O's. Today, the Krakow Jewish commune has 189 registered members. There are also a \nfew people of Jewish origin who do not necessarily consider themselves Jewish. Anti-Semitism \nwithout Jews is still a potent force in Poland, but there is also a curious revival of interest in Jews \nand their culture among young Poles. A well-attended Jewish Cultural Festival is being held each \nJune. In Kazimierz there is now a Jewish branch of the Polish National Museum, there are \n\"Jewish\" restaurants featuring what purports to be typical Jewish food and in front of one of these \nrestaurants are non-Jews dressed like Hasidic Jews.  This \"revival\" is very sad and pathetic.   I see \nno future for Jews in Krakow.  A proud long history of many centuries has come to an end.\n<P>\nAs stated above, until the fall of Poland in 1796 Krakow Jews did not use last names, they mostly \nused patronymics, places of origin, nicknames or professions. In Yiddish, which was then the \nlingua franca of Krakow Jews, as in German, patronymics took the form of adding an \"s\" at the \nend of father's name. Thus, Israel, the father of the Krakow sage, Reb Moses ben Israel (Remuh, \n1525-1572), was known by his nickname, Isserl. His son became known as Moses Isserls or \nIsserless. In Polish, the comparable term is \"z\", meaning \"of\". Thus, Dobrysz, wife of Jozef \nAleksandrowicz, was listed in the 1818 record of the birth of her son as \"Dobrysz z Jakubow\", i.e. \nDobrysz of the Jacobs. In conformity with the then common Polish usage the father's name could \nalso be used with an ending \"-wicz\".  For example Berek, son of Josel, the leader of the Jewish \nbattalion in Kosciuszko's army, was known as Berek Joselewicz.  His son was Berkowicz. In this \nmanner, Dobrysz Aleksandrowicz, daughter of Jacob Gumple is listed in a document of marriage \nof her daughter, Rywka, in 1831, as Dobrysz z Gumplowiczow, i.e. Dobrysh of the \nGumplowiczes. The Polish word for \"butcher\" is \"rzeznik\".  The butcher's son is referred to, in \nthe 1790 census, as Jebl Rzeznikowicz. A physician's son is known as Doktorowicz. In German or \nYiddish a tailor would be known as Schneider, a carpenter as Tischler, a jeweler as Goldschmidt. \nIn Russian part of Poland the same men would be referred to as Kravetz, Stolar and Zlotnik or \nSlotnick.\n<P>\nIf a Jew from Dresden in Saxony came to Krakow he would be known as Dresdner or Drezner \n(my great-grandmother's maiden name), if he came from Brody he would be referred to as Broder, \nif he came from Frankfurt as Frankfurter. If a Krakow Jew left for Vienna or Berlin he would be \nreferred to, in the Yiddish or German mode, as Krakauer; if he left for Warsaw or St. Petersburg, \nhe might be known, in the Polish or Russian mode, as Krakowski. It is important, however, to \nremember that these were not family names at that point in time, but patronymics or indications of \nprofession or place of origin, although many of them eventually ended up by being adopted as \nsurnames. In the light of the above, I believe that the simplest explanation for the origin of the \nname Aleksandrowicz, first used in 1807, is that of having an ancestor named Alexander.\n<P>\nIn 1787 the Austrian emperor, Jozef II, ordered that all his subjects must have family names. As \nKrakow became Austrian in 1794, Krakow Jews gradually assumed surnames. Those who were \nregistered by Austrian clerks got Germanic names: Goldberg, Schwartzstein, Rosenwald, \nBirnbaum, Bernstein, Feldman, etc. In the birth records that I have consulted in Krakow, \nsurnames began to appear in 1805. The first Jews with surnames that I found were Berl \nLuxenberg, Hillel Rosenzweig and Abraham Anisfeld. The first use of the name Birnbaum (my \ngrandmother's name) occurred in 1806, the first use of Aleksandrowicz (actually \"Alexa...\") in \n1807. How come Jozef Aleksandrowicz, born in 1783, selected or was given such a non-\nGermanic sounding surname, I was not able to establish.\n<P>\nIn the book registering births in the Jewish Town in Kazimierz in the year 1818 Jozef \nAleksandrowicz and Dobrysz, daughter of the Jacobs, had a son, whom they named Samuel Aron. \nThere are no further records of Samuel Aron, but many records of a man who calls himself \nMenashe (Manasse) Aleksandrowicz, who was born on the same date in 1818 and whose mother \nhad the rather rare name of Dobrysz. I am certain that Samuel Aron and Menashe are one and the \nsame individual.  According to the birth certificate (see enclosed copy translated into English) in \n1818 Jozef was thirty four, Dobrysz thirty two years old. They lived in Building 203 in the Jewish \nTown in Kazimierz. In 1821 Jozef and Dobrysz had a second son, Izrael Eliasz. In 1818 they both \nwere rather old to have a first child. When we searched records prior to 1818 we found birth \nrecords of three daughters and, eventually, a record of two more. In 1805 Jozef had a girl named \nSchoendel. In 1807 Jozef \"Alexa...\", living in Building 203 in Kazimierz, had a daughter, \nTemerle. In 1809 another girl, Ryvka, was born, but the record of her birth is missing. We know \nof her existence from her wedding announcement of 1831. In 1811, also in building 203, Josef \nAlexander and Dobrysz, daughter of the Jacobs, had a daughter named Gele, in 1813 another \ndaughter, Hana.\n<P>\nThe first record to mention the name Aleksandrowicz, or something approaching it, occurs in \n1807. The 1807 record is blurred and hard to read, the last name given as Alexa... or Alexe..., the \nwife's name is not Dobrysz but what looks like Freindel. In 1813, 1818 and 1821 this wife is \nlisted as Dobrysz. However, we found a later document, from 1827, where both names are shown \nand she is listed as Freindel Dobrysz. In a still later document, from 1831, she is listed as \n\"Dobress z Gomplowiczow\", i. e. as Dobress of the Gomplowiczes. This establishes that her \nfather was Jacob Gumplowicz. The name Dobrysz was new to me, as was the name Temerle. \nHowever, I found that the name Temerl was fairly popular in the 1800's. Indeed, in mid 1800's a \nnephew of Temerle Aleksandrowicz, Nachman, son of Israel Eliasz, had a daughter whom he \nnamed Temerl.  In the old Jewish cemetery at the Remuh Synagogue there are two tombstones to \nDobrosz or Dobrysz, who died in 1642.  She was the daughter of the famous Krakow cabalist \nNathan Spira (1585-1633).  The Polish word \"dobroc'\", roughly pronounced \"dobrotch\", means \ngoodness. Thus, the name Dobrysz may be a Polish translation of the common Jewish names Gitl \nor Guta. The name Alexander was also rare among Krakow Jews. However, the historian Meyer \nBalaban, in his important book of history of Krakow Jews, shows in the Remuh family tree, that \nRemuh's sister married Alexander ha-Kohen.  Another Alexander appears as the father of one of \nRemuh' students, Joshua Falk ben Alexander ha-Kohen, author of a commentary to Shulkhan \nArukh. In a book on Jewish trade in Krakow in the 15-th and 16-th Century published by the \nKrakow Academy of Arts and Sciences there is a listing of an Aleksander Jozefowicz, i.e. \nAlexander son of Jozef. I have not been able to establish if there is any connection between this \nprominent Cracovian merchant and the subsequent decision, one hundred years later, by Jozef son \nof David to adopt \"Aleksandrowicz\" as his family name.\n<P>\nThere exists a family legend specifying that we are related to Remuh, not descended from, but \nrelated. If we assume that Jewish names repeat themselves every two or three generations, then \nour patriarch Jozef Aleksandrowicz may be a descendant of Alexander Jozefowicz or of the \nAlexander who married Remuh's sister. His wife Dobrysz may be a descendant of Dobrysz, \ndaughter of Nathan Spira. Remuh claimed that he established his descent from Rashi (c.1040-\n1105), the great sage of Troyes, Mainz and Worms. Rashi, in turn, claimed descent from the \nRoyal House of Judah. Allowing for a little poetic license, my ancestor Jozef Aleksandrowicz \nmay have been a descendant of King David.\n<P>\nJozef Aleksandrowicz's son Menashe (1818-<1902) married Lea nee Katzner and had four sons: a \nfirst born named after the deceased founder of the family, Jozef (1845-1940), a second son David, \nwho must have died young because he does not appear in any subsequent documents, a third son \nFeivel (Filip, 1849-1909) and the youngest Wolf (1850-1888).  The three branches of the family \nstem from these three surviving brothers.  The other relatives are descended from Menashe's \nbrother, the first Jozef's other son, Israel Eliasz (1821- ?). The second Jozef Aleksandrowicz, born \nin 1845, grandson and namesake of the first Jozef, married Rachel daughter of Saul Drezner, a \ntavern keeper in Krakow and had three sons and four daughters.  Filip Aleksandrowicz, born in \n1849, married Dorothea, daughter of Jonas Fraenkel, a descendant of the rabbi of Raciborz and \nhad five sons and two daughters.  Wolf Aleksandrowicz married Regina, daughter of Salomon \nHirsch, a tavern keeper in Tarnow, and had two sons and three daughters.  All these cousins. \nexcept one, married into prominent Krakow families and had many children.  While many \nmembers of this and next generation died during the Holocaust, many live today all over the \nworld, in New York, Israel, California, Hawaii, Poland, Argentina, England, and elsewhere.\n<P>\nJozef Aleksandrowicz's son Jacob (1866-1935) established a wholesale leather import/export \nenterprise in Krakow with a branch in Kielce, Poland. Before 1939 this business imported leather \nfrom Czechoslovakia, Germany, England and the United States (from the Allied Kid Company of \nPhiladelphia). Wolf's wife Regina (1853-1940) founded a wholesale-and-retail stationery, paper \ngoods and art supplies store on the corner of Dluga and Basztowa Streets in Krakow that became \nthe premier source for generations of Krakow schoolchildren and young Polish artists. When a \nstruggling artist could not pay for needed sketch paper or other supplies he often received them \nfor free and, in recompense, sketched or painted a portrait of Regina's young daughter, Roza \nAleksandrowicz (1886-1973).  Many such portraits exist, one of them is hanging at the top of the \nstairs leading to the main dining room of the renowned Krakow restaurant Hawelka in Krakow's \nmain square, the Rynek Glowny. Filip's descendants established a mattress factory in Podgorze \nand became major real estate owners in that district.\n<P>\nI remember my great-grandfather Jozef as an old man whom I visited with my father in the \nnineteen thirties. He had to be told which of his many grandchildren is my father. He spoke \nYiddish or German. His oldest son Jacob Aleksandrowicz (1866-1935) was my grandfather. He \nmarried Anna (1866-1923), daughter of Isaac Mendel Birnbaum, sister of the cantor and \ncomposer Eduard Birnbaum (1855-1920), collector of Jewish lithurgical music. Jacob and Anna \nhad five sons and two daughters.  All of them married and had one or two children.  My father \nwas Maksymilian Aleksandrowicz (1902-1968). He married Salomea nee Rubin (1901-1942), \ndaughter of Isaac Rosenberg, son of the Rabbi of Klasno/Wieliczka near Krakow. I was born in \nParis in 1925 where my mother was studying.  After my birth my parents returned to Krakow.  \nMy sister Anna was born in 1931. My father ran the family leather business and was also \npolitically active, running for a seat on the City Council on behalf of the Jewish Labor Bund. In \n1939 my father was drafted into the Polish army and fought the Germans. When the Soviet armies \nback-stabbed Poland from the East, the Polish army disintegrated. My father could not return to \nKrakow where the Gestapo was looking for him and he moved to Vilna and eventually, with the \nhelp of the Jewish Labor Committee, and the Japanese Consul in Lithuania, Sugihara, to New \nYork, where he changed his name to Max Alexander. He remarried in New York, his second wife \nbeing Roza nee Luksemburg. He died in 1968.\n<P>\nMy mother (Salomea Scheindel Aleksandrowicz, nee Rubin) was a pre-school teacher, a follower \nof Maria Montessori. In Krakow, she ran the first Montessori kindergarten. My mother and my \nsister were deported from the Krakow Ghetto in October 1942 to the extermination center in \nBelzec in Poland and never heard from again. I was 14 when the war broke out, having completed \ngrade school  (St. Adalbert School on Biskupia Street) and part of secondary school (the King \nJohn III Sobieski Gimnasium) in Krakow. When the Nazis came the schools were closed. I \nworked at first as a bookbinder trainee and, for a while outside of the Ghetto, as a shoemaker \ntrainee. This latter enabled me to serve as a messenger for the underground, maintaining \ncommunication between Jewish and Polish secret organizations in Krakow (the Jewish Labor \nBund and the WRN branch of the Polish Socialist Party, respectively), carrying and distributing \nsecretly printed leaflets and newspapers. My underground activities have been described in the \nmemoirs of the courageous Jewish Labor Bund courier during the war, Jacob Celemenski, \npublished in New York in 1963.  After March 1943 I was in the Krakow-Plaszow concentration \ncamp. In 1944 I was transferred to the camps in Austria.  Liberated in May 1945 I came to the US \nin 1946, graduated from Hobart College in 1949 and Rutgers University in 1953 with a doctorate \nin chemistry and microbiology.  I abbreviated my name from Jerzy Aleksandrowicz to George \nAlexander.  In 1958 I joined the faculty of Columbia University, became an Associate Professor \nof Biochemical Psychiatry and Chief of a Behavioral Toxicology Laboratory at the New York \nState Psychiatric Institute. I retired in 1992. In 1958 I married Rita, daughter of Sigmund \nBirnbaum of Fuerth in Bavaria and New York and of Sarena nee Feldman of Kisvarda in Hungary \nand New York. We have a son, Mark.\n<P>\nWhen the war broke out in 1939 I had 21 immediate relatives living in Krakow, uncles, aunts, \nfirst cousins. Of these only three survived: myself, my father and my father's oldest brother \nIgnacy. My father and uncle Ignacy came to the US in 1941 through Vilna, the Soviet Union and \nJapan. I survived in the concentration camps. One of my uncles died in Russia. The 17 other \nmembers of my immediate family were killed by the Nazis.  Thus, my family can serve as rebuttal \nto those who claim that the Holocaust never happened.\n<P>\nIn my search for roots in Krakow, I have been able to establish that our family name first \nappeared in official documents in Krakow 192 years ago, at first as \"Alexa\" then as \"Alexander\" \nand eventually, in 1818, as \"Aleksandrowicz\", but I did not find out how it was derived. I have \nbeen able to correlate some events in the history of Krakow, the ancient coronation and burial site \nof Polish kings and a free Krakow Republic (1815-1846), with events in our family, which during \nthe first third of the twentieth century was wealthy and influential in that town. I have found out \nthe exact relationship between the three branches of the family.\n<P>\nThere remain a lot of lacunae in the Aleksandrowicz history and more work needs to be done, \nparticularly in connection with collateral branches.  For example, I have received a family tree of \nmy wife, the Birnbaums from Fuerth in Bavaria, going back to the l6-th century.  My wife's \nmother's family, the Feldmans of Kisvarda in Hungary and Sub-Carpathia, also have a detailed \nfamily history.  My mother's father, Isaac Rosenberg came from Klasno near Wieliczka, a salt-\nmine town near Krakow.  In Krakow, my grandmother's people, also named Birnbaum (a \ncoincidence?) lived and prospered, as have the relatives of my great-grandmother, the Drezners. \nOther family names, related to ours are (in alphabetical order): Bader, Bal, Blonder, Chelouche, \nDavidson, Fallick, Frisch, Groner, Gumplowicz, Herrstein, Infeld, Jezower, Kaufer, \nKleinhaendler, Klipper, Luksemburg, Mercado, Mikolajewicz, Muller, Neuger, Neuman, \nObersky, Pitzele, Polenz, Queller, Rakower, Rosenberg, Schall, Schmerler, Schoenfeld, \nShimshowitz, Spatz, Spritzer, Steinberg, Steiner, Szymanski, Uberall, Wayne, Weindling, \nWeinberg, Weinstein, Weinstock, Wien, and Zeliger.
