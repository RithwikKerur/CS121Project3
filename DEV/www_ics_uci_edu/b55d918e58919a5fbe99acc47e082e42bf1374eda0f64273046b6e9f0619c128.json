Understanding.</B></P>\n\n<P>Placing this subject in the title was a way to tell you that one of\nyour major tasks for the current period of time is developing an understanding\nof the various technologies and tasks concerned wiht your project. This\nincludes the tools and techniques that you will use in accomplishing your\ntask as well as the technologies that you will be extending/enhancing/changing.</P>\n\n<P>In this deliverable you should reflect your newly gained by writing\nan intrduction to your project that highlights the important points. It\nshould also include</P>\n\n<P>* Sales Brochure - To describe your product to any outside audience.</P>\n\n<P>*Description of activities done in support of understanding - like interviews\nwith the customer, for example.</P>\n\n<P>Hint: One of the best ways to gain an understanding, or re-engineering\nof a piece of software is to interview the original developer.</P>\n\n<P><B>2.Project Plan</B></P>\n\n<P>You could use a tool like Microsoft Project to help you with this task.</P>\n\n<P>I Introduction</P>\n\n<UL>\n<UL>\n<P>A.

Tracking and Control Mechanisms</P>\n\n<P>VIII. Appendices</P>\n\n<P>\n<HR WIDTH=\"100%\"></P>\n\n<P>As seen above, apart from specifying the team structure (manager, secretary\netc.), write the technology specification, i.e. have for each technology\nthat you described in your understanding section, one person who is going\nto be the team expert in that technology.Similar to how the team organisation\nprovides an internal or external contact point for resolving issues with\nrespect to yoru project, the technology chart provides an internal or external\ncontact point for who is the point man for each technology. </P>\n\n<P>These are the deliverables for the first phase.</P>\n\n<P>\n<HR WIDTH=\"100%\"></P>\n\n<P><B>Requirements &amp; Documentation ( Second Phase)</B></P>\n\n<P><B>Requirements</B></P>\n\n<P>This of course , is the full description of what you are going to do.\nYou've done these before, in ICS 52 and ICS 121, so you have plenty of\n&quot;model documents&quot; to draw from, to help you determine how to\nstructure this statement. Keep in mind that key objectives of a requirements\ndocument are</P>\n\n<P>(1) Completeness -- everything is described<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\n(2) Understandability -- the &quot;customer&quot; can read it and be convinced\nthat all his objectives and needs are adequately and accurately described.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\n(3) Utility -- the information in the document can be used effectively\nto help in the design phase (eg. an OO requirements analysis can aid in\ndevelopment of an OO design)<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\n(4) No Ambiguity -- every reader will come away with some understanding.<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\n(5) Consistency -- No contradictions</P>\n\n<P>Use diagrams of course , to help give appropriate overviews and understanding.\nNote that pictures may well be an essential element of the complete description\nof any graphical inetrface. You could use story board techniques to present\nusage scenarios.</P>\n\n<P><B>Documentation</B></P>\n\n<P>This section is reserved for documentation you have developed during\nthis phase of the project. Specifically, if during the course of developing\nthe your understanding of the various technologies involved in the porject,\nyou discovered items that were not documented, but which were important,\nthen you should include that here.</P>\n\n<P>Aditionally you should list here the major sources of information that\nyou will be using during the remainder of the project.</P>\n\n<P>0. Introduction</P>\n\n<P>Expand your introduction to discuss your specific approaches to the\ndesign of the system.</P>\n\n<P>1. Understanding</P>\n\n<P>This will basically be the same as in your previous document. Make sure\nyou describe what steps or actions you took to understand each technology\nor software. If you make changes to this section, add text describing why\nthe change was necessary, and why it more accurately reflects your new\nunderstanding.</P>\n\n<P>2. Project Plan</P>\n\n<P>This will be an iterative expansion of your previous section.Expand\nyour project plan to represent how you have accomplished the work so far.\nExpand your task network or work breakdown structure to the level of detail\nneeded to complete this task. Based on the work you have done, revise your\nestimates on how much your team can accomplish and deliver. If you make\nchanges, add text describing why the change was necessary or why it will\nimprove the ability of your team to accomplish the work you have proposed.</P>\n\n<P>3. Requirements</P>\n\n<P>This will basically be the same as in your previous document. If any\nrequirements are changed, added or deleted, make this explicit. Describe\nwhy the requirement was changed/added/deleted and by whom ( customer, developer,\netc. ). Again make sure your requirements meet the objectives of completeness,\nunderstandbility, utility, no ambiguity, consistency.</P>\n\n<P>4. Architecture/Module Specifications</P>\n\n<UL>\n<P>I.

Each team member <B>must\n</B>fill out a team/peer appraisal packet. These packets are dure on the\nfinal day of your presentation. All students must email this completed\nform to both taylor@ics.uci.edu and rema@ics.uci.edu to receive a grade\nfor the class.</P>\n\n<P>Please divide 100 points between your teammates according to their level\nof participation in your team's project. Do not assign any points to yourself\n-- just to your team members. If you feel all members have contributed\nequally, then assign each team member 33.3 points ( assuming there are\nfour members). If on the other hand, if you feel that one member did far\nmore work than all others and one member was not helpful, you might give\nthe more active member 45 points, the less active member 20 points , and\nthe other member 35 points. Please try to be fair.</P>\n\n<P>Also comment <B>briefly</B> on each team member's performance. Your\nevaluation should focus on standard evaluation criteria, such as technical\ncompetence, effort, productivity, creativity, quality, dependability, communication,\ninitiative, decision making, and leadership.</P>\n\n<P>Please assign a number between 1-5, 1 being worst, 5 being best for\neach teammate, for each attribute.</P>\n\n<P>competence : possesses or seeks required knowledge<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nEffort : tries to accomplish assigned tasks<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nProductivity : level of work generated<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nCreativity : conceptualised usful, innovativce approaches<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nQuality : demonstrates accuracy and thoroughness<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nDependability : follows through on responsibilities<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nCommunication : listens, expresses ideas/concepts<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nInitiative : seeks out new assignments<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nDecision Making : sets objectives, evaluates alternatives<BR CLEAR=BOTH>\nLeadership : fosters good teamwork, solves team problems</P>\n\n<P>Your Name :</P>\n\n<P>1.
