More specifically, we prove NP-completeness for\nbiconnected planar graphs with $\\Delta\\ge 7$ and we extend the algorithm for\npartial 2-trees to a linear-time algorithm for simply-connected planar\ngraphs with $\\Delta\\le 6$. The latter algorithmic result is based on\ndecomposing the input graph into its triconnected components via\nSPQR-trees and on handling the complexity of the rigid components by\nmeans of a small set of reduction rules. Interestingly, we show that the\nalgorithmic core of the problem can be tackled by means of Turing\nreductions to special instances of NAESAT that can be solved in linear\ntime.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on joint work with Giordano Da Lozzo and Michael T.
