Silicon? Yes folks it was bound to happen sooner\nthan later.  Today man has decided to store his a==\n\nrt not on canvas but disk.  Welcome to the future of art in the 21st\ncentury.  Looking ahead we have seen our\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Magazines/\">magazines</A>,\n<A HREF=\"gopher://wiretap.spies.com/11/Books\">books</A>,\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.iuma.com/\">music</A> and <A\nHREF=\"http://ea.oac.uci.edu/indiv/eafg026/images/o.j.stamp3.gif\">pictures</A>\nthat define the human existence go digital.  In fact almost every media\nimaginable has now gone the ways of the cyber-community.  Gone are our\nthe\n\nconventions that would limit our access to art,\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.yahoo.com/Science/\">science</A> and\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.yahoo.com/Government/\">government</A>.  People\nworldwide now gather across phone lines and push buttons that inject\nthe new messia\n\nh.  A digital homage to a Mecca that is continually growing upward to\nan infinite sky.  This new genre has entered our society with a\nvehemence of unwreakening strength.  Man in the last four years has\ninvented another Atomic Bomb, and it's buttons lie wi\n\nth in Browsers such as\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu\">Mosaic</A> and\n\n<A HREF=\"http://home.mcom.com\">Netscape</A>.  This time we are\n<U>all</U> under attack.\n\n<P>\n\nArt has been the one true universal element in all human societies.\nWith the\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.memst.edu/egypt/main.html\">Egyptians</A> it was a\nway of recording events and honoring the memories of the dead.  With\nthe Greeks and\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Experimenta\">Romans</A> art became a decorative element\nthat enhanced daily life.  In\n\n<A\nHREF=\"http://www.twi.tudelft.nl/Local/Shona/Sculpture.html\">Africa</A>\nas in many tribal communities art was a way to worship gods and\ndeities.  In fac==\n\nt since the dawn of man, art expressed mans creative desire and\ndepiction for beauty and tranquillity.  Much is the same with our\nmodern society as it was millions of years ago.  The difference now\nbeing the format not the purpose.\n\n<P>\n\nWith the advent of the\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html\">World Wide\nWeb</A>, art is expressed though in-line images of a\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ziff.com/~pcmag/1403/03webin\">Browser</A>, stored\nin universal compression formats such as\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/us\">GIF, JPEG and\nMPEG</A>.  It is here that a new definition is being mapped out for art\nand its role in a computer based society.  In this new art world\neveryone who has access can be seen while new i\n\ndeas are inputted and updated constantly.\n\nI first became aware of this new cyberbased art world one year ago when\nI ran across the\n\n<A HREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS/\" >Otis\nProject</a> on the Web.  It was here that the interactive nature of\ncomputing was being retrofitt\n\ned into an art context.  I quickly took the opportunity to take some\nscanned photos and paintings I had worked on, and then uploaded them to\nthe site.  It was through my newly acquired audience reactions that I\ndeveloped an interest in the potential of\n\n<A\n\nHREF=\"http://www.monash.edu.au/diva/images.html\">digital</A> art.  It\nwas then that I dove into the ideas surrounding\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.art.net:80/\">art on the net</A>.  Quickly, I\ndiscovered that I was now an information provider.  This newly acquired\n\ntitle forced me to think of the social responsibility as well as the\nimplications that the new technology has upon society.  In this new age\neveryone involved is an artist and critic.  The range of images and\ninformation is unfathomable.  Navigating to w==\n\neb site museums had become a long time consuming quest for art.\nLuckily for artists\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.nas.nasa.gov/HPCC/K12/EDRC29.html\">search\nengines</A> cut most of the time required to find art based Web sites.\n\n<A HREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Art\">Yahoo</a> is a good starting location for hunting down Web\nGalleries.  It's here that one can find a listing of many\n\n<A\nHREF=\"http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjfg/gallery.html\">commercial</A>\n\n<A HREF=\"http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/annenberg/artgals2.html\">galleries</A> as well as\n\n<A HREF=\"http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjfg/nonprofit\">non-profit</A>\ngalleries.  Most\n\n<A\nHREF=\"http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/public/cfaInfo/univG\">Universities</A>\nhave now joined the Web bringing student work (that might\n\nbe limited to a particular campus) on-line.\n\n<P>\n\nStill, if this new technology was to have any implications in\nrevolutionizing the existing art world, it would need to reference it.\nThe\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.si.edu/\">Smithsonian Institute</A> site is one that\nexemplifies how an old establishment is willin g to modernize.  If one\nwas interested in viewing art of the\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.emf.net/louvre/paint/theme/im\">impressionists</A>\nor the\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.emf.net/louvre/paint/\">Great Masters</A> a trip to\nthe Luovre no longer requires getting on a pla==\n\nne to Europe.\n\n<P>\n\nUnfortunately the Web has its limitations.  It can never replace the\noriginal work nor can it represent the environment on feels when in a\ngallery or museum.  What the Web lacks it makes up for with\nconvenience.  In most cases a gallery visitor might not\n\nhave time or money to venture to visit a friends show.  With a Web\ngallery one can still visit and see their friends work in this case\nlets say\n\n<A\nHREF=\"http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/public/oratGallery/artsExhibits/bowenExhibit3/home.html\">Greg\nBowen</A>\n\nfrom the\n\n<A\nHREF=\"http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/public/cfaInfo/univGallery/Galleries.html\">Illinois\nState University</A>.  By clicking the hypertext document I just saved\nmyself a trip across the country to view pictures of his girlfriends\nnavel piercing.\n\n\n\n<P>\n\nThe real test of this computer based renaissance will be in research.\nThis field offers archeologists as well as art historians to a myriad\nof files and images stored on the net.  Commercial implications aside.\nThis type of research might replace the th\n\nousands of journals in the libraries across the world.  For example. A\nsubject calls for a study on\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.memphis.edu/egypt/artifact.html\">Egyptian art</A>\nduring the Middle Kingdom period. One only needs to access a site in\nMemphis. In fact\n\nthe longer one pursues the subject art and artifacts from around the\n\n<A HREF=\"http://sgwww.epfl.ch/BERGER/\">world</A> can be found and\nbrought into the home via the WWW.\n\nArt enters our computer driven society though other sources besides the\nWWW.  In the form of\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.primenet.com/~laig/cdrom.html\">CD-ROM</A>,\nhundreds of images can be placed on Compact Disk.  This type of\npackaging unfortunately requires a\n\ncertain type of platform in order to run, are not as interactive as the\nWWW (also they can be <U>very</U> expensive).  I have found that the\nWWW is the only viable solution to the computer driven art community.\nLow costs and a never ending data bank of\n\ninformation will propel the 21st century artist into the future.\nUnfortunately the ride will not be smooth.\n\n<P>\n\nUntil recently the images found on the internet went unchallenged.  Art\nno matter what its content could be distributed world wide.  In some\nessence it was the last place an artist could express his/her ideas\nwith out censorship imposed upon their work.\n\nNow, as in most anarchy's, the art and images found on the net are\nbeing challenged by government on its content.  The issues of\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/~jjrk1/porno.html\">pornography vs.\nartistic vision</A> will again be brought into the political\n\nareana, as the numbers of WWW traffic increases.  A nude study such as\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.atom.co.jp/GALLERY/PICTURE/Osawa\">Hisayoshi\nOsawa's</A> might be compared to images found on\n\n<A HREF=\"http://www.playboy.com/\">Playboy Internet</A>.  I believe if\n\nrestrictions are placed upon art, it cannot exist in its true virtue.\nIt is a difficult issue to approach and has no real solution except to\neducated the viewers in the differences in the meanings.  Judging from\nexperience Art has always challenged censo==\n\nr ideals and has prevailed, even in a conservative society.\n\n<P>\n\nWhat the future holds in the art world is still being shaped.  It is\nquite possible that this technology is a trend and it will pass with\nthe new and improved technology.  I feel some of the concepts mentioned\nabove are to stay.  Twenty years ago a digita==\n\nl media based society was unimaginable to the public, today it is\ninconceivable to live without it.  From our televisions to our laptops,\nwe rely on the information we obtain.  Art is connected to this\ninformation society, from it we get the pictures and\n\nthe sounds that shape cultures.  Today the world is united in this new\nkingdom of silicon.  It is here that art can truly progress into a\nwonderful arena of ideas that can be viewed by all.\n\nThe WWW is the key that, for now, unlocks the doors to the world's\nfamily album.  Sven Wechsler a student from the University of Colorado\ncommented on the value of art on the Internet. He jests \"The Louvre\nisn't exactly across the street.\"  Today it is.\n\n\n<P>\n<hr><p>\n<B><U><H3>References:</H3></U></B><!DOCTYPEHotlist-file-1>   \n    <A HREF=\"http://www.egallery.com/egallery/\">The Electric Gallery</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://sfgate.com/gallery/\">The Gate Gallery</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.si.edu/\" >Smithsonian</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ncb.gov.sg/wired/WoWWW.html\" >Wired Magazine</A>\n\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.playboy.com/\">The Playboy Home Page</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.atom.co.jp/GALLERY/PICTURE/Osawa/index.html\">Hisayoshi Osawa #1</A>\n   <A HREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/\">Yahoo</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://nyweb.com/expo/\">EXPO AT NYC WEB</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/annenberg/artfinal.html\">Not Waiting for the Information Highway: Art Galleries on the World Wide Web</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://wimsey.com/anima/NEXUS/makingArt.html\">MAKING ART ONLINE</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.mojones.com/motherjones.html\">Mother Jones</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.atom.co.jp/\">atom Co.,Ltd. home page</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.wired.com/Staff/justin/dox/sex.html\">Sex</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://golgi.harvard.edu/biopages/all.html\">The World-Wide Web Virtual Library: Biosciences</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.mgainc.com/Art/jsd/vargas/av_list.html\">The Artwork of Alberto Vargas on Access Art</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.iuma.com/\">Internet Underground Music Archive</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.einet.net/\">EINet Galaxy</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/\">The Lycos Home Page: Hunting WWW Information</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html\">World Wide Web FAQ</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Magazines/\">Entertainment:Magazines</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Music/\">Entertainment:Music</A>\n   <A HREF=\"http://webcrawler.cs.washington.edu/WebCrawler/WebQuery.html\">WebCrawler Searching</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.cs.indiana.edu/aliweb/form.html\" ADD_DATE=\"-1419249758\" ALIWEB Search Form</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.online.edu/index.htm\">OnLine Education Home Page</A>\n    <A HREF=\"gopher://wiretap.spies.com/11/Books\">Books</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~ian/ianres.html\">The World-Wide Web Virtual Library: Research Resources</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.nas.nasa.gov/HPCC/K12/EDRC29.html\">Search Pages and Resource Discovery Engines</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://heiwww.unige.ch/art >Art Gallery - Home</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/websearch.html\">Searching the Web</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.uky.edu/Artsource/artsourcehome.html\">ArtSource</A>\n   <A HREF=\"http://agent2.lycos.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/pursuit?galleries.\">Lycos search: galleries.</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/public/cfaInfo/univGallery/Galleries.html\" >University Galleries</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.uampfa.berkeley.edu/\">University Art Museum / Pacific Film Archive</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/annenberg/artgals2.html\">List of Art Galleries</A>\n   <A HREF=\"http://www.mgainc.com/Art/By_Artist.html\">Access Art, Artists On Line</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.egallery.com/egallery/homepage.html\">The Electric Gallery</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://orathost.cfa.ilstu.edu/public/cfaInfo/univGallery/Galleries.html\">University Galleries</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/aliweb.pl?query=egyptian+art&searchtype=Substring&types=Any&titlefield=on&descriptionfield=on&keywordfield=on&showdescription=on&domain=&hits=\">Search Results for 'egyptian art'</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.memphis.edu/egypt/artifact.html\" >Egyptian Artifacts Exhibit</A>\n  <A HREF=\"http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjfg/nonprofit.html\" >Non-Profit Galleries</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjfg/gallery.html\">Commercial: Galleries</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://sgwww.epfl.ch/BERGER/\">World Art Treasures</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.york.ac.uk/~jjrk1/porno.html\">Porn and the Sexual Aesthetic of the Net</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://bcn.boulder.co.us/campuspress/feb31995/gallery020395.html\" >On-line Gallery 2/3/95</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://nearnet.gnn.com/wic/art.toc.html\">Arts & Entertainment</A>\n    <A HREF=\"http://www.emf.net/louvre/paris/tour/louvre.inside.html\">WebMuseum: Inside Le Louvre</A>\n   <A HREF=\"http://www.micro.umn.edu/weisman/Exhibits/ExhibitsJPG.html\">Frederick R.
