The JCP produces high-quality specifications in \"Internet\r\ntime\" using an inclusive, consensus building approach that produces a specification,\r\na reference implementation (to prove the specification can be implemented),\r\nand a technology compatibility kit (a suite of tests, tools, and documentation\r\nthat is used to test implementations for compliance with the specification). \r\n</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Experience has shown that the best\r\nway to produce a technology specification is to gather a group of industry\r\nexperts who have a deep understanding of the technology in question and then\r\nhave a strong technical lead work with that group to create a first draft.\r\nConsensus around the form and content of the draft is then built using an\r\niterative review process that allows an ever-widening audience to review\r\nand comment on the document. </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">This version of the JCP was developed\r\nby Sun based on input from leading Java partners. In this version, an Executive\r\nCommittee (EC) representing a cross-section of both major stakeholders and\r\nother members of the Java community is responsible for approving the passage\r\nof specifications through key points of the JCP and for reconciling discrepancies\r\nbetween specifications and their associated test suites. There are two ECs:\r\none to oversee the Java technologies for the desktop/server space (with responsibility\r\nfor the J2SE&#8482; and J2EE&#8482; specifications) and the other to oversee the Java\r\ntechnologies for the consumer/embedded space (with responsibility for the\r\nJ2ME&#8482; specification). </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">There are four major steps in this version of the JCP:\r\n</font></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">\t<li><b>INITIATION</b>: A specification\r\ntargeted at the desktop/server or consumer/embedded space is initiated by\r\ncommunity member(s) and approved for development by the responsible EC.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t</li><li><b>COMMUNITY DRAFT</b>\r\n: A group of experts is formed to develop a first draft of the specification\r\nthat both the community and the responsible EC will then review. The expert\r\ngroup uses feedback from the review to revise and refine the draft. At the\r\nend of the review, the responsible EC decides if the draft should proceed\r\nto the next step.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t</li><li><b>PUBLIC DRAFT</b>: The draft goes\r\nout for review by the public where anyone with an Internet connection can\r\nread and comment on the draft. The expert group uses the public feedback\r\nto further revise the document. Finally, the leader of the expert group sees\r\nthat the reference implementation and its associated technology compatibility\r\nkit are completed before sending the specification to the responsible EC\r\nfor final approval.<br><br>\r\n\r\n\t</li><li><b>MAINTENANCE</b>: The completed\r\nspecification, reference implementation, and technology compatibility kit\r\nare updated in response to ongoing requests for clarification, interpretation,\r\nenhancements, and revisions. The responsible EC can review all proposed changes\r\nto the specification and indicate which ones can be carried out immediately\r\nand which will require the specification to be revised by an expert group.\r\nChallenges to one or more tests in a specification's technology compatibility\r\nkit are ultimately decided by the responsible EC if they cannot be otherwise\r\nresolved. </li></font></ol>\r\n\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><a name=\"F\"></a>\r\n\r\n<font size=\"+2\">FUNDAMENTAL DEFINITIONS</font><a href=\"#top\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"Java-Community-Process_files/back-to-top.gif\" width=\"12\" height=\"21\" hspace=\"3\" alt=\"Return to Top\"></a></font><p>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><b>Java Community Process (JCP)</b>: The formal process described in this document for developing or revising Java technology specifications.\r\n</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><b>Java Community Process Member (Member)</b>: A company, organization, or individual that has signed the JSPA and is abiding by its terms. \r\n</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><b>Java Specification Participation Agreement (JSPA)</b>\r\n: A one-year renewable agreement between Sun Microsystems and a company,\r\norganization or individual that allows the latter entities to participate\r\nin the Java Community Process. </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><b>Individual Expert Participation Agreement (IEPA)</b>\r\n: An agreement between Sun Microsystems and an individual that allows that\r\nindividual to serve on an Expert Group at the invitation of the Specification\r\nLead.

The JSR should follow the\r\ntemplate available at the JCP Web Site. The JSR serves to identify the Members\r\nmaking the request (the sponsors), a Specification Lead, and the initial\r\nmembers of the Expert Group. It will also describe the proposed Specification,\r\nthe reason(s) for developing or revising it, the primary target Java Platform\r\nEdition, an estimated development schedule, and any preexisting documents,\r\ntechnology descriptions, or implementations that might be used as a starting\r\npoint. Any JSR under consideration can be withdrawn by its sponsors without\r\nexplanation at any time prior to the completion of the JSR approval vote\r\n(see section 1.3) upon request by the initiator(s) to the PMO. </font></p>\r\n\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><a name=\"1.1.1\"><h4>1.1.1 REVISE EXISTING SPECIFICATIONS</h4></a>\r\n\r\n</font><p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Existing Specifications, along with\r\ntheir associated RIs and TCKs, are maintained by a designated Maintenance\r\nLead using the processes described in section 4 of this document.

This means that\r\na Maintenance Lead will automatically be the Spec Lead for all significant\r\nrevisions to their Specification going forward but he or she will not have\r\nthe exclusive right to decide when a significant revision will take place.\r\nThat will be decided by the EC in response to a revision JSR that can be\r\ninitiated by any Java Community Member (or Members).

For example, different\r\ncategories of devices may need different subsets of the \"java.net\" package.\r\nIn order to accommodate this, no fundamental restrictions are placed upon\r\nthe number of times or ways in which J2SE/J2EE functionality can be packaged\r\ninto J2ME Building Blocks. </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Building Blocks can be proposed in\r\na UJSR for the J2ME Specification. However, it is recognized that the consumer\r\nand device marketplaces can change very rapidly in comparison to the desktop\r\nand server marketplaces. The definition of new Building Blocks (as well as\r\nthe revision of existing blocks) may need to be carried out very quickly\r\nin order for some J2ME Profiles to keep up with changing market needs. In\r\nthe interest of speed, J2ME Building Blocks may also be defined and revised\r\nwithin the JCP Maintenance Cycle (see section 4.2) for the J2ME Specification.\r\n </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">Expert Groups that need to quickly\r\ncreate or update a J2ME Building Block should approach the Maintenance Lead\r\nfor the J2ME Platform Edition Specification with their requests. The J2ME\r\nMaintenance Lead, after consultation with both the J2ME Expert Group and\r\nthe Maintenance Lead(s) of the Platform Edition(s) the block is to be derived\r\nfrom, may propose the new Building Block as part of a maintenance update\r\nto the J2ME specification. Note that the EC can require any Building Block\r\nproposed as part of the Maintenance Cycle to be defined in a major revision\r\nto the J2ME Specification (see section 4.2.2). </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">If the Maintenance Lead declines\r\na Building Block request, the requesting Expert Group has the options of\r\ninitiating a UJSR for J2ME (which may be time consuming) or creating the\r\nneeded APIs in any namespace not reserved for use by existing Platform Edition\r\nSpecifications.  </font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">In exceptional circumstances, the\r\nJ2ME Specification may define J2ME Building Blocks for use with special classes\r\nof devices that can only implement subsets of the Java virtual machine or\r\nlanguage Specifications. Such Building Blocks can be defined and approved\r\nonly within a UJSR for J2ME. They cannot be defined using the Maintenance\r\nCycle because proposals for Building Blocks for these special classes of\r\ndevices must be subject to the widest possible review. </font></p>\r\n\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><a name=\"1.2\"></a>\r\n</font><h3><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">1.2 JSR REVIEW</font></h3>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><b>definition - JSR Review</b>: A 14 day period when anyone with an Internet connection can review and comment on a new JSR.\r\n</font></p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"><b>definition - JSR Page</b>: Each initiated JSR will be published on a public area of the JCP Web Site.\r\n</font></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">When a JSR is received, the PMO will\r\ngive it a tracking number, assign the JSR to the appropriate EC, create its\r\nJSR Page, announce the proposed JSR to the public, and begin JSR Review.\r\nComments on the JSR should be sent to the e-mail address listed on the JSR\r\nPage.
