Though there are many algorithms that can list all maximal cliques, there is no algorithm which is sufficient for large, sparse graphs in practice. Specifically, those algorithms that are designed for sparse graphs are slow, and those algorithms that are fast in practice require an adjacency matrix, which limits their use to small graphs. In this talk, I will describe a new algorithm for listing all maximal cliques that has a near-optimal running time, and works well in practice for large, sparse graphs.\n</p>\n<p>\n\nThis is joint work with David Eppstein and Maarten Loffler. \n\n</p>\n<p>\nThese results appeared in ISAAC 2010 ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-17517-6_36 ) and SEA 2011 ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20662-7_31 ). \n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
