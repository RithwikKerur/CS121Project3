Today we\nhave names that aren't part of a centralized namespace. Should other applications\nuse your model, like News, etc.?\n<p><b>Cliff Neuman:&nbsp; </b>Prospero used messaging as a test bed. We\nhave a message id to ensure the messages are the same; messages can get\ndelivered to people who are not connected. When email is delivered, may\nnot know who the other recipient is, or where it is placed. It may not\nidentify which mailboxes it goes into. The situation with regard to mail\nvs news is different -- with news, you have a shared mailbox, and with\nmail you don't have a shared mailbox.&nbsp; The shared mailbox is easier\nto deal with, but the system should be able to execute properly for both\nof these situations.\n<p><b>Bill Washburn:</b>&nbsp; In the disconnected case, I see problems.\n... mutually disconnected nodes?\n<p><b>Cliff Neuman:</b> I can see this -- sometimes you don't want to be\nreached.&nbsp; You don't always want to have the service to any node.&nbsp;\nYou may not want the message forwarded.&nbsp; I would want to have update\navailable, but the system should have enough information available to let\nit be delivered.\n<p><b>Bill Washburn:</b> This is a different level of decentralization\nthan I had thought of. No authentication seems to be present.\n<p><b>Cliff Neuman: </b>What is needed is a strengenthing of access control.\nEmail authentication right now comes from a signle channel.&nbsp; There\nis an opportunity to strengthen this, and change it to add access control\nlists, and add policies to individual mailboxes.&nbsp; Security needs are\nbuilt into Prospero.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
