Kay</A>,\n5056 Donald Bren Hall.  Stop by any time, or send electronic mail to &quot;<code>kay</code>&quot;.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<B>Meeting time and place:</B>  Fridays,\n1:00 to 2:50 p.m. in room ICS 180.  As a two-unit class, ICS 398A will meet\nfor about 15 hours in total.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<B>Enrollment information:</B>  All new or\nprospective ICS teaching assistants are required to attend ICS 398A, which\nis offered this year only in the fall quarter.  It&#39;s ideal to\ntake ICS 398 in the first quarter you&#39;re actually teaching, although that isn&#39;t\nalways possible. But if you know you won't be teaching until next year, you could wait until then.</FONT></P>\n<P>\nICS 398B, the Advanced TA Seminar, is offered\nsome years in the spring quarter.  ICS 398B covers such issues as designing\nassignments, exams, and courses, assigning grades, and other issues in running\nyour own course; it is valuable for everyone, and required for TAs who may\nwish to teach their own classes (as many grad students do in summer session\nor through University Extension, not to mention in their own academic jobs).\n You  may take ICS 398B later\nin your career, but you must complete it before you can be appointed as\nan instructor in summer session or Extension.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<B>Course requirements:</B>  This seminar\nis not designed to impose a time burden on the participants beyond the class\nmeetings themselves.  Grading is satisfactory/unsatisfactory or pass/not-pass,\nand we ask only that you attend the meetings, participate in the discussions\nand activities, give one or two short presentations on material you expect\nto be teaching, and arrange through the campus <a href=\"http://www.tltc.uci.edu/\">Teaching, Learning &amp; Technology Center</a>\n(x46188) to be videotaped in your class (whichever quarter you will be teaching).</FONT></P>\n<P>Any benefit you get from this course (unlike most computer science classes, but like most seminars) comes from the in-class discussions and activities. We expect everyone to attend every meeting; that's not asking very much. You may have to miss a meeting (e.g., because you have to travel to a conference), but missing more than one will not be looked on favorably. Please check your calendar for the rest of the quarter and resolve any conflicts now.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<B>Topics to be covered:</B>  In a seminar\nlike this, the topics don&#39;t all come in a predetermined order.  Over\nthe course of the quarter we will cover the following, and more:  motivating\nstudents, teaching techniques and styles, grading exams and assignments,\ndealing with cheating and problem students, working with faculty, departmental\nand university policies.  Most of our time will be devoted to discussion\nand hands-on participatory activities.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<B>Approximate course schedule: </B></FONT>\n</p><TABLE WIDTH=100% border=\"1\" CELLPADDING=1 cellspacing=\"0\">\n<COL WIDTH=13% /><COL WIDTH=17% /><COL WIDTH=70% />\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 0<BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>3 October\n  </TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>\nIntroductions and overview of university teaching</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 1</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP> 10 October\n<BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>TA presentations and presentation strategies</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 2</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n  17 October</FONT><BR />\n  </TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>\nTA presentations </FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 3</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n24 October</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>TA presentations</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 4</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>31 October</font></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>Grading policies, practices, philosophies</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 5</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>7 November</TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>Exam grading</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 6</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n14 November</FONT></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>Grading students&#39; programs and projects<BR />\n     Preventing and detecting academic dishonesty\n</FONT></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% height=\"27\" VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 7</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n21 November</FONT></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>Motivation, problem students, teaching styles </TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% height=\"27\" VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 8</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP>\n28 November</FONT></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>&mdash; HOLIDAY &mdash;</TD>\n</TR>\n<TR>\n<TD WIDTH=13% height=\"27\" VALIGN=TOP>\nWeek 9</FONT><BR /></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=17% VALIGN=TOP> 5 December\n</FONT></TD>\n<TD WIDTH=70% VALIGN=TOP>Epilogue and looking ahead</TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE>\n<BR />\n<B>Quick resource guide:</B></FONT>\n<P>\n<!--If you don&#39;t have an assigned office (or\nprefer not to hold your scheduled office hours there), you may use a designated\nroom in the Computer Science Trailer (where the ICS Student Affairs Office\nis).
