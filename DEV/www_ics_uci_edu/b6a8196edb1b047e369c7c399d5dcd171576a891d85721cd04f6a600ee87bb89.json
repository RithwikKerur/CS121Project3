Italiano (STOC 2003, pp.159-166)\n<br>\npresented by Jonathan Sun\n</h2>\n<p>\nWe study novel combinatorial properties of graphs that allow us to\ndevise a completely new approach to dynamic all pairs shortest paths\nproblems. Our approach yields a fully dynamic algorithm for general\ndirected graphs with non-negative real-valued edge weights that\nsupports any sequence of operations in\n<I>O</I>(<I>n</I><sup>2</sup>poly(log&nbsp;<I>n</I>)) amortized\ntime per update and unit worst-case time per distance query, where n\nis the number of vertices. We can also report shortest paths in\noptimal worst-case time. These bounds improve substantially over\nprevious results and solve a long-standing open problem. Our algorithm\nis deterministic and uses simple data structures.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
