This application\r\nnot only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes\r\nbut is also a starting point for writing your application.\r\n\r\nThis file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that\r\nmake up your Game application.\r\n\r\nGame.h\r\n    This is the main header file for the application.  It includes other\r\n    project specific headers (including Resource.h) and declares the\r\n    CGameApp application class.\r\n\r\nGame.cpp\r\n    This is the main application source file that contains the application\r\n    class CGameApp.\r\n\r\nGame.rc\r\n    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the\r\n    program uses.  It includes the icons, bitmaps, and cursors that are stored\r\n    in the RES subdirectory.  This file can be directly edited in Microsoft\r\n\tDeveloper Studio.\r\n\r\nres\\Game.ico\r\n    This is an icon file, which is used as the application's icon.  This\r\n    icon is included by the main resource file Game.rc.\r\n\r\nres\\Game.rc2\r\n    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft \r\n\tDeveloper Studio.  You should place all resources not\r\n\teditable by the resource editor in this file.\r\n\r\nGame.clw\r\n    This file contains information used by ClassWizard to edit existing\r\n    classes or add new classes.  ClassWizard also uses this file to store\r\n    information needed to create and edit message maps and dialog data\r\n    maps and to create prototype member functions.\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nFor the main frame window:\r\n\r\nMainFrm.h, MainFrm.cpp\r\n    These files contain the frame class CMainFrame, which is derived from\r\n    CFrameWnd and controls all SDI frame features.\r\n\r\nres\\Toolbar.bmp\r\n    This bitmap file is used to create tiled images for the toolbar.\r\n    The initial toolbar and status bar are constructed in the\r\n    CMainFrame class.  Edit this toolbar bitmap along with the\r\n    array in MainFrm.cpp to add more toolbar buttons.\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nAppWizard creates one document type and one view:\r\n\r\nGameDoc.h, GameDoc.cpp - the document\r\n    These files contain your CGameDoc class.  Edit these files to\r\n    add your special document data and to implement file saving and loading\r\n    (via CGameDoc::Serialize).\r\n\r\nGameView.h, GameView.cpp - the view of the document\r\n    These files contain your CGameView class.\r\n    CGameView objects are used to view CGameDoc objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\nOther standard files:\r\n\r\nStdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp\r\n    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file\r\n    named Game.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.\r\n\r\nResource.h\r\n    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.\r\n    Microsoft Developer Studio reads and updates this file.\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\nAppWizard uses \"TODO:\" to indicate parts of the source code you\r\nshould add to or customize.\r\n\r\nIf your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, and your application is \r\nin a language other than the operating system's current language, you\r\nwill need to copy the corresponding localized resources MFC40XXX.DLL\r\nfrom the Microsoft Visual C++ CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory,\r\nand rename it to be MFCLOC.DLL.  (\"XXX\" stands for the language abbreviation.\r\nFor example, MFC40DEU.DLL contains resources translated to German.)  If you\r\ndon't do this, some of the UI elements of your application will remain in the\r\nlanguage of the operating system.\r\n\r\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
