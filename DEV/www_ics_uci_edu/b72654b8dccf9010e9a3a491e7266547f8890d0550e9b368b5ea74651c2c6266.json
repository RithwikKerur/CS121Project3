YESHAYA DAVID4 SPIRA  (MESHULUM ZISHE BEN ZVI ELIMELECH3, ZVI ELIMELECH OF DINOV ('BNEI \nYISSASCHAR')2, PESACH1 LANGSAM) died Bef. 1906.  He married RIVKA FRIMET.  She died Bef. 1895.\n\nNotes for YESHAYA DAVID SPIRA:\nGrandson of Zvi Elimelech of Dinov, the 'Bnei Yissaschar'.  Yeshaya David Spira and his wife Rivka Frimet \nhad one son and six daughters.  Four of the daughters lived in Sendziszow ('Sendeshov') and two in \nDembica.  The children of their son Yitzchok Yehuda lived in Wielopole (Vielipoli) and Jedlicze (Yedlitch) \nThese towns are all located within 50 km (30 miles) of each other.  The nearest larger towns, Reisha \n(Rzeszow) and Krosno, are about midway between Krakow and Lvov (Lemberg), and are also not far from \nDinov and Blusiv.  Apparently, Yeshaya David's father Meshulum Zishe died young, while his father the \nRebbe was still alive.  Young Yeshaya David was raised in the home of the Rebbe.\n\nNotes for RIVKA FRIMET:\nThe families of Yeshaya David Spira and Rivka Frimet were nearly decimated by the Shoah (Holocaust).  \nFour of their daughters (Chana Mindel, Dreyzil, Nechama Yita and Layah) were apparently murdered by the \nNazis when they were elderly (in their 70's) as were many of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  \nOnly one child of Yeshaya David and Rivka Frimet, Sima Spira and her husband Pinchas Schein, had \nearlier migrated from Europe to the US (abt. 1906).  The circumstances leading to that emigration are not \nknown.  Miraculously, four of the six siblings of Sima who remained in Europe had at least one grandchild \nwho survived the Holocaust.  These European-born great grandchildren of Yeshaya David and Rivka Frimet, \nand their descendents, are alive today and thriving in the US and in Israel, and have contributed significantly \nto the information about their branches of this family tree.\n\t\nChildren of YESHAYA SPIRA and RIVKA are:\n2.\ti.\tCHANA MINDEL5 SPIRA, d.

Lived in Dembica.  Was shot by the Nazis in Dembica \nwhen the Nazis killed the elderly Jews in 1942.\n\n\n\tiv.\tLAYAH SPIRA, d. died in Holocaust; m. MR. ANKER.\n\nNotes for LAYAH SPIRA:\nLived in Sendziszow, had one son and three daughters:  Malcha, Ruchcha, Chana, all of whom perished \nin the Holocaust.  The married name of one of her daughters was Neybenzahl (lived near Krakow).\n\nLayah Spira was most likely related to Chaim Anker of Chicago, who was known to several members of \nSima Spira's family in America.  Dave Schein mentioned that Chaim Anker had no children.  Whether \nChaim Anker was Layah (Anker) Spira's son, or whether he was a relative of Layah Spira's husband, is \nnot known.\n\n\n4.\tv.\tESTHER SPIRA, d. 1936.\n5.\tvi.\tYITZCHOK YEHUDA SPIRA, b.

He was born Abt. 1872, and died October 17, 1938 in Beth Israel Hospital, New \nYork.\n\nNotes for SIMA ('SYME') BAS YESHAYA DAVID SPIRA:\nSima emigrated from Sendziszow, Poland to the New York, probably in 1906.  Probably she was the \nyoungest child in her family.  \n\nAccording to her daughter Leah (Marcus) Schein, Sima had a photo made (by Chaim Anker??) of her entire \nimmediate family around 1920, when Leah was age 8.  Excluded from the photo were daughter \nFannie/Dreyzil and husband Pinchas (who didn't allow himself to be photographed).  The whereabouts of \nsuch a Schein family photo, or copies of it, are not known.\n\nAccording to Leah (Marcus) Schein, Sima kept on touch by mail with her siblings in Europe, in particular \nLeibish (Yitzchok Yehuda), Dreyzil and Chuma (Nechama Yita).  Leah often went to the post office to mail \nletters to them.  Leah her mother Sima told her that Nechama Yita was a very pretty woman who married \nthree times but had no children (confirmed by Tovia Spira).  Because of this, Sima was concerned that if her \ndaughters didn't have children during the first year of marriage, they might be barren like their Aunt \nNechama.\n\nSima is buried in a family plot at Beth David Cemetary, Elmont, LI, NY.  Also buried there are Pinchas \nSchein and children Miriam, Shlomo and Fannie/Dreyzil (location AA2, off of 'Emanuel Avenue').\n\nNotes for PINCHAS BEN YEHUDA SCHEIN:\nFirst in family to emigrate to the US. May have made one or more trip(s) back to Europe.  Sima and \ndaughters Chana Mindel, Miriam and Rosalie came after Pinchas' original emigration, apparently in 1906 \n(1903?).  Later (in 1910) came children Shlomo and Tessy, 'with a family friend who posed as their \ngrandfather', according to both Leah Marcus and Tessy Costello.  Pinchas Schein had to certify that his son \nShlomo (who was ill) would not become a ward of the state.  Pinchas owned a house at 83 Sherrif Street, \nBrooklyn, NY, with a store downstairs.  Profession:  Tailor.  Made 'Alpaca' suits for rabbis.  He once made \na suit for Cantor Yossele Rosenblatt.
