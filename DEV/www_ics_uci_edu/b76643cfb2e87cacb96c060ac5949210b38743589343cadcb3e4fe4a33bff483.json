For instance, this shape, known as the rhombic dodecahedron\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"rhombic.gif\" WIDTH=359 HEIGHT=343 ALT=\"\"></CENTER>\n<P>\ncan be decomposed into four cuboids:\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"rhombs.gif\" WIDTH=425 HEIGHT=407 ALT=\"\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nHowever, it is still open whether a similar decomposition into cuboids exists for the following octahedron:\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"octahedron.gif\" WIDTH=405 HEIGHT=495 ALT=\"\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nMethods from my recent paper,\n\"<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-hexmesh.html\">Linear\ncomplexity hexahedral mesh generation</A>\", and related work by Scott\nMitchell and Bill Thurston, prove that this octahedron can be meshed if\nwe allow the cuboids to have curved sides.  But it is not known whether\nit can be meshed by straight-sided cuboids.\n<P>\nMore generally, we would like to know under what conditions a hexahedral\nmesh exists, and we would like to find algorithms that construct these\nmeshes whenever they exist.  Other research issues here include the\nnumber of cuboids needed to mesh a given shape, and the quality of the\ncuboid shapes.\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
