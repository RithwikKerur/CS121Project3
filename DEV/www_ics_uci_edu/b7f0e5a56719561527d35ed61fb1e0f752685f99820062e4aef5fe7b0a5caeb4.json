Are domain names forever?\n<p><b>Mark Kosters:</b> If you don't pay, you don't keep.&nbsp; If I have\na name like ibm.com does that name get released?&nbsp; It gets put back\nin free pool.&nbsp; Is the free pool browsable?&nbsp; No, but there are\na lot of third party activities in this area.&nbsp; We removed the status\nflag from the database.\n<p><b>Esther Dyson:</b> The timer is two years.&nbsp; What's the technical\nreason why NSI can't change that.&nbsp; A team at NSI made this assertion.\n<p><b>Mark Kosters:</b> I don't know why that the reg team said that.\n<p>{Ed: Missed some discussion about the status of the other firms.}\n<p><b>Carl Hewitt</b>: {ed: missed the beginning of his discussion} Show\nthe graphs with the name.&nbsp; If we make a\n<br>graph of the number of people divided by the name, will there be more\ncosts. The ratio has gone up.&nbsp; Interesting question.\n<p><b>Jim Whitehead:</b> People are fond of saying that the if a nuclear\nwar occurs, the internet will survive, and route around it.&nbsp; So what\nhappens if NSI's offices were to be taken out, by either war, or some other\ncatastrophe?\n<p><b>Someone:</b> Finanical insolvency will become less of a problem.\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> Perhaps a better phrasing of the question is,\nwhat is the failsafe mechanism that takes over during failure?\n<p><b>Mark Kosters:</b> We have an alternate backup site.&nbsp; Couple\nof weeks later, people will figure how to load that.&nbsp; If there were\na disaster, we'll stay within the status quo.&nbsp; With the current zone\nrelease, use that until put back in order.&nbsp; Worried about dns not\ndying.&nbsp; If cache timeout, no longer get answer.&nbsp; Worst case scenerio\n(totally dead).

Lots of stuff driven off\nof NFS. Not fast enough.&nbsp; We need better nfs server.&nbsp; It will\ndo pretty well, and we are very comfortable.&nbsp; This should scale for\na long time. Common mistakes die.&nbsp; Not set with doc, etc.&nbsp; as\nthings go rhorougn(?), things will be more stable for th future. So is\nthe techincal goal is to make everyone a peer?&nbsp; That's only driven\nin the doc negotiations...&nbsp; {Ed: Missed: Level of technical performance,\nThere are conversations, and most of the principals keep in contact over\nthings...}\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n<br>&nbsp;\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
