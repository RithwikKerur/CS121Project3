Traditionally the results in cryptography\ncommunity provide strong security guarantees: typically hiding everything\nbut user's access pattern to the server. However, the server needs to scan\nthe whole database for each query, which yields unacceptably-slow\nperformance for practical databases.  In contrast, research from database\ncommunity, provides encryption schemes with efficient and optimized\nindexing and flexible query support for various data types. But,\nunfortunately, the security of these schemes is far less clear.\n\n<p>\nIn this talk we will give an overview of a new line of research in\ncryptography community that tries to narrow this gap. The results in this\ncategory mostly investigate the best security guaranties for an encryption\nscheme which also enables sub-linear (typically logarithmic) search.\nWe will in particular discuss deterministic and order preserving\nencryption schemes which enable privacy-preserving search for exact-match and\nrange queries respectively with almost the same efficiency of search over\nun-encrypted data.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
