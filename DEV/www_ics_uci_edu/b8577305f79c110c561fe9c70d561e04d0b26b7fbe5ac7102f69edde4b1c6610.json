I have talked about the importance of backwards compatibility and why it should have its own sub-group. I have discussed why I feel new methods are often justified as a means to cleanly segregate functionality and why non-orthogonal headers are justified as a means to save bandwidth. I have discussed Microsoft\u2019s needs in the areas of distributed authoring and versioning and have given my own opinion on how we might solve those needs. Finally I discussed access control, why it is so vital, and why we should create a sub-group for it.\r\n<BR></UL><UL>\r\nI hope my presentation was informative and will help to spark healthy discussion and debate. We have a large job ahead of us but I am confident that we can provide a solution that will meet everyone\u2019s needs and serve as a means to bring distributed authoring and versioning from the realm of program specific solutions out to the wide world.\r\n</UL><UL>\r\nThank you. </UL> </P> \r\n\r\n</Body>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
