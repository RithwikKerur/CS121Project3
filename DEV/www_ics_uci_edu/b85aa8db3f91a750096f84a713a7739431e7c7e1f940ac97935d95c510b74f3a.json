Fidelity of\nrecording can always improve. We need storage infrastructure to fix dangling\nURLs.\n<p>There are method of preservation and organization, but how do you make\nreference to archive and find the prominent name.&nbsp; It's wrong to save\neverything.&nbsp; Examples: CGI generated pages that can generate infinite\npages. People should capture what's going through their proxy.&nbsp; People\nshould copy and archivally store what is used.&nbsp; Things that are used\nare likely to be referenced in the future.\n<p>To the main point. When we talk about Internet scale naming.&nbsp; You'd\nbetter include time in the scale.&nbsp; We need URL's plus time-stamping.\n<p><b>Mark Kosters(?):</b> Times come from a namespace - changes over the\ntime.&nbsp; Reference to something that doesn't exist?&nbsp; Why?\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> Do you believe in Santa Claus?\n<p><b>Steve Holtz:</b> err.. yes?\n<p><b>Larry Masinter:</b> I'm sorry, but Santa Claus does not exist.
