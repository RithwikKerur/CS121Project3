Arising [oh no!\nyou've guessed!] from Martin Gardner's \"Mathematical Games\" column\nin Scientific American. Relevant issues: Apr 1981, Jun 1981, Oct 1981.\nThe idea of the game is attributed to Steven Brams.\n\nGiven: a planar graph G, all faces initially uncoloured;\n       a palette of n colours;\n       two players, MIN and MAX.\n\nThe players take it it turns to colour a previously uncoloured face\nof G, subject only to the constraint that adjacent faces must not \nhave the same colour. If either player cannot move while there are\nstill uncoloured faces, MAX wins. If all faces become coloured, MIN\nwins. Usually, MIN plays first.\n\nQuestion: is there some finite N such that if n &gt;= N, then MIN can\nwin whatever G is? If so, what is the least such N?\n\nThe following example (due to Lloyd Shapley) shows that N &gt;= 6.\nLet G be (the skeleton of) a dodecahedron. MAX's strategy is to\nalways colour the face opposite MIN's last move, and in the same\ncolour. It's easy to see that this forces 6 different colours to\nbe used, so MAX wins if n &lt;= 5.\n\nAfter Gardner's column described this, Robert High discovered a\n20-face map that MAX can win if n &lt;= 6, so that N &gt;= 7. There's\na picture of it in the October 1981 issue: I will post it if there\nis enough interest.\n\nHas anything more been discovered about this game since then?\nGardner retired from writing the column at about that time [1981 \nwas the year he was alternating with Hofstadter].\n\nChris Thompson\nEmail: <a href=\"mailto:cet1@cam.ac.uk\">cet1@cam.ac.uk</a>\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
