The edge Folkman number\nFe(s,t;q) is the order of the smallest Kq-free graph G such that G ->\n(s,t)^e, where G->(s,t)^e is true iff for all red and blue edge\ncolorings of G there exists a monochromatic Ks or Kt. Our main focus\nis on the edge Folkman number Fe(3,3;4). We present relevant\nbackground for this particular problem, survey related work and\ncomputational techniques for computing Folkman numbers, and finally,\ndiscuss ongoing work attempting to prove that the Fe(3,3;4) <= 127. \n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
