In this presentation, \r\nthe focus is directed at understanding the requirements for open software \r\ndevelopment efforts, and how the development of these requirements differs \r\nfrom those traditional to software engineering and requirements engineering. \r\nFour open software development communities are described, examined, and compared \r\nto help discover what these differences may be. Eight kinds of \"software\r\ninformalisms\" are found to play a critical role in the elicitation, analysis,\r\nspecification, validation, and management of requirements for developing\r\nopen software systems. Subsequently, understanding the roles these software\r\ninformalisms take in a new formulation of the requirements development process\r\nfor open source software is the focus of this study. This focus enables considering\r\na reformulation of the requirements engineering process and its associated\r\nartifacts or (in)formalisms to better account for the requirements for developing\r\nopen source software systems.<br>\r\n <br>\r\n </div>\r\n <br>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
