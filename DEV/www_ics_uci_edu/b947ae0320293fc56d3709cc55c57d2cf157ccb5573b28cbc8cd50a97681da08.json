We want to place (minimum number\nof) trackers (or check points) at some specific intersections so that based\non the sequence of trackers a person has encountered, we can identify the\nexact path traversed by the person. Motivated by such applications, we study\nthe Tracking Paths problem in this paper. Given an undirected graph with a\nsource s, a destination t and a non-negative integer k, the goal is to find a\nset of vertices of size at most k, a tracking set, that intersects each s-t\npath in a unique sequence. Such a set enables a central controller to track\nall the paths from s to t. We first show that the problem is NP-complete.\nThen we show that the finding a tracking set of size at most k is\nfixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by the solution size. More\nspecifically, given an undirected graph on n vertices and an integer k, we\ngive a polynomial time algorithm that either determines that the graph can\nnot be tracked by k trackers or produces an equivalent instance of size\nO(k^7).\n\n<p>\nPaper by Aritra Banik, Pratibha Choudhary, Daniel Lokshtanov, Venkatesh\nRaman, and Saket Saurabh.\n<a href=\"https://www.ii.uib.no/~daniello/papers/trackingPathsLATIN18.pdf\">\nhttps://www.ii.uib.no/~daniello/papers/trackingPathsLATIN18.pdf</a>\n\n\n</body></html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
