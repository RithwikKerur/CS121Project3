Goland and I am the program manager for\nInternet Protocols at Internet Explorer. Just so my actions don't seem\ncompletely out of left field I am also in charge of HTTP versioning and\nfile control extensions at Microsoft. Specifically, I am putting\ntogether a doc listing our needs and proposed solutions. I hope to post\nthat doc to this group on Saturday or Sunday. From what I have read I\nsuspect our needs documents will match very closely. This project is\ncurrently my #1 priority so expect to hear a lot from me as I try to\nsuck up all the knowledge this group has generated. =)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYaron\n\n&gt;----------\n&gt;From: \tJim Whitehead[SMTP:ejw@ics.UCI.EDU]\n&gt;Sent: \tThursday, August 22, 1996 3:24 PM\n&gt;To: \t<a href=\"mailto:www-vers-wg@ics.UCI.EDU\">www-vers-wg@ics.UCI.EDU</a>\n&gt;Subject: \tCurrent status\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This message contains my current understanding of the status of this\n&gt;working group.\n&gt;\n&gt;I received an email yesterday from Larry Masinter, Chair of the HTTP\n&gt;Working Group.  He stated that:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The deadline for 1.2 features was \"two weeks after the Montreal\n&gt;&gt;meeting\", and then \"August 1\", but of course, the deadline has no\n&gt;&gt;force, and new proposals can be entertained whenever. However, I'd\n&gt;&gt;like to encourage you to go public sooner rather than wait until you\n&gt;&gt;think you have it \"right\".\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you're not ready to circulate a specification of the actual\n&gt;&gt;protocol changes, are you at least ready to circulate a specification\n&gt;&gt;of the requirements that might lead to protocol changes?\n&gt;\n&gt;I feel it is very important for this group to inform the HTTP 1.2 effort on\n&gt;the requirements for versioning on the WWW.  As a result, there is one\n&gt;current action item:\n&gt;\n&gt;- Submit a document on requirements for the capabilities which should be\n&gt;supported in versioning via HTTP.  Status: David Durand and Fabio Vitali\n&gt;submitted to the list a draft requirements document.  David and I met today\n&gt;to discuss this requirements document, the result of which a slightly\n&gt;revised requirements document will be presented to this list early next\n&gt;week, hopefully end-of-day Monday.  This document will be forwarded to the\n&gt;HTTP WG at the end of next week, August 30.\n&gt;\n&gt;Following the generation of a requirements document, it makes sense to also:\n&gt;\n&gt;- Develop a document listing our proposal for implementing the capabilities\n&gt;listed in the requirements document.  Whether these capabilities are\n&gt;implemented in HTTP 1.2, or become an extension using PEP, it will be a\n&gt;worthwhile exercise to develop this draft proposal.  My current\n&gt;understanding of HTTP methods that might be proposed in this document are:\n&gt;LOCK, UNLOCK, LINK, UNLINK, and possibly a FLAG method.  This document has\n&gt;not yet been started.\n&gt;\n&gt;- Jim Whitehead &lt;<a href=\"mailto:ejw@ics.uci.edu\">ejw@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0110.html\">Yaron Goland: \"MS Versioning Requirements Spec\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0108.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Current status\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
