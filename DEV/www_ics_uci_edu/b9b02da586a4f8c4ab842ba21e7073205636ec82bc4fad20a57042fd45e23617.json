The \npopularity of the web is due in large part to the range of knowledge that \nis accessible.  The depth of knowledge in individual areas has been \nsurprisingly good.  Part of the reason for this is because individual \ncompanies, institutions and agencies contribute to various fields.  \n<p>\nThe field that I am most interested involves the legal field, and more \nspecifically, law schools.  I have used the web over the course of the \nlast several weeks to access information about law schools and more \nimportantly, what they can provide to web users.  <A NAME=\"Q1\">Of most \nimportance, I tried to answer the following questions:</A>\n<ol>\n<li><A HREF=\"#T1\"> What law schools provide information to web users?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#T2\"> Does the presentation or quality of this information \ndiffer from what is available through non-electronic means?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#T3\"> Which schools put out information of higher quality?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#T4\"> Which schools are pioneers in the field in terms of new \nand interesting ways to provide information via electronic means?</A>\n</ol>\n<p>\nWhat I found was a bit surprising.  I entered this project with the \nassumption, however misinformed, that the better the law school, the \nbetter the web page.  And my assumptions also led me to believe that if a \nlaw school was not highly regarded in legal circles, it would in all \nprobability have a web page that was rather non-spectacular.  Well my \nassumptions could not be further from the truth.  The top two law schools in \nthe country, <A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.law.yale.edu/\"> Yale</A> and \n<A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.harvard.edu:71/11/.links/.LAW\"> \nHarvard,</A> do not have web pages but rely on a gopher \nmenu instead.  These menus are poorly developed and are not nearly as \nuseful as \nsome of the services provided by other law schools.  Conversely, one of the \nmost interesting and innovative web pages is from \n<A HREF=\"http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/\"> Case Western Reserve \nUniversity law school,</A> ranked nowhere near the elite U.S. law schools.\n<p>\nMy categorization of U.S. law schools that have web pages can be \nseparated into three distinct groups.  The <A HREF=\"#T2\">first \ngroup</A> is for law schools \nthat are just getting started with the web.  These law schools lack the \ninnovation of others, but are to be commended for experimenting with the \nweb.  The <A HREF=\"#T3\">second group</A> is comprised of law schools that \noffer intesting \nand detailed web pages that are useful for web users and prospective \nstudents.  These pages provide text and sometimes pictures that are \nhelpful in learning about the school.  The <A HREF=\"#T4\">third group</A> is \ncomprised of \nthe elite U.S. law schools in terms of their web pages, but not \nnecessarily their legal reputation.  These schools have gone far beyond \nthe typical web page and have experimented with innovative pages that are \nvery useful to web users.  They are the legal pioneers of the web \ncommunity.  My findings about law school web pages can be summarized by \nanswering my four initial <A HREF=\"#Q1\">questions</A> posed at the \nbeginning of this paper.\n\n<A NAME=\"Questions\"><H2>Questions I Have Asked</H2></a>\n<ol>\n<li><A NAME=\"T1\">What law schools provide information to web users? </A>\n<p>\nUnfortunately, less than half of the U.S. law schools provide pages for \ninterested web users.  Courtesy of the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/home.html\">University of \nSouthern California Law Library</A>, a listing of <A \nHREF=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/librarys/locators.html\"> law \nschools on the web</A> has been made available for those interested.  \nAlthough the University of Southern California listing is the most \ncomprehensive, there are other services which provide much of the same \ninformation.  <A \nHREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Law/Law_Schools/\">Stanford \nUniversity Law School</A> provides another listing of law schools on the \nweb that is virtually identical to USC's listing. <A \nHREF=\"http://www.jmls.edu/law-sch.html\"> John Marshall Law School</A> also \nprovides a detailed representation of law schools available on the web. \nThe John Marshall listing is unique because it differentiates the law \nschools based on whether or not they are a world wide web server or a \ngopher server.  Another listing of law schools on the web is provided by \n<A HREF=\"http://www.rutgers.edu/lawschool.html\"> Rutgers University Law \nSchool</A> which lists the schools as part of its extensive web page.  \nFinally, there is a listing of law schools and law firms on the world \nwide web that is provided by <A \nHREF=\"http://www.law.indiana.edu/law/lawother.html\">Indiana University \nlaw school</A>.  This listing also contains law schools overseas in such \nplaces as Great Britain and Germany.\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"#Q1\">Return to list of questions.</A>\n <p>\n<li><A NAME=\"T2\">Does the presentation or quality of this information \ndiffer from what is available through non-electronic means?</A>\n<p>\nFor some law school web pages, the information available is no more \nparticularly valuable than what is offered in catalog form (in some \ncases, the information is less worthwhile than printed information).  One \nexample of a modest web page is the one offered by <A \nHREF=\"http://www.whittier.edu/www/lawhome.html#top\">Whittier Law \nSchool</A>.  This page offers a brief description of the law school but \nthere is little substantive information about courses, faculty or \nadmissions statistics.  There are no pictures of the law school or \nsurrounding area. <p> Perhaps the most pathetic menu is the one offered \nby one of the elite U.S. law schools:  <A \nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.harvard.edu:71/11/.links/.LAW\">Harvard Law \nSchool.</A>  This web page has no graphics or pictures, not to mention a \ncomprehensive table of contents.  The only thing that is offered is a listing\n of courses.  The\n <A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.harvard.edu:71/00/.LAW/.cdesc/LAWcoursealpha10\">\ncourse information</A> is presented in simple text form and could use \nsome additional work.   The only law school in the country that is \nranked higher than Harvard is <A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.law.yale.edu/\"> \nYale</A>.<p>  Yale's gopher-limited menu is \nrather mundane.  The information is standard and the presentation is \nnon-spectacular.  The gopher menu that was produced by Yale is for the \nentire college rather than the law school itself.  Yale was kind enough \nto include a <A HREF=\"gopher://yaleinfo.yale.edu:105/2\">Yale search \ndirectory</A> so I typed in 'law school' but was not overwhelmed with the \nresults of my <A \nHREF=\"gopher://yaleinfo.yale.edu:105/2?law+school\">search.</A>  The \ndifference between web pages and gopher services really begins to show.\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"#Q1\">Return to list of questions.</A>\n<p>\n<li><A NAME=\"T3\">Which schools put out information of higher quality?</A>\n<p>\nMany law schools are beginning to put out information that is obviously \nof higher quality.  These web pages include pertinent information about \nthe faculty, school, admissions and the surrounding community.  One \nexample of this is the web page put forth by <A \nHREF=\"http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/lawschool.html\">Stanford \nUniversity Law School</A>.  Using this web page, users can access \ninformation about the <A \nHREF=\"http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/study.html\"> study of\nlaw at Stanford</A>, <A \nHREF=\"http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/student.html\">student \norganizations</A>, the <A \nHREF=\"http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/faculty.html\">faculty \nand deans</A> and <A \nHREF=\"http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/aid.html\">financial \naid.</A>  More personal information such as <A \nHREF=\"http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/childcare.html\">child \ncare</A> and <A \nHREF=\"http://www-leland.stanford.edu/group/law/health.html\">\nhealth services</A> is also available.\n<p>Another California law school, \n<A HREF=\"http://www.uchastings.edu/\">Hastings College of the Law</A>, has \ndistinguished itself by including a photograph of the law school on its \nweb page (The <A HREF=\"http://www.law.uc.edu/\">University of Cincinnati \nCollege of Law</A> also provides a photograph of the law school).  Another \nuseful tool on the Hastings web page is the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.uchastings.edu/feedback.html\">feedback form</A> for \ncomments.  For current legal topics, web users can access the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.uchastings.edu/womenslj/womenslj.html\">\nHastings Women's Law Journal</A>.  This service provides \"critical \nperspectives\" on current topics such as the O.J. Simpson trial.  One of \nthe law schools with a comprehensive description of its library is the <A \nHREF=\"http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/library/library.html\">Tarlton Law \nLibrary</A> from the University of Texas at Austin.\n<p>\n<A HREF=\"#Q1\">Return to list of questions.</A>\n<p>\n<li><A NAME=\"T4\">Which schools are pioneers in the field in terms of new \nand interesting ways to provide information via electronic means?</A> \n<p>\nThere are three law schools that I believe to be the legal pioneers on \nthe web.  The first is the \n<A HREF=\"http://felix.law.washington.edu/CondonHome.html\"> University of \nWashington School of Law</A>.  I have selected this law school because of \nits listing of \n<A HREF=\"http://www.law.washington.edu/lawinternet/lawweb.html\"> internet \nlaw resources</A>.  This service provides links for web users to\n<A HREF=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/supct.table.html\">\nSupreme Court decisions</A>, <A HREF=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/govdocs.html\">\nU.S. Government Hypertexts</A> and the \n<A HREF=\"gopher://aclu.org:6601/\"> American Civil Liberties Union</A>.  \nAll of these services are useful and they help to enhance the quality of \nthe <A HREF=\"http://felix.law.washington.edu/CondonHome.html\">\nUniversity of Washington</A> home page.\n<p>The second law school home page that is noticeably better than most \nothers is the one provided by the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/home.html\">\nUniversity of Southern California Law Center and Law Library.</A>  This \nweb page provides access to \n<A HREF=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/legallst/topiclst.html\">\nfederal legal resources</A> as well as\n<A HREF=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/legallst/ca.html\">\nCalifornia legal resources.</A>  USC did not stop there however.  There \nare also \n<A HREF=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/legallst/intlaw.html\"> International\nLegal Materials</A> and \n<A HREF=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/law-lib/legallst/un.html\">\nUnited Nations Resources</A> available.  These research tools are very \nuseful for people interested in legal issues.  Unfortunately, the legal \nresources offered by U.S.C. do not include a comprehensive listing of \njudicial decisions.  This can only be obtained by services such as Westlaw\nand Lexus that charge for log-on time.  \n<p>\nThe last pioneer law school on the web is \n<A HREF=\"http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/\"> Case Western Reserve Law \nSchool</A>.  Case Western is a pioneer for a couple of reasons.  First of \nall, it provides a comprehensive list of \n<A HREF=\"http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/1/internetlibraries\"> \nInternet Law Related Libraries.</A>  This may not instantly provide \ninformation to users, but it provides hypertext links to libraries that \ncan.  Another innovation from Case Western is the ability to request <A \nHREF=\"http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/0h/cwrulaw/form/application.html\">\napplication materials</A> from the law school on-line.  Perhaps the next \nstep will be to actually apply to law schools by using the web.  Finally, \nfor those interested in international law, Case Western provides a \n<A HREF=\"http://holmes.law.cwru.edu/0/intlaw/start.html\"> Digest of the \nInternational Law of the United States.</A>  All three of these services \nare interesting and useful to the law student or prospective student.\n\n\n\n</ol>\n<HR>\nCurrently, there are only a few law schools that provide extensive access to \nlegal knowledge via the world wide web. However, these schools are successful in \nproviding a wide range of knowledge and have already established a foundation \nfor other law schools to follow.  Eventually, law schools should be able to \nprovide a wide range of services for web users.  For instance, prospective \nstudents could apply to law schools on-line.  Comprehensive judicial decisions \ncould be made available for web users free of charge.  Each law school could also \ninclude law review articles as part of their web page in order to assist web \nusers with research.  All of these services will help to expand the usefulness \nof these law school web pages and at the same time increase the importance of \nthe world wide web.  Eventually, as the services of the world wide web expand, \nthe need for non-electronic information will become greatly diminished.  \nAlready, we are seeing the tremendous demand for information via the world wide web.\n\n<p><it><A HREF=\"#Q1\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted by Mark Malovos on March 16, 1995 for <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\"> ICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
