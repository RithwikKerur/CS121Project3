While the\ndeterministic case of this problem has been studied extensively,\nlittle work has been done on the randomized case. For <i>\nm</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 a randomized 4/3-competitive algorithm was\nfound by Bartal, Fiat, Karloff and Vohra. I have recently developed\ntwo algorithms for <i>m</i>&nbsp;<u>&gt;</u>&nbsp;3. The first is\n1.55871-competitive for <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3. The second achieves\ncompetitive ratios of 1.67517, 1.74114, 1.78810 and 1.82082, for\n<i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4,5,6,7 respectively. These competitive ratios\nare less than the best deterministic lower bound for <i>\nm</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,4,5 and less than the best known deterministic\ncompetitive ratio for <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,4,5,6,7. In this talk,\nI explain the first algorithm, and outline a proof of its\ncompetitiveness. \n\n<p>I shall also talk about two models of multiprocessor scheduling\nwith rejection. The first is the model of Bartal, Leonardi,\nMarchetti-Spaccamela, Sgall and Stougie. I have developed two\nrandomized algorithms for this model. The first algorithm performs\nwell for small <i>m</i>, achieving competitive ratios of 3/2,\n1.83579, 2.05441 for <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,3,4, respectively. The\nsecond algorithm outperforms the first for <i>m</i>&nbsp;<u>\n&gt;</u>&nbsp;5. It beats the deterministic algorithm of Bartal <i>\net al.</i> for all <i>m</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;5,&nbsp;...&nbsp;1000. I am\ncurrently developing a proof that this is true for all <i>m</i>.\nThe second model differs in that preemption is allowed. For this\nmodel, I have developed a deterministic algorithm which is\n2.38743-competitive for all <i>m</i>. I have also developed\nrandomized algorithms which outperform the best deterministic\nalgorithms for small <i>m</i>. In this talk, I shall explain my\nnon-preemptive algorithm for small <i>m</i>, and outline its\nanalysis.</p>\n\n<p>(Practice job interview talk.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
