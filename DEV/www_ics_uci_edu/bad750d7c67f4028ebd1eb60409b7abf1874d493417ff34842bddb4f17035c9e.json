He has asked your opinion about the system\rfor running elections in Orange County.  He wants a system that is accurate,\rreliable, secure, convenient, and accessible to all voters.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You will write a report of about four pages,\rgiving your recommendations for how to organize voting in Orange County\rin a way that best satisfies these constraints.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You can see from the registrar&#39;s web site,\r</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"http://www.oc.ca.gov/election/\">http://www.oc.ca.gov/election/</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>,\rthat Orange County currently uses eSLATE voting machines; the registrar&#39;s\rsite has a <A HREF=\"http://www.oc.ca.gov/election/eslate/background.htm\">background page</A>\rand a <A HREF=\"http://www.oc.ca.gov/election/eslate/how_to_vote.htm\">multimedia page</A>\rdescribing these machines.  Once you decide how best to handle voting in\rOrange County, you can relate your recommendations to the current system.\r Criticizing or commending the current system should not be your main focus,\rhowever; what the registrar wants is your overall recommendation of how\rto handle elections in Orange County.</FONT></P>\r<BR>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Voting systems:</B>  A voting system (in\rthe broadest sense, including not just technology but the people involved\rand the rules and procedures they follow) should have these qualities, among\rothers:</FONT></P>\r<UL>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Voters find the system understandable and\reasy to use without error, including inexperienced voters, disabled voters,\rolder voters, voters with fixed work hours, poor voters, voters who can&#39;t\rcome to a polling place on election day, and voters whose native language\risn&#39;t English.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Results are accurate (they correctly reflect\rthe expressed intent of the voter), invariant (repeated counts or queries\rproduce the same results), and available quickly.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Voting is secure (only eligible people vote,\reach person votes only once) and private (nobody else should be able to\rfind out how a particular voter voted).</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>More broadly, the system is fair and treats\rpeople equally; it does not give one group of voters any advantage over\ranother.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The public has confidence in the accuracy,\rsecurity, fairness, and legitimacy of the system.  It&#39;s not enough that\rthe system <I>be</I> all those things; the public has to <I>believe</I>\rthat it has all those qualities.  They should not have to accept that it\rworks on blind faith; they should be able to see for themselves that it\rworks, or at least hear it from people <I>they</I> choose to trust.</FONT></LI>\r</UL>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Your task is to design and describe a voting\rsystem that has these characteristics. Your design may not be able to satisfy\revery criterion perfectly--if there were a perfect solution, it would already\rbe implemented and the 2000 election&#39;s problems in Florida wouldn&#39;t\rhave happened (nor would the more recent problems in Florida and elsewhere).\r Be as thorough as you can in four pages, but don&#39;t panic if you hear\rthat one of your classmates discussed something that you didn&#39;t have\rroom for.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You should assume that your reader, Mr. Rodermund,\ris very familiar with the voting technologies available; you should not\rspend any time describing punched cards, optical scanners, touch screens,\rinternet voting, cryptography, or any other technologies.  Your analysis\rshould focus on how the technology (or combination of technologies) you\rrecommend will meet the criteria listed above and satisfy the major constituencies\r(stakeholders):  voters, candidates, political parties, office holders,\relection officials, and the general public.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>There are no &quot;right answers&quot; to\rthis assignment.  The most important thing is that you describe how each\rof your recommendations will improve the voting process, and how each aspect\rof your design will affect the various constituencies involved.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Stage I:  Decide on your recommendations\r(due Wednesday, April 14)</B></FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>First, decide what systems and procedures\rshould be implemented (or maintained, if they already exist).  Read the\rassigned articles, discuss ideas in section and with your classmates (perhaps\ron the NoteBoard at eee.uci.edu), try to think of how each of the criteria\rand each of the constituencies will be affected by what you recommend. \rWe don&#39;t expect you to do significant outside research, but of course\ryou may use any information you like, so long as you cite it properly. \rThis is the part of the assignment that requires the greatest intellectual\reffort and the most time--don&#39;t neglect it just because the written\rproduct of this stage (see below) is relatively informal.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Once you know what you plan to propose (including\rthe reasons behind your choices and what effect you expect each recommendation\rto have), write them down in outline form and turn the outline in electronically\rvia Checkmate.  You must also bring a paper copy of your outline to a face-to-face\rmeeting you will schedule with Keri Carpenter on Wednesday or Thursday,\rApril 14 or 15.  She will look over your outline to make sure you&#39;re\ron the right track.  (The outline and the meeting are required; your score\rwill be lowered if you don&#39;t submit electronically and show up to your\rmeeting.)</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Be sure to keep the paper copy of your approved\routline; you will need to turn it in with the draft and final versions.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Stage II:  Write your memo (due Thursday,\rApril 29)</B></FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Second, write your memo, following your outline\rand the TA&#39;s suggestions.  Your memo should be about four pages long\r(in 10 or 12 point type, double spaced)--not less than three and not more\rthan five. </FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Content, organization, and clarity are more\rimportant than precisely what format you follow.  However, your memo or\rreport must have a one-paragraph executive summary (a paragraph that starts\rout with the words &quot;Executive summary:&quot;) that lists your major\rrecommendations. The executive summary appears at the top, but you don&#39;t\rwrite it until after you write the body of the memo.  Mr. Rodermund is busy,\rand while you expect him to read your whole memo, the executive summary\rmay help him decide whether to read it now or later.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>This version will be graded; the TA will make\rcomments and suggest improvements.  Your grade for this part will count\r30% of your grade on the whole assignment, so it pays to do as well as you\rcan at this point.  Turn this in on April 29 (on paper at the beginning\rof class; electronically using Checkmate). </FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Be sure to keep the paper copy of your graded\rdraft memo; you will turn it in again with the final version.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Stage III:  Revise your memo (due Tuesday,\rMay 11)</B></FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Third, after your graded memo is returned,\rrevise your memo, taking into account the comments of the TA.  This final\rmemo will count 70% of the grade on the whole assignment.  Turn this in\ron Thursday, May 11 (on paper in class and electronically).</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>What to turn in:</B>  When you turn in\ryour Stage II memo on paper, include a copy of the outline you went over\rwith the TA.  When you turn in the paper version of your Stage III revised\rmemo, include that same Stage I outline and your graded Stage II memo. \rIncluding your previous work is important context for the grading; to receive\rcredit, you need to turn in your previous work in the package.  Don&#39;t\rforget the other guidelines on the sheet of &quot;<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/139w/requirements.html\">Writing Assignment Requirements</A>&quot;.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Other important advice:</B>  Based on students&#39;\rwork in the past, we&#39;d like to suggest some things for you to consider\ras you work:</FONT></P>\r<UL>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Get your facts straight.  While we don&#39;t\rexpect you to be perfect experts on voting technologies, you shouldn&#39;t\rmake claims that aren&#39;t true (for example, don&#39;t say that optical\rscanners produce reliable, unambiguous results) and you should think through\ryour recommendations and make sure they make sense (for example, don&#39;t\rassume that all voters have easy access to an internet-connected computer).</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Know your audience.  Use an appropriate tone--relatively\rformal--when writing for a government official.  Avoid slang and humor.\r Don&#39;t tell the reader things she already knows (you can check with\rus if you don&#39;t know what might need explaining).</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Keep organized.  You should state each recommendation\rclearly; the recommendations should proceed logically from one to the next,\rdescribing the expected benefits and drawbacks of each in turn.</FONT></LI>\r<BR><BR>\r<LI>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Watch your wording.  Use a dictionary to make\rsure that the words you use mean what you want them to mean.  Use a writing\rguide (like <I>Writing from A to Z</I>) to make sure your sentences comply\rwith the standard.</FONT></LI>\r</UL>\r<BR>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>We can expect to see more real-world proposals\rfor voting reform in the next few months.  Having spent this time thinking\rabout the issues, you&#39;ll be uniquely placed to comment on them.</FONT></P>\r<P>\r<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Background on American elections:  </B>If\rpast classes are any guide, there may be some students who don't actually\rhave much experience with the American election system.  To help you get\rgoing on the assignment, here are some good sources of information.
