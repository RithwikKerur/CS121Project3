The system can be built using knowledge\n acquisition from expert in the domain or by learning from data or both. Some domains used in the past are:\n Admission to a Phd program, Loan expert advisor, Basketball simulator, Handicappers (picking winners in horseracing).\n<p align=\"justify\">\nThe domain you select should be sufficiently complex. It should have enough variables (at least 50 variables).\n You would need to validate the model somehow. This can be done by connecting with an expert in the domain or\n by having data. Once you have the Bayesian network, you should propose what kinds of experimental evaluation \n to conduct over it.  The projects below are not well defined. They are ideas. Part of your project task is to\n define the scope and provide the details of your project.\n<p align=\"justify\">\nIn constraint networks projects, you will also need to model your domain using a collection of constraints  and\n perhaps using some objective functions, using one of the tools for constraints and then show how you solve the\n problem and how you evaluate the quality of your model and solutions.\n<p align=\"justify\">\n<Hr noshade>\n<div class=\"section\">1.    Email management project.</div>\nThe problem: people receive thousands of emails which require some action\n(answer, discard and file). \n<p> \nEmail management becomes unmanageable.\n<p>\nThe project: build a system that help decide:\n<ol>\n  <li>\n   what email to answer next (prioritize emails)\n <li> What emails to discard and what to file to other folders. \n</ol>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nThe input is a collection of emails that were received. Each message should have a collection of features\n (time of arrival, sender, title, length, number of recipients, topic and response time).\n<p align=\"justify\">\nMethodology: learning: look at past messages received and the decisions made.\n<br>\n<a name=topics>See</a> Padhraic Smyth's <a href = \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~smyth/topics.html\">topic modelling page</a>.

TA assignments.</div>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n Given class schedules for quarter, the number of TA needed for each class, TA's preferences and qualification,\n and instructors' choice of preferred TA, schedule the TA's in a way that maximize some measure of satisfaction.\n (Real data may be available, talk to Mark Cartnal). See the page for the <a href=\"http://www.cs.qub.ac.uk/~B.McCollum/patat10/\"> PATAT</a> - International conference on the practice and theory automated timetabling.  \n<br>\n<div class=\"section\"><a name=class_scheduling> 3. Class scheduling.</a></div>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n The problem is to find a schedule for classes, classrooms, and teachers for a teaching setting\n (e.g., a high school, a computer science department). Measure of satisfaction can be to\n minimize the number of weighted constraints violated. Students can use the REES tool to model and\n run their algorithms.

Advising a first year student.</div>\n<p align=\"justify\">\nA freshman student needs to make many decisions in his first year (what is his major, what classes to take, etc.)\n Build a Bayesian network or a constraint network (or a mixture of both),\n based on your own expertise that will advise a first year student in his first steps on campus.\n See <a href= \"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter/courses/ics-175a/winter-2010/IJAMT_Paper.pdf\">paper</a> by Avi Dechter.\n <br>\n<div class=\"section\">5.
