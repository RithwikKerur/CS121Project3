A newsgroup is a bulletin board that allows users to conduct discussions centered around a particular topic, somewhat like today's Web logs (commonly called \"blogs\").  Despite their declining popularity, tens of thousands of newsgroups still exist on the Internet, covering a wide variety of topics.</p>\n\n<p>Since newsgroups predate the existence of the Web, they operate on a completely different protocol.  As a result, you can't read newsgroups with a Web browser.  Instead, you need software called a <i>news reader</i>.  Fortunately, one of the most common email software packages for Windows, Microsoft Outlook Express, contains a news reader.  The full Netscape/Mozilla package does, too, as part of its email software (which is called Communicator); similarly, Mozilla's Thunderbird package also provides this support.</p>\n\n<p>If you prefer, you can download dedicated news reader software, such as <a href=\"http://www.forteinc.com/\">Forte Free Agent</a>.  Dedicated news readers tend to have a great deal more functionality (such as extracting binary files from sets of combined newsgroup messages), at the cost of a substantial increase in complexity.  If you're new to this stuff, I suggest using Outlook Express or one of the Mozilla products.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Connecting to a news server</p>\n\n<p>In order to set up any news reader software, you need at least the following pieces of information:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><b>News server</b> or <b>NNTP server</b>: news.service.uci.edu</li>\n  <li><b>Username/password</b>: your UCInetID and password</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In order to read a newsgroup, you need to connect to a <i>news server</i> (also known as an <i>NNTP server</i>).  News servers keep copies of messages from a wide variety of groups and allow you to download them.  Some groups, like <b>alt.music.counting-crows</b>, are distributed worldwide.  Our course newsgroup, <b>ics.184</b>, is distributed only on the UCI news server, since it concerns only UCI students.</p>\n\n<p>Most news servers require a login and password.  UCI's news service requires you to log in with your UCInetID and password.</p>\n\n<p>With this information, you should be able to configure any news reader software properly, though it can be a bit tricky if you're not familiar with the software.  So, in the following section, I'll explain how to set up Outlook Express as your news reader.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">Setting up Outlook Express as your news reader</p>\n\n<p>Follow this set of steps and you should be able to read and write messages on our newsgroup:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Connect yourself to the Internet.  You need to be connected when you first set up your news reader software.</li>\n  <li>Start up Outlook Express.  Go to the Tools menu and select \"Accounts...\"</li>\n  <li>On the ensuing dialog, click the \"Add\" button and select \"News...\" on the resulting menu.</li>\n  <li>Next, you'll be taken through the \"Internet Connection Wizard\".  Enter your name and email, as requested, clicking the \"Next\" button after each.</li>\n  <li>Now enter <b>news.service.uci.edu</b> into the field marked \"News (NNTP) server\".  Be sure to check the box marked \"My news server requires me to log on\", then click the \"Next\" button.</li>\n  <li>Into the field marked \"Account name\", type your UCInetID.</li>\n  <li>Into the field marked \"Password\", type your UCInetID's password.  Go ahead and check the \"Remember password\" box, so you won't have to re-type your password every time.  Don't check the box marked \"Log on using Secure Password Authentication (SPA)\".</li>\n  <li>Click the \"Next\" button, then click \"Finish\" and you're ready to connect.</li>\n  <li>Next, you'll be asked if you want to download a list of newsgroups.  Click the \"Yes\" button.  (If you're on a dial-up connection, this may take a little time, but it only has to be done once.)</li>\n  <li>Now you should see a list of newsgroups.  Select <b>ics.184</b> from the list and click the \"Subscribe\" button.</li>\n  <li>Finally, press the \"Go To\" button, and you should see a list of all of the messages on our newsgroup!</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">What should I do if I don't want to use Outlook Express?</p>\n\n<p>Get yourself some other news reader software and read its documentation.  I don't have any other news reader software installed, so you'll be on your own to figure out how to set it up.  Just remember, the things you need to know are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><b>News server</b> or <b>NNTP server</b>: news.service.uci.edu</li>\n  <li>Login and password are required.</li>\n  <li>Your login is your UCInetID, your password is your UCInetID password.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"history\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<ul class=\"nomarker\">\n  <li>A few minor changes made by Alex Thornton, Fall 2005.</li>\n  <li>Originally written by Alex Thornton, Winter 2003.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
