If\nthis simplex tiles spaces, then I believe that you get an example of\nthe kind you want.  There is such a triangle with angles of 2*pi/n for\nevery n<U>&gt;</U>7 in the plane, and there is a regular simplex in four\nhyperbolic dimensions with angles of 2*pi/5.  The ideal simplex in\nthree dimensions has angles of pi/3, which gives you a horoball packing\nwhich is also optimal in the sense of Borocky; I don't know if\nhoroballs are okay for you.\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
