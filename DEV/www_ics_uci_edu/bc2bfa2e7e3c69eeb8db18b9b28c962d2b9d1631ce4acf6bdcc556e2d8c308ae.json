However, market participants who desire to hold derivative\nassets such as options or futures would also benefit from trustless\nexchange. In this paper I propose the atomic swaption, which extends the\natomic swap to allow for such exchanges. Crucially, atomic swaptions do\nnot require the use of oracles. I also introduce the margin contract,\nwhich provides the ability to create leveraged and short\npositions. Lastly, I discuss how atomic swaptions may be routed on the\nLightning Network.</p>\n\n<p>(See also <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08644\">arXiv:1807.08644</a>.)</p>\n\n</body></html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
