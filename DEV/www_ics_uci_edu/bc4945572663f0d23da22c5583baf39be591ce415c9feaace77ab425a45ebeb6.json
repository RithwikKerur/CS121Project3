Once you get \nthere and hold onto the mouse button you will see a menu screen that \ngives you choices such as<a \nhref=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Starting \nPoints/NetworkStartingPoints.html\"> World Wide Web.</a> If you highlight WWW \nand move \nthe cursor to the right it will give you Mosaic choices. Select one and \nyour into Mosaic. Once your into Mosaic your choices are unlimted. A good \nselection off of the list to find out what's going on with Mosaic is to \nlook into the<a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/\"> NCSA \nWhat's New</a>.

A hotlist is a place to store information and subject \ntitles that I found interesting on the Web. The things that I found \ninteresting to me I put on my hotlist to save them just in case I wanted \nto refer to them I could just go to my hotlist and retrieve them. Some \nthings that I found interesting on the Web that I put on my hotlist was \nNBA Scores and Highlights, and Car Autos especially<a \nhref=\"http://cbsgil.bu.edu/bmw/bmw.html\"> BMW's</a> and \n<a href=\"http://swiss.ans.net/quattro/\">Audi's.</a> <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>Give a three sentence background history on Aboriginal Studies?</B></A><br>\nMy answer is...The<a href=\"http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-Aboriginal.html\"> \nAboriginal people</a> live a pretty simple life. \nThey live off of the bare necessities of life and they act in ways that \n<a href=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/v-lib/anthropology.html\">Anthropologist</a> \nfeel that we can trace are history from them. \nAnthropologist think that mankind was derived from the Aboriginies. \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>Who are the anthropologists in Australia dealing with and why are they so important?</B></A><br>\nMy answer is...Anthropologists are dealing with people in Australia \ncalled the<a href=\"http://www.vicnet.net.au/vicnet/COUNTRY/ABORI.html\"> \nAboriginal people</a>. The reason why anthropolgist feel \nthat they are so important is because they feel that they are a link to \nmankinds history. This arguement will continue to go on for years. There \nis so much information to be learned and examined by studying these \npeople. Some anthropologists say we are descendants from the<a \nhref=\"http://www.vicnet.net.au/vicnet/pictoria/18v15072.jpg.html\"> \naboriginies</a> \nbecause of the way we look and act.
