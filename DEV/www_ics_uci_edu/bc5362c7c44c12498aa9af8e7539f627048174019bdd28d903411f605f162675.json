Beck, \"Extreme Programming Explained\"</i>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>\r\nAlthough it may seem that the \"stronger\" programmer will do all the work,\r\n  studies show that both programmers can participate and benefit: the weaker\r\n  one sees how the stronger one thinks and works; and the stronger one, by\r\n  explaining things to the weaker one, has a sounding board for his/her\r\n  decisions and ends up with a better understanding of the program.\r\nAlso, bugs that are confusing to one programmer are often transparent to\r\n  another.\r\nFinally, sometimes one programmer will see a simplification that the other\r\n  doesn't see.\r\nUltimately, the code they produced together is better, because it has been\r\n  reviewed by two sets of eyes.\r\n<p>\r\nThe concept of \"pair[not peer!]  pressure\" has also shown itself to be useful.\r\nThe term means that each member of the pair is pressured to perform well; at\r\n  the mundane level, this term can mean that when a time is made to work\r\n  together, both students show up, on time, and work (if you are working by\r\n  yourself, it is much easier to come up with an excuse to delay starting\r\n  work).\r\n<p>\r\nIn the context of learning programming, pair programming allows two students\r\n  to collaborate closely (more closely than if they each were working\r\n  independently).\r\nFor a long programming session, the students should switch off who is the\r\n  driver and who is the navigator every hour or so.\r\nBecause most programming assignments involve multiple programs, another way to\r\n  approach pair programming is to let each student be a driver for one whole\r\n  program before changing.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>Caution</b>:\r\nThere are many ways to subvert the learning experience that pair\r\n  programming can provide.\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>I'll do the even numbered programming assignments; you do the odd\r\n       numbered ones.\r\n  <li>In a multi-program assignment, you write half the programs by yourself,\r\n      I'll write half by myself, and we'll hand in both as joint work.\r\n  <li>I'm the \"stronger\" programmer so I'll always drive and let you only\r\n       navigate.\r\n</ul>\r\nSometimes the subversion is unintentional: the stronger student just takes\r\n  control and doesn't let the weaker student do anything.\r\nBut since much of the course grade is based on how students perform on \r\n  in-class programming exams, which they must complete by themselves, students\r\n  taking shortcuts on programs during the semester will be ill prepared for\r\n  these exams.\r\nIf your partner is not participating, or is not letting you participate,\r\n  please contact me so that we can resolve the problem before irreparable harm\r\n  is done to both partners.\r\n<p>\r\nThe following\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.realsearchgroup.org/pairlearning/educators.php\">\r\n  Pair Programming Video Site</a>\r\n  introduces pair programming to students and discusses a similar list of\r\n  \"do's and don'ts.\"\r\nOn the first entry on this page, click either <b>mov</b> or <b>wmv</b> to see\r\n   a 9 minute movie (it might take a few minutes to load); also print a copy\r\n   of the <b>accompanying worksheet</b>.\r\nHere is an alternative shorter video, a bit rougher but more realistic\r\n  <a href=\"http://www.comscigate.com/video/pairPrg/ppDemo.mpg\">\r\n  Pair Programming: Goals and a Demo</a>. \r\n<p>\r\nDuring the quarter, on some assignments pair programming will be prohibited,\r\n  on some -especially the early ones- it will required, on most it will be\r\n  allowed/optional.\r\nEach assignment will indicate what rules are in effect in relation to pair\r\n  programming.\r\n<p>\r\nFinal words: this is a great learning technique but it requires some maturity\r\n  to use it correctly: put in the effort and the rewards will be great.\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"100%\">\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
