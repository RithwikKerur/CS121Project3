WWW is a universe of ideas and information \naccessed via network and is a research tool of immense magnitude.  Though \nthe Web is not dependant on the Internet to function, it is dependant on \nit to access the volumes of information that is out there.  The Web was \nconceived as a means to share information without regards to the various \ndifferent protocols and emulations that computers use.  <A \nHREF=\"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html\"> HTML</a> is \nthe backbone of the Web.  Hypertext markup language allows one to jump \n(almost) instantaneously from one document to another.  A <i>web \nbrowser</i> is necessarry to use html.<A \nHREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-about.html\"> \nNSCA Mosaic</a> is the web browser of choice at the moment.  However, \nthere are many other browsers out there such as Lynx, NetScape, Cello and \nmany others.  They all offer basic web access while some offer multimedia \ncapabilities.   \n\n <p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n<p>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>HTML? What possible use can it be to me?</H2></A>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.iuma.com/~scam/\"><IMG ALT=\"[SCAM]\" WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=59\nSRC=\"http://www.iuma.com/~scam/Pix/Scam.gif\"--></a> <p>\nSpending hours upon hours online cruising the web can be a very social \nthing.  In fact there is a whole culture known as <a \nHREF=\"http://www.circus.com/~omni/geek.html\"><i>geeks</i> </a> that does \njust \nthat.  My favorite bunch is the Santa Cruz geeks.  For a peek at what \nthey're up to, check out the <A HREF=\"http://www.iuma.com/~scam/\">SCAM</a> \nor Santa Cruz Alternative Music page.  This page also offers links to \ngeek happenings.  Html is their voice to the world.  Many geeks have \ntheir own pages and commune in <A \nHREF=\"http://klinzhai.echo.com/~falcon/geeks/geekhouse.html\"> <i>geek \nhouses</i> </a>which often house web servers of their own.\n<p>\nBut html isn't just about being social.  As a research tool, the Web is \nabsolutely amazing.  You can visit the <a HREF=\" \nhttp://acacia.ens.fr:8080/index.html.en\"> Icole Normale Supirieure</a>, a \nstudent server in France, any major university (and even some smaller \nones) in the world, a restaurant guide for your favorite city and even \nshop electronically.  And, of course, with a decent knowledge of html you \ncan post web pages of your own.  \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n<p>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><H2>To be or not to be...at the Rennaissance \nFaire?</H2></A> \n<p>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.resort.com/~banshee/Faire/index.html\"><IMG \nSRC=\"http://www.resort.com/~banshee/Faire/images/bells.gif\"--> </a>\n<p>\nSo <A HREF=\"http://www.resort.com/~banshee/Faire/index.html\"> <i>what is \nthis Faire thing anyway?</i> </a>  Throughout the year there are \nrecreations of the medieval and rennaissance time periods of Europe held \nall over the country.  In California the major events are the Rennaissance \nPleasure Faires, northern and <A HREF=\"http://www.resort.com/~banshee/ExploreSouthern/Explore-Southern.html\">southern </a> , run by the Living History Center.\n  These particular faires feature authentic culture of the Elizabethan \n(Shakespearean) period: food, entertainment, \nand even a battle or two.  Keep in mind that it is always more enjoyable \nto go to faire in <A \nHREF=\"http://www.resort.com/~banshee/Faire/Costume/costume.html\"> \n<i>period costume</i> </a>.  The actors \ntreat you much better and you'll get a better feel for rennaissance life \nif you can join in.  The <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu:80/~rodmur/sca/\"> \nSCA </a> (Society for Creative Anachronism) is dedicated to recreating \nand chronicalling the time period and also offers wonderful insight to \nmedieval and rennaissance life. \n<p>\n\n<A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n<p><LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>How would one say, \"You have dishonored my\n   hamster?\" in Klingon?</H2></A>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.kli.org/\"><IMG \nSRC=\"http://www.kli.org/KLItrefoil.gif\" alt=\"\" width=135 height=120--> </a>\n<p>\n\"nay'qoqvammo' DaHoHta\" means (if I have interpreted my research properly) \n\"You have dishonored my tribble.\"  In the Klingon language \"tribble\" is \nthe closest approximation to hamster.
