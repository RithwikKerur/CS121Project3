If you are \nplanning to travel or just inquire about a country the Virtual Tourist \n(by Brandon Plewe) is the place to \nvisit.   It serves as a visual interface into the geographic distribution \nof the WWW servers.  It gathers \ntourism, geographical and cultural information about a specific region.  \nAll you have to do is click on a \nsymbol or boxed region within the Mosaic page.  <A \nhref=\"http://wings.buffalo.edu/world\"><b>click here to \nview!</b></A> the available page.</P>\n\n<li><P>\nTraveling trough the world may be to exhausting for some.  Maybe a more \nspecific search is needed.  The \nWeb is the place to do it.  The Yellow pages may sometimes lack the \nspecific information we need about a \nparticualr business.  The list of Comercial Services on the Web and (Net) \nis available with lots of more  \ndetail.  On this page dozzens of links to businesses, business service \nand nonprofit organizations are \navailabel.  Take a look to see what you can find.  <A \nhref=\"http://www.directory.net\"><b>click here!</b></A></p>\n<p>Here you can browse through the businesses you are \ninterested in, get detail information and even order.  For example, when \nclick on the above, the page asks \nyou to enter a search, you could enter the word flower and a list of \nflorist will appear you may choose \none or several and even  order what you like.</P>\n <li><P>Businesses still have lot's of improvements comming up.  There is \na lot to look forward in the future.  \nFor example in the future we may be able to do our banking in our home \ncomputer.  Bank of America has a \nhome page that promises lot's of potential.  All your transactions can be \ntaken care of by clicking a few \nicons.  Imagine no more waiting in line or dealing with tellers who are \nslow and don't know much. View <A \nhref=\"http://www.bankamerica.com\".<b>Bank of America!</b></A>\n<P>\nWe may be able to have it all.  Now we can travel form our computers and \nlearn about the different \ncountries and specific reagions without spending money.  In the future we \nmay be able to do it all.  From \nour  banking need to shopping for groceries.  Computers will become as \nnecessary as a car.\n </ol>\n\n<A NAME=\"Questions\"><H2>Questions I can now answer</H2></a>\n<ol>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ1\">What is the importance of the World Wide Web?                                                                                                                                              </A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ2\">What kind of information about Spain is available in \nthe Web?</A> <li><A HREF=\"#QQ3\">How can you find interesting information in \nthe field of social \nsciences? </A> <li><A HREF=\"#QQ4\">How can one create a page to view in Mosaic?</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ5\">Where can you find sources in Spanish to practice reading as well as learn about other places where the official language is spanish?</A>\n</ol>\n\n<HR>\n<OL>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ1\"><B>What is the importance of the World Wide Web?</B></A>\n<P>Before this class I had no idea the web existed.  Now I realize how much \ntime I could have saved if I had known about it before.  You can do \nresearch and get lots of updated information in less time than doing \nlibrary research.  But is not just beneficial for students, the web is \nfun for any user since you can explore items world wide.  Most of the \nbrowsers are easy to use.  A popular one is Mosaic, since it includes \ngraphics is fun to work with.  If one is interested in animal then you could \naccess this <A \nhref=\"http://www.umanitoba.ca/arrs/index.html\"><b> \narticle </b> </A>.  This particular example is found in the Animal Rights Resource Site \nbut it \ncould also be from your next door neighbor since any one can create a document in \nthe Web.  The most amazing aspects of the Web is the ability to conect to \ncomputers around the world.  I recently connected to \n<A href=\"http://www.sunet.se:80/stockholm/\"><b>Stockholm, Sweden</b></A> and looked at the \ninformation they have on museums and the water festival.  The most amazing graphics are \navailable to view.</P>\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>What kind of information about Spain is available in the Web?</B></A>\n<P>Through the Web we could get a grasp about the culture in Spain.  It tells us what \nSpain offers us as tourists and as students.  In the Web we can learn what a great \ncultural center Spain is, especilly in literature a nd paintings.  Men like \nVelazquez, Goya, Quevedo and Cervantes got their inspiration in this country.  Books \nmainly talk about the history and that is sometimes boring. In the Web I learned that \nlooking things up can be fun because most of the information is current and \ninteractive.  By clicking on a map of Spain you could get information on a specific \nregion.  For example <A href=\"http://www.uji.es/Spain-www.html\"><b>Spain</b></A> the \nhome page offers you different e-mail addresses to establish correspondance with \nsomeone in the universities there.  What a better way to get hands on information \nabout the style of life the Spaniards live.  Furthermore as students, university \ninformation is available and it tells you the different  programs they are offering \nin the different regions.  What I enjoyed more about being able to answer this \nquestion was looking at the tourist information they have available.  Take a look at \nthe <A href=\"http://www.eunet.es/hotels/index.html\"><b>Guia turistica de \nEspana!.</b></A> Here you have access to information such as a brief version of the \nhistory, places to visit and information about the food.  Unfortunatelly the only \nprovice available is Madrid, but I'm sure soon enough more information will be \navailable.</p>\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>How can you find interesting information within the field of social sciences? </B></A>\nIs easy to find information in the field of Social Sciences, is a matter of going into \nthe web's virtual library in <A \nhref=\"http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-SocSci.html\"><b>Social Sciences</b></A> and you \nhave more information there than in any other source I have worked with.  Social \nSciences is a very general field covering anything from Asian Studies and Museums to \nissues from the United Nations.  A topic I was interested in exploring was the United \nNations so I linked to the Virtual library <A\nhref=\"http://www.undcp.or.at/unlinks.html\"><b>United Nations</b></A> and read about \nthe Red Cross, the Childrens fund in Singapore and trading points.</p>\n<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>How can one create a page to view in Mosaic?</B></A>\nIs a simple thing to do.  You need to create your document by using HTML (HyperText \nMarkup Language).  This is the language the computer will use to interpret what you \nare telling it.  It requires you to follow specific rules to \"tag\" or \"mark\" parts in \nthe document.  It may at times be frustrating to follow these rules, one missing tag \ncould distort the document but once you learn them, is easy.  Another advantage to \nusng the HTML form is that it is compatible with any browser so anyone can have \naccess to you file being able to retrieve it from any browser not only Mosaic.  To \nlearn how to create a HTML document you can access the James Pollell introduction to \n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/html-jpowell/\"><b>HTML.</b></A> Once you \nread it and learn how to creat the document then you are ready to make your own home \npage and access it through Mosaic.  a demo document for <A \nhref=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/demo.html\"><b>Mosaic!</b></A>is available.  \nOnce you create a document using the web is twice as fun.</p>\n<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>Where can you find sources in Spanish to practice reading as well as learn about other places where the official language is spanish?</B></A>\nI have found that most of the sources that you find in the web from another country are \nin the language of the country that is  being presented.  I turned my attention in \nthe home page for <A href=\"http://lanic.utexas.edu/las.html\"><b>Latin American \nStudies</b></A> her you find a list of different countries that you can explore.  For \nexample <A href=\"http://lanic.utexas.edu/la/Argentina\"><b> Argentina!</b></a> detailed \ninformation can be found about the history, geography, government and currency.  Is \nalso possible to find out about the current events in the country of choice.  For \nexample <a href=\"http://www.igc.apc.org/nacla/mexico.html\"><b>Mexico</b></a> in this \narticle you  find the different issues Mexico is currently involved in.  For example \nthe presidential elections that just passed.  This page provides a picture of the \ncandidates as well as an abstract of the issues.  Keeping up with current events is \nhard but keeping up with current events from another country is double the trouble \nand the web makes it easy.</P>\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 08, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
