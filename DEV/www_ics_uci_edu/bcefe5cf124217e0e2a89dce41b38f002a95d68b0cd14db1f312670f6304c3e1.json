In an ideal world, everyone will adhere to one\nstandard for mail headers - RFC822 possibly, but X.400 is more likely.\nUntil that glorious day arrives (if it ever does), mailers at the mail\n'gateways' between networks will have little option but to munge\naddresses because of incompatible mail headers and addressing formats.\n\nWhat you mail system should do is rewrite mail headers into the\nappropriate form for transmission to a given host. In short, if your\nuucp neighbours only understand bang-style addresses, you mailer should\nonly present bang-style paths to these sites. If some sites understand\nRFC822 (user@host.domain), then you should send them RFC822 style mail.\nWhat would be less easy for the mailer is separating your bang-stlye\nuucp neighbours from those who understand RFC822.\n\nThe best mailers (MMDF or sendmail - no flames please!) take an input\naddress, convert it to a canonical form and then rewrite the address in\nthe appropriate style for the message transfer agent. This is the most\nsensible way of dealing with hybrid addresses like A!B@C. [Does that\nmean send by uucp to A for relaying to user B on host C or does it mean\nsend to C for them to relay to user B on uucp host A? Then what if C\n(or A) doesn't like addresses with '!'

Basic premise: gov't\n>project constructs an android according to eccentric scientist's specs; and-\n\n>C.Chiesa\n\n  Yea, verily, I recall The Questor Tapes. I've forgotten the scientist's\nname, but he was a very rich and secretive genius known for several major\nadvances in robotics and cybernetics. About 2 years previous to the start\nof the movie, he had disappeared, leaving only a partially completed project\nhe called Questor. Much of the work was complete, including a small fusion\nreactor, most of the brain, and a lot of the support machinery. He also left\na BIG mag tape of programs, which some government idiot had partially erased\nwhile trying to decode it. Questor, when activated, did nothing; the team\nthat assembled him figured it was because of the bad tape.\n\n  Late that night, Questor got up, used the 'finishing' molds to give himself\nhuman features, and walked out. The scientist had known one member of the\nQuestor-assembly team and put his name and address on the program tape; by\ngood fortune it had survived the attempted decoding. Questor knows only that\nhe must find `a boat' -- other details have been erased.\n\n  The government catches up with them in a playground and some fool shoots\nQuestor. Apparently the shock knocks some bits loose because when he sees\na jungle gym that looks like Noah's Ark he remembers, \"the boat, the boat\nof legend. [whatsisname] is waiting for me there.\" He also remembers that\nif he doesn't find the scientist within about two days, his fusion power\nsupply is programmed to overload and blow up.\n\n  They patch him up and he leads them a merry chase to Mt. Ararat where he\nfinds his creator in a cave hidden by a force barrier/hologram projection.\nThere is a long row of metallic slabs suspended about a meter above the\nfloor; on each lies a defunct robot. Each one wears clothing from a time\nfar earlier than the next. Questor's creator lies on the second to last\nslab, still conscious but unable to move.\n\n  These robots have been watching over the human race for more than ten\nthousand years. Each one lasts two hundred years, then builds his successor.\nQuestor's predecessor was brought to an early end by some combination of\npollution and radiation exposure; he has provided Questor with extra\nshielding so he will last the full two centuries.\n\n  Questor is the last. By the end of his term, the human race will have\nreached a point where we can make our own decisions without guidance.\nThe robots were placed here by some advanced aliens to see us through our\nracial childhood, to allow us a chance to mature and achieve whatever\npotential we have.\n\n  The Questor Tapes was an excellent movie, one makers of more recent films\nshould take a lesson from. Very few other movies have impressed me as much\nas \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" and \"The Questor Tapes\". They show up the likes\nof\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" and \"E.T.\" for the vapid silliness\nthey are.\n\n-------------------------------\n          Dave Lewis    Loral Instrumentation   San Diego\n\n  hp-sdd --\\     ihnp4 --\\\n  sdcrdcf --\\      bang --\\   kontron -\\\n  csndvax ---\\   calmasd -->-->!crash --\\\n  celerity --->------->!sdcsvax!sdcc3 --->--->!loral!dml  (uucp)\n  dcdwest ---/                 gould9 --/\n\n-------------------------------\n#! rnews 1384\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!ukc!its63b!hwcs!jack\nFrom: jack@cs.hw.ac.uk (Jack Campin)\nNewsgroups: rec.arts.sf-lovers\nSubject: Re: M.

I don't\nplay guitar, and was just along for the curiosity, but I've got a few comments\nto make and a question about what I consider to be a MIDI bug in one of the\ninstruments.\n   Firstly - the performance of the MG500. I wasn't actually playing it (I was\njust pushing buttons on the MT-32 instead), but I was impressed with its\nspeed and tracking ability - it was fast and followed pitch accurately,\nresponding to pitch bend and so on; it generally sounded pretty tight.\nThere were a couple of things I didn't like - but maybe it's a generic\nweakness of all guitar-to-MIDI systems. Firstly, the guitar transmits\nvelocity information (hit the string harder -> louder/brighter note), but\ngives no control (other than pitch-bend) once a note's sounding - there's\nnothing equivalent to aftertouch/modulation so once a note sounds you're\nat the mercy of the synth until you stop the string.\nPoint two - You've got six strings, so you can only sound six synth voices.\nThis is probably obvious, but playing a guitar patch through MIDI doesn't\nsound like a real guitar, because each touch of a string retriggers the voice\non that string, sometimes in a rather distracting way. On a real (classical)\nguitar you have the resonance of the soundbox to hang on to notes so you\naren't aware of this (I presume - comments?)\nNow for what is (in my opinion) a MIDI Bug! Play two different notes on\ntwo strings and you get two voices - ok so far. Play the same note on two\ndifferent strings and you get one voice. Humm. Play two different notes on\ntwo strings and slide one note up to the other, and one of the voices is\nchopped off. I think this is a bug - something somewhere doesn't want to\nthe same note more than once. Needless to say, this completely screws up\na number of guitar chords.\n   We mentioned this to the guy in the shop. He seemed convinced that it's\na problem with the MIDI spec. itself - if you play a keyboard synth, you\nhave to release the middle C key to play it again, don't you? I think this\nis a load of dingos kidneys - if I send my D-50 two separate middle C\nnote on messages, then I'll get two voices cycling through the envelopes at\nmiddle C pitch. This is what happens with the sustain pedal on, as well.\n   What's the verdict, net people? I think the guy was wrong (quite adamant,\nbut wrong...) and there's a bug in one of the boxes. I suspect the MG500.\nIf the MT-32 is anything like the D-50, then it doesn't care about playing\nthe same note twice. (A quick note in passing that synths with less voices\n(Juno106 for instance) often won't double a voice, in an attempt to play\nchords properly without running out.)\n-- \nNick Rothwell,\tLaboratory for Foundations of Computer Science, Edinburgh.\n\t\tnick%lfcs.ed.ac.uk@nss.cs.ucl.ac.uk\n\t\t<Atlantic Ocean>!mcvax!ukc!lfcs!nick\n~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~\n\"Nothing's forgotten.

The above will not work as it stands\nbecause the command syntax for execmail is not the same as smail. This\ncan be corrected by swapping the meaning of the -F and -f switches in\nsmail (main.c and defs.h).   The local delivery macro in defs.h should\nbe set to give /usr/lib/mail/execmail.com -f from to.   With this\nsetup you get the sco mailer (mailx) and smail with both From and From:\nlines correct.

These might be OK for sauces (yeah, the\n>   snootier gourmets wouldn't want anything to do with them) but they\n>   would obviously be horrible to drink.\n\nI think that these wines would be particularly bad for sauces that require\nwine as a major component and require reducing the wine. There are two\nreasons that come to mind:\n\n1) What is normally labeled as cooking wine is usually wine that is not good\nenough to sell as table wine. If the taste is not the best, reducing it will\nonly concentrate its flaws.\n\n2) Cooking wines contain salt. Reducing a cooking wine will concentrate the\nsalt. This could really ruin the sauce. \n\nThere best reason I have seen for using a good wine to cook with was given\nby Alexis Bespaloff in the \"New Signet Book of Wine\", which states\n\n \"Furthermore, it is actually uneconomical to buy cheap wine for cooking.\n  Say that an elaborate lobster dish calls for a spoonful or two of sherry\n  to heighten its flavor. A cook who runs out to buy a bottle of cheap\n  sherry will diminish the taste of an expensive and time-consuming dish with\n  a quarter's worth of wine. What's more, because the wine is a poor example\n  of its type, it may not be enjoyable to drink, so the spoonful of wine has,\n  in fact, cost the full price of the bottle.\"\n\nThat is fairly sound reasoning. Of course, the last sentence does not\nnecessarily follow. You could keep the cheap wine around to diminish several\nmeals.\n\nBTW, I recommend the \"New Signet Book of Wine\" to anyone who wants to learn\nmore about wine. It is available for $4.50 as a paperback. Quite a value\nwhen you compare it to the $20-or-more, glossy coffee-table wine books out\non the market.\n#! rnews 1809\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!enea!luth!d2c-usg\nFrom: d2c-usg@sm.luth.se (Ulrik\"Rick\"Sandberg)\nNewsgroups: rec.music.misc\nSubject: Re: Yes and ELP questions......\nKeywords: Tales from Topographic Oceans\nMessage-ID: <435@psi.luth.se>\nDate: 4 Dec 87 18:28:34 GMT\nReferences: <748@augusta.UUCP> <434@psi.luth.se>\nReply-To: Ulrik\"Rick\"Sandberg <d2c-usg@psi.luth.se>\nOrganization: University of Lulea, Sweden\nLines: 28\nUUCP-Path: {uunet,mcvax}!enea!psi.luth.se!d2c-usg\n\n\nIn article <434@psi.luth.se> I wrote:\n>In article <748@augusta.UUCP> bs@augusta.UUCP (Burch Seymour) writes:\n>>been looking for Tales on CD without success.

Can\n   something be done about that?\n\n3) Now let me come to the point.\n   In article <3051@batcomputer.tn.cornell.edu> eacj@batcomputer.tn.cornell\n   (Julian Vrieslander) he writes:\n>Konar than goes on to comment about the \"arrogance\" of audiophiles who still\n>prefer analog recordings to digital.

A technology not being perfect\n, or getting close to that, is still worth a discussion. Remember that it\ntook about a 100 years of thorough research from Edison's first grammophone\nto the modern high quality turntables. Don't expect digital audio to be\nperfect now only a few years after its introduction, no matter what the\ncommercial guys say. They are only interested in your hard-earned $$$$.\n\nUntil now I have only been in the opportunity to make a good comparison\nbetween a high-end turntable and some first genaration. I'll summarize\nthe pros and cons of which I think are important and which I can think of\nnow. Many of them are well known, others may not.\n\nPROS OF ANALOG:\n- Cheap records.\n- As John Vrieslander mentioned: More real, more spatious, more delicate,\n  more emotionally involving. I won't try to find other words for this\n  description 'cause I can't think of a better one. Unfortunately, this\n  can only be heard on good, say > $2k-$3k systems without an infinite\n  number of knobs, lights and other gadgets normally found in aeroplane\n  cockpits.\n\nCONS OF ANALOG:\n- More hissy, rumble,scratches,sound degrading after many times of\n  playing the record. This counts less when you have good records\n  (Japanese ones are most often excellent but hard to get now.) and take\n  good care of them.\n- No flat frequency response, especially at the low and high end.\n- Phase distortion.\n- Harmonic distortion increases with amplitude.\n\nPROS OF DIGITAL:\n- Longer durability than records (?). Less hissy, no rumble or ticks of\n  scratches.\n- Almost no phase distortion, flat frequency response within the audio\n  range.\n- Easy to use.\n- Slightly (!) more dynamic. Why only slightly? Well, the 96 dB dynamic\n  range theoretically possible with a CD is not very practical. In reality\n  it is compressed, as far as I know, to some 40-60 dB depending on the\n  music (Pop, Jazz, Classic) because:\n  a) No one wants to run continuously to his volume knob to adjust the\n     volume.If not compressed the music will either be banging through your \n     living room and of your neighbours or it will drown in the inevitable \n     background noise.\n  b) Studio equipment has a dynamic range of less than, say, 70 to 80 dB\n     when you assume the Signal to Noise ratio being equal to the dynamic\n     range.\n  c) Sound gets to distorted at low levels. (See also cons)\n  d) A dynamic headroom of 10 dB is desired.\n  With all this limitations the dynamic range of CD's is not much different\n  with that of a good record.\n- Excellent bass response. Deep and well defined.\n- Very stable stereo image.\n\nCONS OF DIGITAL:\n- Expensive records.\n- When listening to a CD, it seems as if there is no \"space\" around around\n  the instruments and voices. It sounds cold and not very lively.\n- First generation players and the cheaper CD players nowadays suffer from\n  very distorted high tones. They sound harsh. Cymbals for instance sound\n  like someone is sawing them into pieces instead giving it a gentle hit\n  with a drum-stick. They do not sound crisp and clear.\n- Distortion increases dramatically with lower amplitudes (!). It can be\n  more than 1.5 % at low levels. And it's a very nasty kind of distortion.\n- CD players produce (digital) noise above the audio range. This noise itself\n  can not be heard but other audio equipment may suffer from intermodulation\n  distortion which brings this noise back in the audio range. \n- Many CD players, especially the first ones, do not seem to be very reliable\n  mechanically.\n- I've heard that digital audio recording is quite different from analog.\n  I mean in terms of how it has to be done properly. I don't mean the\n  equipment needed, that's quite obvious. Not all studio crew seem to know\n  how to make a good digital recording. Does anyone know more about that?\n\nWell, this must be enough stuff to think and talk about.\n\nThe above mentioned cons of digital audio may be overcome in the latest\nplayers but I have not had the opportunity until now to carefully listen\nto them and to compare them. According to some serious audio magazines\navailable here in Holland they seem to be improved. Many top-of-the-line\nmodels now have separated power supplys for the digital and analog\ncircuitry, opto-couplers between those circuits, an additional analog filter\nto filter out > 20 kHz noise, 16 bit with with n times oversampling, stable\nand rigid chassis and improved error correction. All this may have solved\n(some) of the cons I mentioned but I'm not sure. Players which have one or\nmore of these improvements and thus may be of interest (At least for Julian\nVrieslander and me) are: Philips (Magnavox in the USA I believe) CD 650 and\nCD 960, Nakamichi, Mission, Meridian and if memory serves me well, Acoustical\nResearch (Or Audio Research. Don't know anymore). The latter two may be\ndifficult to get in the USA, they are made in the UK. No doubt that there\nare more good CD players but can't think of others now. These are the\nplayers I consider buying when normal LP's are no longer available.\n\nPooh! That was more than I intended to write but still far less than I can\ntell about this stuff.\n\n                                        Kind regards from\n                                        Jan Postma\n\n\nAnd on the seventh day, God went surfing!\n#! rnews 1424\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!cernvax!ethz!heiser\nFrom: heiser@ethz.UUCP (Gernot Heiser)\nNewsgroups: comp.emacs\nSubject: Setting terminal-emulator's environment\nKeywords: GNU Emacs function `terminal-emulator'\nMessage-ID: <261@bernina.UUCP>\nDate: 5 Dec 87 13:42:37 GMT\nReply-To: heiser@ethz.UUCP (Gernot Heiser)\nOrganization: ETH Zuerich, Switzerland\nLines: 18\n\n\nUsing the  GNU emacs terminal-emulator   to run interactive  programs  would be\nquite limited if the parent emacs  can't be used  for editing (when the program\nrun under the emulator starts up an editor).

He talks about fusion and \nthe mentions groups that belong(ed) to the symphonic-rock genre. (I prefer\nthat term instead of \"progressive\") For me \"fusion\" is a synonym with \njazz-rock. Anyway, that is more of question of semantics, the two genres \nhave a lot in common. (The main difference maybe being that symphony-rock \nis European and fusion American.)\n\nThe reason why these groups are being discussed the most is probably that\nthey have gained the greatest commercial succes. This may or may not \nbe correlated to the fact they are the best. \n\n>Doesn't (didn't) anyone listen to\n>some of the (apparently) lesser-known fusion greats?

It's\na real mixture Grady presents and I must admit there are names I have \nnever heard. Anyway, I think he is a bit unfair, some of them have \ncertainly been discussed on the net. For instance, I posted a discograhpy \non Brand X some month ago. Some comments to the other names:\n  PFM (Premiata Forneria Marconi) have been mentioned from time to time,\nthe Italian answer on Genesis, which developed in a different way. Now\ndisbanded, I believe. One day or another may be I'll post a discography.\n  Quiet Sun. The band in which Phil Manzanera played before he joined\nRoxy Music. Their \"Mainstream\" is rather like jazz, but not mainstream.\n  Seventh Wave. This is the name I never expected to see on the net! I\nbought their \"Things to Come\" when I was 15 and I was really fond of it\nthen. These days I don't find that amount of synthesizers so exciting as\nI did then.\n  Wheather Report. Quite well-known. But really, you do only need \"Heavy\nWheather\", the one with \"Birdland\". May be some more, \"Mysterious Traveller\"\nperhaps, but then you'll find that they all sound the same.\n\n>As I said before, I find much of Yes and ELP to be very dull, and un-\n>affecting.  I like Rush, though more live than on record.  \n\nAs you can guess, I don't share Grady's view here. Yes has made good\nmusic, yet never really touched my soul, probably due to their utterly\nstupid and semi-religious lyrics. \"Brain Salad Surgery\" is a very good\nrecord, the rest of what ELP have done is so-so. Rush don't turn me on \nat all, on the other hand. The net discussion inspired me to try \n\"A Farewell to Kings\" (A random choice). May be I would have liked them \n10 years ago, but not today with those lyrics and that voice.\n\n>So, were Yes, ELP, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Genesis and Rush really \"it\"\n>as far as most progrock fans go, or did some of these \"lesser known\" artists\n>(and all the others I forgot or never knew) filter out to larger audiences?\n\nDepends on how you define your terms here, but I can easily think \nof more groups, some of them succesful, some of them not, some of them\ngood, some them not so good:\nKansas, Saga, Asia, Jethro Tull, Roxy Music, Gentle Giant, Van Der Graaf\nGenerator, George Duke, Billy Cobham, Al DiMeola, Herbie Hancock, Dixie\nDregs, Ange, (Mahavishnu) John McLaughlin, Santana, Bill Bruford etc\n  I think that most of these people have had their share of the discussion\non the net. So to conclude, I do not really share Grady's initial obser-\nvation. However some particular groups are certainly being over-discussed,\nnamely Rush, Yes and recently also Pink Floyd.\n-- \nErland Sommarskog       \nENEA Data, Stockholm    \nsommar@enea.UUCP        \n                   C, it's a 3rd class language, you can tell by the name.\n#! rnews 916\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!enea!tut!santra!clinet!waldo\nFrom: waldo@clinet.FI (Tuomas Siltala)\nNewsgroups: rec.music.synth\nSubject: Siel DK80 sequenceer\nKeywords: How to use?\nMessage-ID: <553@clinet.FI>\nDate: 5 Dec 87 21:36:23 GMT\nReply-To: waldo@clinet.UUCP (Tuomas Siltala)\nOrganization: City Lines Oy, Helsinki, Finland\nLines: 17\n\nMy friend bought a Siel DK80 synthesizer and now he is wondering how\nthe sequencer in that machine works.\n \n \nUnfortunately we don't have any manuals for it.\n \nCould somebody kindly send me information concerning this problem?\n \nThank you!\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n  Tuomas Siltala                                 Internet: waldo@clinet.FI\n  Kalevankatu 51 B 37\n  SF-00180 Helsinki, Finland                     Telephone: +358-0-6947735\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#! rnews 1655\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!enea!luth!d2c-czl\nFrom: d2c-czl@sm.luth.se (Caj Zell)\nNewsgroups: rec.music.misc\nSubject: Re: Black Sabbath songs\nMessage-ID: <437@psi.luth.se>\nDate: 6 Dec 87 01:38:40 GMT\nReferences: <1208@gumby.wisc.edu> <3590@h.cc.purdue.edu>\nReply-To: Caj Zell <d2c-czl@psi.luth.se>\nOrganization: University of Lulea, Sweden\nLines: 25\nUUCP-Path: {uunet,mcvax}!enea!psi.luth.se!d2c-czl\n\n\nIn article <3590@h.cc.purdue.edu> acu@h.cc.purdue.edu.UUCP (Floyd McWilliams)\nwrites:\n\n>\tWhile we're talking about Sabbath, does anyone know who does the\n>vocals on \"Solitute\" (from the Master of Reality album) and \"It's All Right\"\n>(from Technical Ecstasy)?

A large number of\npackages exists for AT&T's 6300 Plus, an 80286-based system running V.2.\nThese can be run on 80386-based systems while you're waiting for\nsoftware authors to come up with native 80386 ports of their products.\n\n\t\t\t\tProblem\n\nYou are supposed to load packages onto your 6300 Plus using the system's\nadministration procedures.  These handle weird multi-volume cpio diskette\nsets, which are a pig to load unless you have the installation software.\nWhich you don't if you're trying to load the software onto an 80386-based\nsystem running 386/ix, Microport, or whatever.\n\n\t\t\t\tSolution\n\nHere's a shell script which does the job.  If you want to know the details,\nit reads 350k, starting at offset 9k, from each 360k diskette in the\ninstallation set, piping the result into cpio -c.  It the fires off the\nInstall program which should be part of the application package.  As the\ncomments remark, there's not a lot of error checking, as it's essentially\na quick hack.  Also, testing is about at the ``worked twice in a row''\nlevel.

If your current directory is in a sideways relationship\nto root, this assumption will no longer be valid.\n\nThe modified pwd algorithm should work like this:\n\n(1) Go up the tree with .. from your current directory until you\nfind / or reach the base of the tree (a directory which is its own\nparent).\n\n(2) If you didn't reach / in (1), then starting from / go up to\nthe base of the tree with .. and prefix the appropriate number of\n/..'s to the string from (1).\n\nFor example, after cd /../../C/D, step (1) will give /C/D and step (2)\nwill give /../.. so the answer is /../../C/D.\n\nThis is relatively straightforward to implement. I've made the necessary\nmodifications to the System V /bin/pwd and sh (which has a built-in pwd)\nfor use with a kernel implementation of the Newcastle Connection.\n\nThe tricky bit is getting the shortest possible pathname. For example,\nif / corresponds to /../../A/B in the global naming tree, then after\ncd /../C, the modified pwd algorithm would give /../../A/C which is\ncorrect but redundant. (/../../A is the same as /.. if / is /../../A/B).\n\nThis can be fixed if you keep a record of everywhere you visit in (1) and\nstop in (2) when you reach somewhere you've visited before, but since in\nan infinite naming tree this would require an infinite amount of storage\nand isn't very efficient in any case, it is easier to simply implement\nthe algorithm given (which also requires an infinite amount of storage\nin the general case of course!) and ignore this problem.\n\nRobert J Stroud,\nComputing Laboratory,\nUniversity of Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nARPA robert%cheviot.newcastle@nss.cs.ucl.ac.uk\nUUCP ...!ukc!cheviot!robert\nJANET robert@newcastle.cheviot\n#! rnews 835\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!ukc!dcl-cs!nott-cs!pyr1.cs.ucl.ac.uk!awylie\nFrom: awylie@pyr1.cs.ucl.ac.uk\nNewsgroups: comp.sys.ibm.pc\nSubject: Re: Standard date bug\nMessage-ID: <39500002@pyr1.cs.ucl.ac.uk>\nDate: 4 Dec 87 13:58:00 GMT\nReferences: <7457@eddie.MIT.EDU>\nLines: 12\nNf-ID: #R:eddie.MIT.EDU:7457:pyr1.cs.ucl.ac.uk:39500002:000:432\nNf-From: pyr1.cs.ucl.ac.uk!awylie    Dec  4 13:58:00 1987\n\n\nI have a Taiwanese XT clone with some strange BIOS and MSDOS 3.2 and the\nbug has annoyed me some time.

I'm told\nthat VMS (but it's a good idea for all that...) provides a stack of error \nvalues which allows a program to search backward to find out what the \"real\" \nerror was, depending on what kind of detail is required. If you have several\nlevels of library calls between you and the system call that failed, this\ncan be extremely useful- it's not really much use having an error-value\nif you can't even tell what system call it came from (let alone what parameters\nwere *passed* to that system call to cause it to fail!).\n\nA *decent* error-returning mechanism would describe:\n\n\t1. What call (syscall or library call) failed.\n\t   This could be a number- you could use something like internet\n\t   addressing to put some kind of structure into it:\n\t\tlibc.stdio.fopen\n\t2. Why it failed.\n\t   Simple E-numbers will do for this (although I suppose they'd\n\t   have to be grouped for different libraries):\n\t\tE_STDIO.E_CANNOT_OPEN_FILE\n\t3. What value it returned.\n\t\t(FILE *)NULL\n\t3. What parameters were passed to it.\n\t   This is the most difficult one, because it would have to have\n\t   some kind of idea as to the types involved. It could (I suppose)\n\t   deal only with string types (and convert any other type into\n\t   \"printable\" form by doing the equivalent of sprintf()'ing it).\n\t   It also has to be a \"list\", which means it would probably have\n\t   to be done using something like \"argc,argv\":\n\t\targc: 2\n\t\targv: \"mumble.splat\", \"r\"\n\nIf the error is not \"dealt with\", then this information should propogate\ndown (together with the info from the callee's failure), and so on...\n\nSo, If you do a\n\tfopen(\"mumble.splat\",\"r\")\nand it fails, then the following would be left on the stack (in some format\nor other) to be dealt with by some error-diagnosing function:\n\n\tkernel.open:\n\t\tparam 1: \"mumble.splat\" [string]\n\t\tparam 2: 0 [int]\n\t\treturns: -1 [int]\n\t\terror: E_KERNEL.ENOENT\n\tlibc.stdio.fopen:\n\t\tparam 1: \"mumble.splat\" [string]\n\t\tparam 2: \"r\" [string]\n\t\treturns: 0 [FILE *]\n\t\terror: E_LIBC.E_STDIO.E_CANNOT_OPEN_FILE\n\nThe error-diagnosing stuff could then print something *useful* such as\n\tstdio fopen: couldn't open file \"mumble.splat\" for reading, because:\n\t    kernel open: no file or directory \"mumble.splat\"\n\n(and of course the format of these messages could be user-configurable, so\nthat noddies would just get the information they need, whereas people who\nunderstand what they're doing could get reams and reams of info- just by setting\nsome environment parameter to the appropriate value).\n\nOf course, all this stuff would have to be known by the compiler, and I'm sure\nit'd be dead slow to execute!\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------\n| Simon Brown                                    |\n| Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science |\n| Department of Computer Science                 |\n| University of Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.         |\n--------------------------------------------------\n UUCP:  uunet!mcvax!ukc!lfcs!simon\n ARPA:  simon%lfcs.ed@nss.cs.ucl.ac.uk      \"Life's like that, you know\"\n JANET: simon@uk.ac.ed.lfcs\n#! rnews 665\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!henk\nFrom: henk@cwi.nl (Henk Schouten)\nNewsgroups: rec.games.board\nSubject: diplomacy\nKeywords: pbm\nMessage-ID: <138@piring.cwi.nl>\nDate: 7 Dec 87 08:36:16 GMT\nOrganization: CWI, Amsterdam\nLines: 9\n\nA local group is going to start a diplomacy game by mail.

The points where the left and where the\nright \"bar\" are evaluated are implementation defined. The problem is similar to\nanother one, which a friend of mine had some time ago. He tried to pack as much\nas possible into the control part of a while loop using the following statement:\n\nwhile (a[i]=b[i++])\n  ;\n\nThings were even worse here, as the program behaved even differently depending\non whether it was compiled with the optimization option or not. Non optimized\neverything worked as expected but in the optimized version only for the first\nassignment \"i\" was incremented after the assignment, for all the following\nassignments it was incremented after the evaluation of \"b[i]\" but before the \nassignment. Nevertheless this behaviour was in the sense of both K&R and ANSI.\nThe only thing you can trust on, is that the *operand* of the increment\noperator is evaluated before its incrementation. One way to achieve the desired\nbehaviour is, as you suggested yourself, to write:\n\n> What he really wanted was the equivalent of\n> \tbar->tmp = bar;\n> \tbar++;\n\nand not (for the same reasons stated above):\n\n> \t(bar++)->tmp = bar;\n\nIf there is any necessity to have the whole semantic in one *expression*, use\nthe comma operator, as\n\nbar->tmp = bar, bar++;\n\nThis operator *guarantees* the sequential evaluation of its operands from\nleft to right.\n\nIn real life: Dipl.Ing.

For instance, a struct with an array in\n\t   the middle:\n\t\tstatic struct foo table[] = {\n\t\t\t{ ...... {.....} ......},\n\t\t\t...\n\t\t}\n\t   The compiler complains about mismatched braces.\n\t   Cure: 'unwrap' the struct declaration, so it's all at the\n\t\t same level.\n\n\t2) In a construct like\n\t\tbar *p = (expression1, expression2);\n\t   the result of expression2 gets coerced to int, and then\n\t   back to bar *, meaning basically that you get bombs on the\n\t   screen when you try to use p, due to a wrong address.\n\t   Cure: use\n\t\tbar *p = (expression1, (bar *) expression2);\n\n\t3) We believe that 'complicated' initialisations to auto\n\t   variables in functions (for instance where the\n\t   initialisation involves a call to another function) often\n\t   come out wrong. However, by this point, we despaired, and\n\t   stopped using the compiler, so we never followed up on it.\n\nI might point out that we're trying to compile a BIG program: 30,000\nlines of C, so just trying to trace bug 2 took us a LOT of time.\n\nBy the way, just for interest: to compile the lot from scratch, using\na ram disk for temporaries would take 4 hours.

Some day, if I ever get around to\nproducing V1.3 of MINIX, I will make a tree of the current version next to\nthe V1.2 tree, and then run this program to get a list of all files that\nare different.  Then I can make diff listings etc.  In reality, the reason\nI wrote it however, is that I had just copied my MINIX tree from one part\nof the disk to another, and I wanted to make sure nothing was forgotten.\nI am sure there are other uses as well.    One could no doubt write a shell\nscript to do this same thing, or perhaps use find, but this program is\nmuch faster, being able to compare two 8 megabyte trees in about 12\nminutes on a Z-248.\n\nPlease post any bugs you find.\n\nAndy Tanenbaum (ast@cs.vu.nl)\n\n----------------------------- treecmp.c ---------------------------------\n/* treecmp - compare two trees\t\tAuthor: Andy Tanenbaum */\n\n/* This program recursively compares two trees and reports on differences.\n * It can be used, for example, when a project consists of a large number\n * of files and directories.

At that address it inserts a list of memory\npieces to be used. If you use new ROM's these addresses have been changed\nso you cannot use FOLDRXXX unless you figure out the new address you need\nand substitute the necessary information into the binary of FOLDRXXX ( or\na disassembly ). On the other hand: the new version of the ROMs for the\nMega has a much larger OSpool from which these memory blocks are taken.\nIt used to be 6000 bytes, but the new size is 16000 bytes.

I\ngive below another proof.\n\nFor n>0 let\n\nT(n) = x^a(n)/n^3\tand \tU(n) = T(3n) + T(3n+1) + T(3n+2)\n\nand for k>=0 let\n\nZ(k) = sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} T(n)\n\nWe have\n\nZ(k+1)\t= sum {n=3^(k+1) to 3^(k+2)-1} T(n)\n\t= sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} [T(3n) + T(3n+1) + T(3n+2)]\n\t= sum {n=3^k to 3^(k+1)-1} U(n)\n\nLet us compare U(n) to T(n). We have a(3n)=a(n)+1 and a(3n+1)=a(3n+2)=a(n).\nThus\n\nU(n) = x^[a(n)+1]/(3n)^3 + x^a(n)/(3n+1)^3 + x^a(n)/(3n+2)^3\n\nand so U(n) has as upper bound\n\nx^a(n) * (x+2)/(3n)^3 = T(n) * (x+2)/27\n\nand as lower bound\n\nx^a(n) * (x+2)/(3n+2)^3 = T(n) * (x+2)/(3+2/n)^3\n\nin other words U(n) = T(n) * (x+2)/(27+e(n)), where e(n)<(3+2/n)^3-27 tends to\n0 when n tends to infinity. It follows then that\n\nZ(k+1)= Z(k)*(x+2)/(27+f(k))\n\nwhere f(k)<(3+2/3^k)^3-27 tends to 0 for n tending to infinity.\n\nNow the series is the sum of all Z(k). Thus for x>25 we have Z(k+1)>Z(k) for k\nlarge enough, and the series diverges; for x<25 we have Z(k+1)< r * Z(k) (with\nr=(x+2)/27<1) for every k, and the series converges. For x=25 the series\ndiverges too (I think so), because Z(k+1)/Z(k) tends to 1 for k tending to\ninfinity.\n\nChristian Ronse\t\tmaldoror@prlb2.UUCP\n{uunet|philabs|mcvax|...}!prlb2!{maldoror|ronse}\n\n\t\tTime is Mona Lisa\n#! rnews 1248\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!botter!star!sater\nFrom: sater@cs.vu.nl (Hans van Staveren)\nNewsgroups: comp.dcom.lans,comp.sys.ibm.pc\nSubject: Need info on hardware Western Digital EtherCard PLUS\nKeywords: moron suppliers, Ethernet, IBM PC's\nMessage-ID: <608@sater.cs.vu.nl>\nDate: 8 Dec 87 14:11:10 GMT\nOrganization: V.U.

I have tried sending the comments privately, but have had\nno reply.\nI got a Kinetics internal Ethernet interface for a Mac SE, plus the\nethernet driver, test software and NCSA telnet version 1.12.\nIn order to try out this software in a safe manner I created a mini-\n-Ethernet with the Mac and an Ethernet monitor. Am I glad that I did\nthis!\nThe test software, when run, tends to throw out a large number of\nbroadcast packets in a very short space of time. Sometimes one can\ncontrol the frequency, other times not. At least one test threw out\nabout 200 broadcast packets in much less than one second. If I had\nbeen on the real CERN Ethernet then a few hundred users would have\nhad to deal with these!\nFLAME ON\nWhen will people writing test software avoid the intensive use of\nbroadcast packets? Multicast would be slightly better, but even then\nthe software should establish the address of those other computers\nwith which it can run a test, and then address them directly.\nFLAME OFF (for a while)\nI then tried to run NCSA telnet. This also started out with about\n70 immediate broadcasts. These started out with a set of three\ntypes of broadcast:\n  1. arp with source ip address 0.0.0.255, looking for 0.0.0.127\n  2. something with type field 80f3 (what the hell is this?)\n  3. some other arp-type (type field 809b) with sender as 0.0.0.127\nThese three are repeated about 20 times at intervals of about\n10 milliseconds (yes, milliseconds!). There are then a few more type\n809b broadcasts at reasonable (a few hundred milliseconds!) intervals\nbefore telnet starts to arp for the real host that I asked for.\nFLAME ON\nWhy does software often insist on repeating packets at very short\nintervals on vey reliable LANs (and have you seen the Sun lately!)?\nFLAME OFF\nDespite all the above, I waited for a quiet moment before connecting\nonto the real Ethernet. I then tried telnet to our Ultrix Vax.\nImmediate remark: keyboard in application mode does not work for us.\nI then thought to run the vt100 test program (which some of you might\nalso have picked up off usenet). What a disaster: the emulation fails\nall over the place!\nNever mind, let us see if I can connect to our IBM VM system. Of course,\nI have to go via a Spartacus KNET, because there is no NCSA tn3270\n(is anyone working on this?). Complete failure: Spartacus has a bit of\na peculiar telnet setup (though Ultrix, bsd4.2 and FTP Inc. telnet on\na PC work fine) which seems to screw NCSA telnet.\nFinal try: go through an IBM 7171 front-end, which has 3270 to VT100\nbuilt in. Sort of works (using ESC n for PF key n), but since the\napplication keypad mode fails there is no way that I could get PA2\nfor clear screen. Merde (which the French will understand.\nFLAME ON\nI know that NCSA is now at version 2.0. Why did I get version 1.12\nfrom Kinetics? (and why must only a Kinetics agent modify their Mac SCSI\nbox for a European power supply?). How do I get an updated version\nquickly (no, I cannot do anonymous FTP!). Why have these simple tests\nnever been reported before? etc. etc.\nFLAME OFF\nI would be delighted if someone could tell me that all the above problems\nare fixed in the current release!\n#! rnews 1102\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!cernvax!ethz!wanner\nFrom: wanner@ethz.UUCP (Juerg Wanner)\nNewsgroups: rec.games.misc\nSubject: Re: The Pawn help\nMessage-ID: <263@bernina.UUCP>\nDate: 8 Dec 87 14:48:50 GMT\nReferences: <2884@cbmvax.UUCP> <2299@killer.UUCP> <2910@cbmvax.UUCP>\nReply-To: wanner@owf.UUCP (Juerg Wanner)\nOrganization: OWF AG, Switzerland\nLines: 17\nKeywords:\n\n\nIn article <2910@cbmvax.UUCP> daveb@cbmvax.UUCP (Dave Berezowski) writes:\n>How does one assure that they get the chest?

When we speak -\nor spoke at that time - of \"progressive\" groups, we talked of groups\nthat played quite regular rock or pop. There were just one difference\nto the ordinary hit music, the lyrics. They were naive, trivial and \nuttermost boring political texts of a communistic nature. (Which does\nnot imply that they were paid by KGB or something.)

The disadvantage, of course, is\nthat you smash the applicative behaviour of the language -\nwhether it's worth it depends what you're trying to do.\n   Another way around this is to use type abstraction. That way, your\nstate structure is an abstract object with a few access functions to get\nat the bits you need. I've always used the former approach, so I don't know\nhow far the latter approach gets you. It's quite possible to take non-\napplicative features like assignment and abstract over them to build\nstructured objects with varying state, a la Smalltalk perhaps. This isn't\n\"dirty\" functional programming - it's just using a functional language as if\nit were a language of a different kind. I recently dedicated a lecture to the\nstructured use of side-effects in ML.\n   By the way, I have various little typecheckers and interpreters for tiny\nfunctional languages lying around on-line somewhere, if you're interested.\nAll written in ML, of course.\n-- \nNick Rothwell,\tLaboratory for Foundations of Computer Science, Edinburgh.\n\t\tnick%lfcs.ed.ac.uk@nss.cs.ucl.ac.uk\n\t\t<Atlantic Ocean>!mcvax!ukc!lfcs!nick\n~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~ ~~\n\"Nothing's forgotten.

This one confused me,\nand I *understand* the address of an array. (Just teasing)\n\nTo put it another way....\n\nAny object, of any type (integer, structure, array, etc.), has an address.\nUsually, if it is an object that occupies several words of memory, it is the\naddress at which it begins. (Compiler theorists may be itching to tell me it\nmight mean something else entirely; let's keep this simple.)  The address of\nan object is the compiler's handle for manipulating it.   You think of an\nobject by its name; the compiler \"thinks\" of it by its address.\n\nThe \"address of an array\" is the address that the compiler uses to access\nthat array and to calculate the position of any element in the array.\n\nIn C,  the address of an array is the same as the address of its first\nelement (array[0]).  If you want to set up a pointer to the array, you\nget its address simply by naming it. Hence:\n\n\tpa = array;\t/* pa now contains the address of \"array\" */\n\nwhich is exactly the same as\n\n\tpa = &array[0]; /* \"&\" means \"address of\", so pa contains the\n\t\t\t\taddress of element [0] of \"array\" */\n\nNow this is a slight quirk in C - the name of the array being a synonym for\nits address;  for any other object (notably a struct) that is not true.  If\nyou want the address of a structure you must write\n\n\tps = &mystruct;\t/* NOT ps = mystruct */\n\nSo we get back to the discussion from whence we came: why can't we be\nconsistent and get the address of an array by\n\n\tpa = &array;\t?\n\nTo which the answer is:  you can, with some compilers.\n\n[Further reading: The C Programming Language; Kernighan & Ritchie; pp.93-95]\n--------------------------\nCharles Lambert\n#! rnews 1652\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!unido!iaoobelix!vogt\nFrom: vogt@iaoobelix\nNewsgroups: comp.sys.dec\nSubject: Bug in BASIC-PLUS for RSTS V8.0? - (nf)\nMessage-ID: <9900003@iaoobelix.UUCP>\nDate: 8 Dec 87 18:36:00 GMT\nLines: 43\nNf-ID: #N:iaoobelix:9900003:000:1342\nNf-From: iaoobelix!vogt    Dec  8 19:36:00 1987\n\nI think I found a bug in BASIC-PLUS of RSTS V8.0.

The answer to which method\nshould be used ultimately depends on what the purpose of the estimations\nis. \n\nIn fact, if the purpose is to estimate y for a given x, then ordinary\nleast squares will do. In this case one is not really interested in\ngetting the best estimates of the parameters but only in getting a good\nprediction.\n\nI claim that there are very few regression examples where one really\ncares whether or not the parameters are biased. In the large majority of\ncases one is much more interested in the goodness of prediction. In this\ncase, one is interested in E[Y|X]. So if we model this quantity as\nlinear in X, then the OLS estimates are BLUE. This will also give\nvariances etc, all valid conditionally on X.\n\nIt is my feeling that a lot of books overemphasize the so-called bias,\nsince that is very often totally irrelevant.  For example, some\ntextbooks talk about biased parameter estimates when some variables\nare missing in a multiple regression. In reality OLS is estimating a\nbetter set of parameters than would the corresponding \"unbiased\"\nestimator (OLS in this case will give an unbiased estimate of the best\nsurface based on the reduced set of variables). Certainly in this case,\none can make a strong argument that all the talk about biasses is\ntotally irrelevant.\n\nOf course if the true purpose is to estimate parameters, e.g. to assess\nthe effect of a change in X on Y, then indeed one needs to worry a bit\nabout the effects of X being random.\n\nGunnar\n\n-- \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGunnar Stefansson                       {mcvax,enea}!hafro!gunnar \nMarine Research Institute, Reykjavik    gunnar@hafro.UUCP\n#! rnews 528\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!unido!tub!ao\nFrom: ao@tub.UUCP (Arnfried Ossen)\nNewsgroups: comp.mail.misc\nSubject: Path to UMass Amherst\nMessage-ID: <318@tub.UUCP>\nDate: 7 Dec 87 13:29:49 GMT\nReply-To: ao@tub.UUCP (Arnfried Ossen)\nOrganization: Technical University of Berlin, Germany\nLines: 7\n\nAnybody out there who knows the PATH to\n\n   University of Massachusetts, Amherst Campus, COINS Department\n\nIt should allow access from USENET or BITNET.\n\nArnfried, ao@tub.UUCP, ao@db0tui6.BITNET, TU Berlin, Berlin, Fed.Rep.Germany\n#! rnews 2902\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!varol\nFrom: varol@cwi.nl (Varol Akman)\nNewsgroups: sci.math\nSubject: Re:   computational geometry / finding segment intersections\nSummary: Try adaptive grid ...\nKeywords: segment intersection\nMessage-ID: <141@piring.cwi.nl>\nDate: 9 Dec 87 11:14:57 GMT\nReferences: <4369@sdcsvax.UCSD.EDU>\nOrganization: CWI, Amsterdam\nLines: 50\n\n<4369@sdcsvax.UCSD.EDU> maiden@sdcsvax.UCSD.EDU (VLSI Layout Project) writes:\n>\n>Consider a path embedded into the Cartesian plane, where for convenience\n>all vertices of the path are lattice points in the positive quadrant.\n>All edges are line segments.\n>So, the path will look like < (x1,y1) , (x2,y2) , ... , (xn,yn) >.  \n>Question:    What is the fastest method of determining *ALL* self-\n>\t     intersections of this path?\n>This may have been beaten to death by computational geometers, so I'll\n>append some extra conditions:\n>Suppose there are **many** vertices in the path, and that edges are\n>for the most part very short.

You may look at the books by Shamos\nand Preparata, and also the book by Edelsbrunner for references.\n\nMy favorite method to solve your problem though is an excellent\nmethod invented by Randolph Franklin at RPI.  It is called ''adaptive\ngrid'' and works as follows.  First you overlay a regular, say G by G\ninteger grid on your scene.  Then you enter your edges into respective\ncells of the grid  (similar to the bucketing idea!)  Then you make a pass\nthru all the cells and find the intersections in each cell.  If an\nintersection falls on a grid cell boundary you should be careful to\ntreat it so the integrity is kept intact.\n\nI'm not very good in describing things in a hurry (especially Email)\nbut let me tell that I've wide experience with this stuff and it works\nvery well.

The form in which\ninformation is stored must be the most flexible possible, or you lose\ninformation.  The D-crate's pitching of conditionals is simply the\nmanifestation of this.\n\nProponents of restrictive protocols for information storage really ask\n\"the world\" to change to fit the protocol model.  In science, models\nchange to fit the data, not the other way round (unless you cheat).\nTo me, browbeating eventual non-conformists into \"catching up\" by\nlabeling the a model as \"advanced\" is just a form of negative\nmotivation.  All the lousy places I have ever worked ran on negative\nmotivation, none of the good ones.  If your model *is* really worth\nusing, and you can communicate its value, you will not need such\ntactics. \n\nInteractively defined functions?  Haven't typed one in *years* -\nthat's what scratch buffers are for (in case I want to change a\n*character* or two, or later save it.).\n\nAny mouse-based gadgets you can point to in Interlisp can be recreated\nfor a text editor working on correctly parsed Lisp code.  May  take\nexecution time, but if this is prohibitive, your function is probably\ntoo large. \n#! rnews 2319\nPath: alberta!mnetor!uunet!mcvax!ukc!its63b!jha\nFrom: jha@its63b.ed.ac.uk (J Andrews)\nNewsgroups: rec.games.frp\nSubject: Fantasy Philosophy\nKeywords: wackafoo\nMessage-ID: <824@its63b.ed.ac.uk>\nDate: 10 Dec 87 14:30:15 GMT\nReply-To: jha@lfcs.ed.ac.uk (J Andrews)\nOrganization: Univ. of Edinburgh Dept. of Computer Science\nLines: 38\nGod: Kate Bush\n\nLeast-favourite-subject: domain theory\n\n\n\n     Those interested in the issues surrounding the mechanics and\nphilosophy of fantasy worlds should read Tolkien's (non-fiction)\nessay \"On Fairy-Stories\".  It appears in the collections _Tree and\nLeaf_ and _The Tolkien Reader_.\n\n     One of the main ideas behind it is that the fantasy author or\nstory-teller is a \"sub-creator\", who tries to create a \"secondary\nbelief\" (rather than exactly a \"willing suspension of disbelief\")\nin the reader.  In the fantasy that works, the reader should be\nable to enter the world every time she picks up the book, and not\nbe aware of the world as being constructed by the author.  This\ninvolves not only internal consistency, but a lack of gimmickry.\n\n     For instance, in _Lord of the Rings_ I was never aware of\nanything being in the world gratuitously.  (Others may differ! :-))\nIn _The Sword of Sha-Na-Na_ (sic)(sick?), on the other hand, I was\nvery aware of the Elfstones as being just a gimmick to get the\ncharacters out of tight spots.  Sure it was internally consistent\n(the Elfstones only had any effect in times of direst need for\ntheir holders), but the hand of the author was clearly visible.\n\n     Similarly, applying it to FRPG's, the magic system in AD&D is\ncertainly internally consistent (to the extent that it is described),\nbut just doesn't \"work\" for me.  Having MU's able to remember several\ncopies of a spell, but forgetting it when the last copy is cast, is\nobviously a gimmick to limit the number of spells an MU can use.\n\n     So I guess the moral of all this for FRPG or module designers\nis that it's best to start out with a few basic assumptions and build\nup your world from them by fairly believable steps, and if you can't\navoid ending up with something really hairy, then change one of your\nassumptions rather than put in quick kludges.

(If you just try to 'take pedestal',\nyou are told that it is too heavy to lift.)  I'm told that this results from\na bug in the relevant object definition table entry, so it might have propagated\nto other versions.

Although the time period sounds a bit long these rules have the\nfollowing advantages (My opinions only).\n\n- Wide ranges of troops covered (You can fight outside Europe)\n- Wide range of weapons covered (Pikes for those Moscow Militiamen etc)\n- Simple solution for combat - This is what I really like, There@s\n      No nonsense evaluating every 20th of a casualty, or evaluating\n      grenadier companies firing separate from the rest of their battallion.\n- All weapons are handled simply. Just a different entry in one table.\n- Movement is alternate, not simultaneous, things move much quicker.\n- Hand to hand combat is decided very quickly, (Just like reality).\n- Morale tests are also quite fast to do, and give specific tests for\n  different situations. (This avoids an old problem where eg Horsemen test\n      morale before charging, Test fails horribly, Horsemen rout off the \n      field.)

Maybe I'm wrong??!\n\nThere are a number of ancient submarine designs, including one which was a\nrowing boat with a watertight cover! The first practical submarine was (I\nbelieve) designed by a Mr. Holland, resident of Ireland, for use against the\nRoyal Navy. The Royal Navy took over the design, but regarded such concealed\nwarfare as ungentlemanly, and didn't make much use of them until Germany\nshowed the way.\n\nThe jet plane was invented practically at the same time by Britain, Germany\nand the U.S.A. Germany had the first flying jet aircraft, followed closely by\nBritain. Britain would have had a jet fighter not long after the Battle of\nBritain except for government intervention. Fortunately, Hitler was equally\nstupid. The Nazis believed they would win the war in a couple of months, and\ngave little interest to projects which would bear no short term military\nresults. When they did get the world's first jet fighter (the Me262) it was\npretty devastating, albeit rare, until Hitler decided that it would make a\ngreat fighter-bomber. Two bombs were fitted under the nose, at the expense\nof two cannon and much speed and agility. Fortunately, Nazi policy was \"if\nit doesn't work, stomp on whoever says so.\" The first American jet was too\nlate for WW2, and the first Russian jet had a captured German engine.\n\n>    As for the NASA/Space shuttle saga, the sooner they pull their fingers out\n> the better.
