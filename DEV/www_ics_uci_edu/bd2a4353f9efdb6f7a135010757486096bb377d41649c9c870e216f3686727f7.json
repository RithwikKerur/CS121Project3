Richardson and Margaret. C. Thompson in\n<i>Proceeding of the Second Workshop on Testing, Verification and Analysis</i>,\nBanff Canada, July 1986.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nRELAY, a model for error detection, defines revealing conditions that \nguarantee that a fault originates an error during execution and that the \nerror transfers through computations and data flow until it is revealed. \nThis model of error detection provides a fault-based criterion for test\ndata selection. The model is applied by choosing a fault classification, \ninstantiating the conditions for the classes of faults, and applying them \nto the program being tested. Such an application guarantees the detection \nof errors caused by any fault of the chosen classes. As a formal model of\nerror detection, RELAY provides the basis for an automated testing tool. \nThis paper presents the concepts behind RELAY, describes why it is better \nthan other fault-based testing criteria, and discusses how RELAY could \nbe used as the foundation for a testing system. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:41:02 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
