The\nexperimental results to be reported here show that generalized\nlinear models are an effective machine learning tool and that the\nclassifiers inferred via these models are frequently much more\naccurate than those inferred by conventional decision tree methods.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
