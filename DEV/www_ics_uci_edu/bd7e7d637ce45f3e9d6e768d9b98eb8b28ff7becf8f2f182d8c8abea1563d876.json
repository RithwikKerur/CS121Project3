We begin with a brief description of the problem context, and\ndefine what we mean by semi-valid. The majority of the talk will focus on a\npaper by Bernardini, et. al, for the automatic reconstruction of CAD models\nfrom unordered point sets using alpha-shapes. We will define the alpha-shape\nand present some of its properties, such as how it is a generalization of the\nconvex hull of a set of points.  We will also present conditions on the\nsampling rate that, if achieved, guarantee that the reconstructed solid is\nhomeomorphic to the original and is within a specified accuracy. This is\nfollowed by the reconstruction algorithm, which proceeds as follows: 1)\nProduce an initial triangulation of the points using alpha-shapes, 2)\nSimplify the mesh, making it suitable for p-element analysis, 3) Fit smooth\nsurfaces to the mesh. We conclude by showing how additional information is\navailable in the context of semi-valid CAD models and present several\npossible avenues for additional research.\n<P>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
