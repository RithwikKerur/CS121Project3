There were 55 people in\nattendance.  The meeting was chaired by Jim Whitehead, and minutes\nwere taken by John Stracke, Stephen Martin, and Jim Davis.\n\nJim Davis presented on the Advanced Collections requirements document;\nhis slides are available at:\n\n<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/chicago/ietf42acr.html>\n\nThe Advanced Collections requirements document is currently in WG Last\nCall.  There were several issues raised concerning these requirements:\n\n* There may be a requirement to be able to create a reference where the\n  owner designates the destination as not visible.\n\n* Should there be a choice about whether deleting the target of a direct \n  reference also deletes all (direct) references.\n\n* Should access control of references be distinct from those of the target.\n\n* Should the owner of a resource should be able to prevent creation of\n  references to it using access control facilities?  This would affect\n  requirements for access control, not advanced collections.\n\n* Is there a need for references that pass some but not all operations.\n\n* The documents need to be more clear on whether a reference is to a\n  resources or to a URI.  Furthermore, the language defining a member \n  of a collection is not very precise in describing what a member is \n  (Resource vs URI).\n\nJim Davis next presented on the Advanced Collections protocol document.\nSome modifications to the protocol were discussed:\n\n* Add a new property dav:references, which provides backpointers from\n  a target to all resources that refer to it.\n\n* Redefine DAV's semantics for MOVE to insert a step between the COPY\n  and the DELETE.  This inserted step, called UPDATE, updates any\n  references to the resource, if possible, changing the ref-target\n  property to reflect the new location.  This resolves a conceptual issue\n  of when referential updates are performed when MOVE is defined as a\n  COPY (which doesn't update references), followed by a DELETE.\n\n* Remove the \"dav:passthrough\" property, instead, just define a\n  dav:reftype property which takes either dav:direct or dav:indirect \n  values. The rationale for this change is the dav:passthrough \n  property would have allowed client to create paradoxical references, \n  e.g. ones which pass through GET but not HEAD. For a useful direct \n  reference, there seems to be only one sensible set of values for \n  what should be passed through, and what not, namely:\n\n  affect target:\n   GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, PROPFIND, PROPPATCH\n  affect reference:\n   DELREF, DELETE, COPY, or MOVE\n\n  except that the returned headers from GET and HEAD include extra\n  headers (Ref-Type and Ref-Target) added by the reference itself,\n  which thus allow the client to discover that the reference is a\n  reference.\n\n* A question was raised concerning whether a direct reference can point \n  to a direct ref?  Yes.  All the Ref-Type and Ref-Target headers are \n  returned.  This is sufficient for the client to determine where the \n  reference points to.\n\n* Since the DELETE method deletes a reference no matter what type, there\n  is no need for the special DELREF method.\n\nThe ordered collections part of the document was skipped because Jim\nDavis ran out of time.  However, ordered collections were discussed at\na breakout session on the Advanced Collections Protocol, held in the\nafternoon on Wednesday, August 26.  Issues raised at this meeting\nconcerning ordered collections:\n\n* The LOCK method must also take headers for assigning initial\n  position in ordering, because a LOCK on a non-existent resource\n  creates (at least temporarily) a new member of a collection.\n\n* Rename the dav:arbitary ordering value to dav:custom.\n\n  Some feel that the name dav:custom better reflects the meaning of a\n  collection that is ordered, but where the ordering is ad-hoc and\n  known only to a human.\n\n  It allows for four possible conditions of ordering\n   1) Not supported on server.  No orderingtype property.\n   2) Supported, but this collection is not ordered.  dav:unordered\n   3) dav:custom\n   4) Some other URL\n\n* Allowing the ORDERPATCH method to modify the position of more than one\n  resource at a time was discussed.  Though objections to this were raised \n  at the Redmond meeting, noone at the breakout session could remember the\n  rationale for this objection.\n\nLisa Dusseault Lippert presented on Access Control Goals, and her\nslides are available at:\n\n<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/chicago/access_control/>\n\nSome discussion over the scope of this protocol: are we creating a\nmechanism to manage underlying, pre-existing ACLs, or are we creating\na mechanism to manage DAV-specific ACLs? Consensus seems to be that\nthe latter is the case.\n\nIssues raised during the presentation are:\n\n* Should ACLs apply to properties, and should properties have access rights\n  scoped to an individual property.\n\n* Requirements should mention where and when the WebDAV access control\n  facility relates to access control faclilies of other protocols.\n\n* It should be a goal of the protocol to have a simple interitance\n  mechanism. Dynamic vs static may not be necessary.\n\nChris Kaler presented results from the Raleigh meeting of the\nVersioning and Variant Authoring design team.  His slides are\navailable online at:\n\n<http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/webdav/chicago/versioning/>\n\nThere was some discussion over why/whether versioning needs to support \ndownlevel clients.\n\nJim Whitehead opened discussion on whether we need to do configuration\nmanagement or not.  Previously the WG said no; the versioning design\nteam feels that versioning without CM wouldn't be too useful, so we\nshould do something simple, at least.  Consensus seemed to be that CM\nis going to be necessary for many customers, but a burden for some\nothers, so we should aim for a versioning protocol that can subset to\nleave out the CM.\n\n*** Meeting Adjourned ***\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
