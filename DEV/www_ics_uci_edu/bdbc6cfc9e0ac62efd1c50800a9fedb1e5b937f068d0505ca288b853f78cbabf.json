One promising approach for reducing \ncode size is to employ a \"dual instruction set\", where \nprocessor architectures support a normal (usually 32 bit) \nInstruction Set, and a narrow, space-efficient (usually 16 \nbit) Instruction Set with a limited set of opcodes and \naccess to a limited set of registers. This feature\nhowever, requires compilers that can reduce code size by \ncompiling for both Instruction Sets. Existing compiler \ntechniques operate at the routine-level granularity and \nare unable to make the trade-off between increased register \npressure (resulting in more spills) and decreased code size. \nWe present a compilation framework for such dual instruction \nsets, which uses a profitability based compiler heuristic \nthat operates at the instruction-level granularity and is \nable to effectively take advantage of both Instruction Sets. \nWe demonstrate consistent and improved code size reduction\n(on average 22%), for the MIPS 32/16 bit ISA. We also show \nthat the code compression obtained by this \"dual instruction \nset\" technique is heavily dependent on the application \ncharacteristics and the narrow Instruction Set itself.\n<p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<table cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td valign=\"left\">\n      Center For Embedded Computer Systems,<br> \n      Department of Information and Computer Science,<br>\n      University of California, Irvine.\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
