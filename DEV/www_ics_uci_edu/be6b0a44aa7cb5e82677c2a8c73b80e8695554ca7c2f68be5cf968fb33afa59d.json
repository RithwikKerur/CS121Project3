The most recent ranking came in August from the 2015 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) by the Center for World-Class Universities at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Out of the top 200 computer science programs in the world recognized by ARWU, the ICS computer science program was ranked 29th. &#8220;This is great news because it&#8217;s consistent with the <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> global ranking that had our computer science program as No. 23 in the world,&#8221; says Hal Stern, Ted and Janice Smith Family Foundation Dean of ISC.

A compilation of 33 different styles for writing programs and designing systems, the book, released last summer, can be used in conjunction with a <a href=\"https://github.com/crista/exercises-in-programming-style\">GitHub-hosted repository</a> of code. In the review, <i>SD Times</i> columnist Larry O&#8217;Brien calls the book &#8220;the best programming book to come along in many years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As previously reported by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, Lopes wrote her book as a response to a recurring programming student problem. While students could write code that worked, they often had no idea how to structure it, leaving their work difficult to decipher and vulnerable to bugs. Lopes' book resolves this issue through a series of constraints: It takes a simple computational task and demonstrates 33 different ways to possibly structure it. &#8220;Every programmer will find some styles that trigger a happy recognition and others that cause an intriguing confusion. Every chapter is a delight,&#8221; O&#8217;Brien writes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I made an effort to write a book that is both informative and fun,&#8221; Lopes says in response to the review. &#8220;It's very rewarding to see that people are getting my message!&#8221;</p>\n<p>At the review&#8217;s end, O&#8217;Brien commends the book further: &#8220;I honestly cannot think of a more enlightening and more valuable text that&#8217;s been published since the turn of the century,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;The hardest part about reviewing it is coming up with a way to say &#8216;Every developer should read this book&#8217; in a way that doesn&#8217;t come across as clich&#233;d and rote.

The co-principal investigators for the project include Informatics Professor <strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong>, Chancellor&#8217;s Professor of Computer Science <strong>Gene Tsudik</strong>, and Associate Professor of Cognitive Science Bruce Berg.</p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s technology allows, and sometimes requires, people to engage in security-critical tasks in often distracting public spaces. For example, a user may need to enter a PIN, enter a password, or solve a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) on his smartphone in distracting settings. According to the group&#8217;s proposal summary, &#8220;User errors or delays while performing security-critical tasks can lead to undesirable or even disastrous consequences.&#8221; The impact of such errors or delays has yet to be investigated. However, using a fully automated experimental setup, this project will study whether and how sensory stimuli influence users&#8217; behavior and trigger mistakes.</p>\n<p>The project is in its preliminary stages, but, according to the professors, it entails two potentially transformational research ideas: &#8220;If sensory stimuli have a negative effect on users performing security-relevant tasks, its better understanding can lead to awareness and eventual countermeasures,&#8221; they say. &#8220;If, however, certain auditory stimuli actually improve user performance, new opportunities would arise for applying audio stimuli as a means of aiding users.&#8221; The work also &#8220;further explores the feasibility of conducting security-related user studies in a fully automated manner, which makes large-scale studies feasible and also avoids any potential experimenter bias.&#8221;</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/papp/gpg_2.jsp#IID2\">NSF website</a>, funding from the NSF EAGER program &#8220;may be used to support exploratory work in its early stages on untested, but potentially transformative, research ideas or approaches.&#8221; NSF EAGER-funded projects often entail radically different and experimental approaches to scientific research.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --></p>\n<p><a name=\"summer_2015_ICS Professors make Computing Reviews&#8217; Best of Computing notable books list\"></a><b>ICS Professors make Computing Reviews&#8217; Best of Computing notable books list</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"Computing Reviews&#8217; Best of Computing notable book\" height=\"72\" src=\"../../../bin/img/logos/cr_best_of_computing_notable_book.jpg\" width=\"72\"/></div>\n<p><i>Computing Reviews (CR)</i>, an Association for Computing Machinery/ThinkLoud publication, has released its <a href=\"http://www.computingreviews.com/recommend/bestof/notableitems.cfm?bestYear=2014\">19th Annual Best of Computing list</a>, a compilation of the most interesting books and articles published in 2014.

In a recent example, professor <strong>Sandy Irani</strong>, in collaboration with professor Shahram Ghandeharizadeh at USC, has developed several novel algorithms for managing key-value caches for database management systems that greatly reduce processing overhead and enhance system throughput.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this ranking data is an excellent recognition of impact the faculty in the center are having on the area,&#8221; Goodrich says.</p>\n<p>The list is currently a Beta version; the developers welcome feedback at <a href=\"mailto:csdepartmentranking@gmail.com\">csdepartmentranking@gmail.com</a>.</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<p><!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --></p>\n<hr/>\n<p><!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --> <!-- --></p>\n<p><a name=\"fall_2014_kobsa_nsf_user_privacy_decision_support\"></a><b>Kobsa receives $666,000 from NSF to research user privacy decision support</b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Alfred Kobsa\" height=\"90\" src=\"../../../bin/img/photos/faculty/kobsa.jpg\" width=\"70\"/>\n<p><b> Alfred <br/> Kobsa </b></p>\n</div>\n<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded informatics and computer science professor <strong>Alfred Kobsa</strong> $666,000 to research user privacy decision support.</p>\n<p>Even though consumers want to be in charge of their privacy and current privacy norms and research recommend transparency and user control, expecting all users to make all privacy decisions themselves turns out to be unrealistic. Kobsa&#8217;s proposal, &#8220;A User-Tailored Approach to Privacy Decision Support,&#8221; seeks to realistically empower users for privacy choices, through personalized default settings and through rationales for disclosure that best suit users&#8217; predicted decision-making.
