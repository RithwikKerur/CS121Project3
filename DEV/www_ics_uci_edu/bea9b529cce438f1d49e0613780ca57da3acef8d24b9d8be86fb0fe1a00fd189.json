As you know, you may not\n  copy commercial programs from the lab machines to use at home.  Likewise,\n  in an academic setting you may not turn in someone else&#39;s work as your\n  own.  (&quot;As your own&quot; is the key phrase:  If you use code from\n  the textbook or from your TA, you should include a comment indicating where\n  the code came from.  This is perfectly permissible unless an assignment\n  explicitly restricts what code you may use.  Joint work may be allowed or\n  required by an assignment, as we are doing with pair programming.  However,\n  using code from other students or from sources outside of the course is\n  not permissible in ICS H21 unless an assignment explicitly allows or requires\n  it.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>As a general principle, we expect you to do\nyour own independent work in all parts of this course.  In this course it\nis always permissible, even desirable, to talk with your classmates about\nthe conceptual course material or the requirements of an assignment (though\nthe instructor or TAs will be most reliable for this).  It is always permissible\nto get help from anyone about using the programming environment or other\nsystem details, help with minor syntax errors, or suggestions of possible\ntest cases for your programs (though when an assignment requires it, you\nmust write your own description of your test plan).  It is never permissible\n(except if an assignment explicitly allows or requires working in groups)\nto copy another student&#39;s solution (whether code, prose, or math). \nA good rule of thumb is this:  Any time you find yourself <I>writing down</I>\n(on paper or by electronic means) part of someone else&#39;s solution, you\nare copying impermissibly.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>Turning in another person&#39;s work as your\nown violates the honesty policies of ICS and UCI (</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/current/policies/index.php</code></A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>).\nThe School of ICS takes academic honesty very seriously and imposes serious\npenalties on students who violate its guidelines. Detected violations could\nresult in your failing the course, having a letter filed with the school,\nand losing a variety of other benefits and privileges.  We do check for\nacademic dishonesty both manually and automatically.  It is an unfortunate\nfact that nearly every quarter, some students in ICS classes are found to\nhave violated these policies; to protect the privacy of the guilty, violations\nare not made public, but sadly, they do occur.  No matter how much pressure\nyou feel from deadlines or other sources, no matter how inconceivable it\nis to you that you might not complete an assignment on time, <I>never</I>\ntake the shortcut of turning in someone else&#39;s code.  Compared to the\nconsequences of academic dishonesty, one low assignment score is a minor\ndisadvantage.  If you feel as if you&#39;re falling behind or have other\ndifficulties, see your TA or the instructor; we will help you work around\nyour difficulties.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>We do encourage all students to help their\nclassmates with the course material and the labs, within these limits. \nHelping someone else doesn&#39;t hurt your grade; we don&#39;t have any\nlimits on how many As or Bs we can give.  It is even permissible in ICS\nH21 to let someone else <I>look over</I> your code to get an idea of how\nyou organized it.  However, you should not let anyone <I>copy</I> your code,\neither on paper or electronically.  In fact, it is wise to keep your code\nin your own possession; if you give a copy to someone else, even if it&#39;s\njust &quot;for reference,&quot; that person might be tempted to copy portions\nof your code; then <I>you</I> could be accused of academic dishonesty. </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>Most importantly, realize that getting &quot;the\nanswer&quot; is only the last part of each assignment.  Equally important\nis the <I>process</I> of getting the solution&mdash;including the false starts,\nbugs, misconceptions, and mistakes&mdash;because the learning occurs in the doing.\n Completely apart from the ethical issues, copying a solution deprives you\nof the whole point of the assignment.</FONT><BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</P>\n<P>\n</P>\n<HR>\n<address>\n<FONT FACE=\"Palatino\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/\">David G.
