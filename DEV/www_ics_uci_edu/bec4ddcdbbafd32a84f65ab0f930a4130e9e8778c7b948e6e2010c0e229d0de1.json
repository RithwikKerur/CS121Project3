Richardson and Margaret C. Thompson in\n<i>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</i>,\nSE-19(5):327-344, May 1993.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nRELAY is a model of faults and failures that defines failure conditions, \nwhich describe test data for which execution will guarantee that a fault \noriginates erroneous behavior that also transfers through computations and \ninformation flow until a failure is revealed. This model of fault detection \nprovides a framework within which other testing criteria's capabilities \ncan be evaluated. In this paper, we analyze three test data selection \ncriteria that attempt to detect faults in six fault classes. This analysis \nshows that none of these criteria is capable of guaranteeing detection for \nthese fault classes and points out two major weaknesses of these criteria. \nThe first weakness is that the criteria do not consider the potential \nunsatisfiability of their rules; each criterion includes rules that are \nsufficient to cause potential failures for some fault classes, yet when \nsuch rules are unsatisfiable, many faults may remain undetected. Their \nsecond weakness is failure to integrate their proposed rules; although a \ncriterion may cause a subexpression to take on an erroneous value, there \nis no effort made to guarantee that the intermediate values cause \nobservable, erroneous behavior. This paper shows how the RELAY model \novercomes these weaknesses. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:41:24 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
