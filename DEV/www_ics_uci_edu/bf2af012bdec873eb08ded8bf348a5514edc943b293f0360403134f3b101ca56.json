In freshman calculus, the concept is\nextended to vector functions of a parameter. In both courses, some\nkind of substitution method is usually used. If a student goes\nfurther, he/she finds that substition methods had been extended\nlong ago, under the name of elimination theory, to a high level of\nsophistication. (See the famous <i>Theory of Equations</i>, by J.\nV. Uspensky, McGraw Hill 1948). It may therefore come as a surprise\nthat surface/surface intersection is still undergoing considerable\nresearch in the domain of Computer Aided Geometric Design.</p>\n\n<p>In this paper, we will present the progress in algorithms that\nhave been applied to intersecting two surfaces embedded in <b>\nR</b><sup>3</sup>, with varying degree of success. It will be shown\nthat this algorithm, which is central to the robustness of modern\nCAD systems, is inherently hard, not from the point of view time or\nspace complexity but due to</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The chaotic nature of the requisite non-linear numerical\nmethods, and</li>\n\n<li>The rich topology of intersection curves among intersecting\nsurfaces that occur in real world problems.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Practical, state-of-the-art methods for overcoming these\ndifficulties will be presented.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
