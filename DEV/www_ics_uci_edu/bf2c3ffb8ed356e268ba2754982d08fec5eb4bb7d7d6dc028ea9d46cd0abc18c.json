As a matter of \r\n\tfact, I think I once spoke to you when I was in NY visiting my brother, \r\n\tChaiim Baruch (Harry) Schonfeld.  Anyway, we've always heard from our \r\n\tfather, Moshe, A&quot;H, and from other relatives, that we were descended from \r\n\tthe Bnei Yissoschor.v  However, noone seems to know how.  I've asked and \r\n\tasked.  Some versions I've heard &quot;shtimt nisht&quot;.  Maybe because you've \r\n\tdone much more research than I have, and are more well versed with \r\n\tSeforim, you would know.\r\n    \r\n\tA 2nd cousin of mine, a Margareten (ben Hinda Schonfeld Margareten) \r\n\treportedly went to the Blushever, z&quot;l, andd asked him if we are related \r\n\tto the B&quot;Y and he answered &quot;Avada&quot; (certainly). \r\n\t\r\n    Also, to change the subject somewhat, could you tell me about the \r\n\tMiller-Schonfeld connection.  We had several occassions to speak with family \r\n\tmembers of Pesach Dovid Schonfeld, A&quot;H, but unfortunately all those \r\n\toccassions were when we or they were sitting Shiva.  We are related to that \r\n\tfamily through 2 different connections.\r\n    \r\n\tAnyway, here is our Yichus-please let me know what you know, and I will do \r\n\tlikewise:\r\n \r\n    My father:   Moshe Schonfeld                \r\n\t           + Pesel Lifshe Goldberger (a Lisker grandchild)\r\n      gfather    Chaim Baruch Schonfeld         \r\n\t           + Malya Weinberger\r\n     ggfather    Naftali Yeshaya Asher Schonfeld\r\n\t           + Esther Wohl, \r\n\t             Shprintza Shaindel Wohl (Hanucovce)\r\n    gggfather    Menachem Mendel Schonfeld      \r\n\t           + Sora Blima ?\r\n   ggggfather    Eliezer Schonfeld              \r\n               + ?\r\n \r\n                               Looking forward to hearing from you,\r\n                               Elizabeth Feder\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: &quot;Larry R.

Unfortunately, these\r\nhints have not helped me discover the answer, but nevertheless:\r\n(1)  In talking to my father A&quot;H's first cousin, she said she thought the\r\nconnection was through the mother.  The Wohl sisters, who were wives to\r\nNaftali Yeshaya Asher (I am named for them)  were descended from Shaul Wahl,\r\nthe Polish king for a day.  Their parents were Yaakov Yehuda and Rivka bas\r\nMoshe Chaim (maiden name unknown) Wohl.\r\n(2)  When I was in Israel this past summer, I met another branch of the\r\nfamily for the first time.  They are descendants of Naftali's brother\r\nYechiel Mechel Schonfeld, who lived in Uhely.  They said they did not get\r\nthe &quot;Kabbala&quot; that their branch stems from the B&quot;Y, but were knowlegeable\r\nthat that Naftali &amp; Yechiel's uncle, Moshe, was the B&quot;Y's son-in-law.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dates:\r\nMy father, obm Moshe Schonfeld, b. **** in Cz, d. Pesach ****\r\nGfather Chaim Baruch b, 1879, d. 1929\r\nNaftali Yeshaya Asher Schonfeld b. about 1840, d. Av, 1920\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nElizabeth Feder\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Louis Schonfeld\" <Lmagyar@en.com> \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: RE: Stropkov Schonfeld \r\nDate: Wed, 8 Nov 2000 08:47:21 -0500 \r\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook IMO, Build 9.0.2416 (9.0.2910.0) \r\nImportance: Normal \r\n\r\n\r\nThis too is in process.

The family has a Tzavah from NYA which states\r\nthat they are descendants of the B.Y. Not necessariyly from Moshe ben\r\nEliezer but from another daughter. Elizabeth Schonfeld Feder is their family\r\nhistorian. Her brothers Louis Schonfeld (Yekutiel) lives in Flatbush (less\r\nthan 5 minutes away from you) and Baruch Schonfeld also from Flatbush.

Herschel Newman is married to a Shusterman & living in Fla.\r\n\tAri passed away several yrs ago. \r\n\tI have Chana Mindel Uri's son listed as Shaya Naftali, not Naftali Shaya.If you\r\n\tdon't know of any family members to consult about this, I could probably find\r\n\tsomeone to ask, although I am not in direct, constant contact with them.My aunt\r\n\tis.\r\n    A key Q for you, which would hint at a lot of info:  Do you know who Naftali \r\n\tYeshaya (or reversed) was named after? Again, my Schonfeld Ggrandfather was\r\n\tNaftali Yeshaya Asher, and I don't know of an antecedent with that name, though\r\n\tI can go back 2 more generations.  What about the town of origin?  My Newman\r\n\tsource tells me the Newmans came from Uhely.\r\n    Also, your birthdate for NYH of 1888 seems wrong-or my dob for Ettel of 1863 is\r\n\twrong. Let's check on that if we can.\r\n    At this point I am still in the process of researching & entering Newman family\r\n\tnames.  \r\n                                                    Regards, Elizabeth\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Larry R.

For some reason,no one in the family knows the names of any of his \r\n siblings, just that Zvi was from Hungary and born somewhere in the 1820-30 range.\r\n Zvi had died by 1896 since the first child to my grandparents was a boy named Hersh \r\n Melech who died shortly after birth and was born in 1896. I know the names of a few \r\n of his siblings children who were my grandfather's age. One of his siblings sons\r\n (obviously a brother) was Abe Schonfeld who accompanied my grandmother here in 1912, \r\n June or so to New York  and two sisters, Esther Weisman and  Fannie Goldberg, who \r\n were about my grandmother's age so born about 1875 to another of his siblings but\r\n dont know if they were Schoenfelds by maiden name or not.\r\n\r\nMarge\r\n\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nCan we start in the beginning? Can you list (in age order?) the children \r\nfrom each of R' Zvi Elimelech's marriages?

Here is my Schoenfeld tree:\r\nI am Marge Neff Schechner, daughter of Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff. She is the\r\nyoungest of seven children of Moses (and Rose Schreier) Schoenfeld, who was\r\nborn in Boryslav(then Austria) in 1867, the 8th of 10 children of Tzvi\r\nElimelech and Bella Richter Schoenfeld. Tzvi had another wife before Bella\r\nwith whom he had two children who he left with his former in laws somewhere\r\nin Hungary. He then married Bella and had another 8 children with her. My\r\nTzvi antecendent died sometime around 1920. Since my grandfather, Moses,was\r\nthe 8th of 10 children, I can assume that Tzvi was born sometime around\r\n1825-1830. Unfortunately, I don't know the names of any of my grandfather's\r\nsiblings. He had a nephew named Abraham Schoenfeld, who was born about 1890\r\nand married a woman named Rose, and a niece named Esther who married a man\r\nnamed Moishe Weisman. They had 3 children named Irving,Hannah(born about\r\n1912) and Belle who married a man named Harold Cole(Cohen. Another niece was\r\nEsther Zukerman (born about1890) who married a man named Max Magid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarge Schechner\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nFrom: Louis Schonfeld &lt;Lmagyar@en.com> \r\nTo: &lt;moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: RE: Tzvi Elimelech Schonfeld - Were there TWO?! \r\nDate: Wed, 1 Nov 2000 07:45:49 -0500 \r\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook IMO, Build 9.0.2416 (9.0.2910.0) \r\nImportance: Normal \r\n\r\n\r\nMoishe,\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know where it fits.

Bertha was named for her grandmother, Bella Richter\r\nSchoenfeld, wife of Tzvi Elimelech.\r\nThere was a child born about two years before Bertha, named Harry(Hersh\r\nMelech or Tzvi Elimelech) born about 1896 or 97 but he died at age 6\r\nmonths.Bertha and Harry were born in Boryslav.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoses Schoenfeld was born in Boryslav in 1867.\r\nRose Schreier Schoenfeld was born in Drohobycz in 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no information regarding any of my grandfathers siblings. Family\r\nstory is that he was the 8th of 10 children born to Tzvi from his second\r\nwife, Bella. The first two children were from the first wife and were left\r\nwith her parents in Hungary when he married Bella. I have the names of\r\nseveral of Moses nieces and a nephew.\r\nAbraham Schoenfeld; accompanied my grandmother to the US in 1912 and was\r\nthen 22 years old. He married a woman named Rose and they had two children.\r\nEsther Zukerman Magid came here in October, 1912 on the Kaiser August\r\nVictoria with my mother's five older siblings. She married a man named Max.\r\nEsther Weisman, a niece, married to a man named Moishe. Had 3 children named\r\nIrving, Hannah (b.1912), and Bella (b.1906) married a man named Harold Cohen\r\nwho changed the name to Cole.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can only guess as to when Bella and Tzvi died since my grandparents named\r\ntheir first two children after them. My mother told me that Tzvi's yartzeit\r\nwas on 28 Tevet and I would assume that he had died by the time Harry was\r\nborn in 1896.Bella's yartzeit is 1 Shevat. Mom's only brother, Joseph, who\r\ndied in 1990 gave her this information.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarge\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease indulge me.

My mother is Sylvia Schoenfeld Neff, the 8th\r\nchild of Moses and Rose Schreier Schoenfeld. Her siblings are/were\r\nHarry (Hersh Melech)Schoenfeld,born about 1896 and died in infancy.\r\nBertha Schoenfeld Goldheir,born-1898, died-1973.\r\nRae Schoenfeld Weinstein,born-1900, died-1981.\r\nJoseph Schoenfeld, born 1902, died-1990\r\nMatilda Schoenfeld Teitelbaum, born-1904, died-1990\r\nLillian Schoenfeld Spitzer, born 1906\r\nHannah Schoenfeld Cukell, born 1913\r\nSylvia Schoenfeld Neff, born 1914\r\n\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, Moses, was born in 1867 in Boryslav to Tzvi Elimelech and\r\nBella Richter Schoenfeld. He was the 8th of 10 children. He died in 1944 in\r\nNew York City.\r\nMy greatgrandfather, Tzvi Elimelech had a first wife who died after giving\r\nbirth to two children who were left with his dead wife's family in Hungary.\r\nTzvi died sometime before 1896 since my grandparents named their first\r\nchild,Harry,for him. Bella died before 1898 since my Aunt Bertha was named\r\nfor her.\r\nUnfortunately, I do not know the names of any of my grandfather's siblings\r\nbut have several of his nieces' names and one nephew. Abe Schoenfeld, born\r\nabout 1890, married a woman named Rose and lived in New York after 1912.\r\nEsther Zukerman arrived in New York in 1912 and married a man named Max\r\nMagid. Esther Weisman was another niece, married to a man named Morris\r\n(Moishe) Weisman. They had three children; Irving, Belle ,born about\r\n1906,(who married Harold Cohen/Cole) and Hannah, born about 1912.\r\nThere is another name in the family tree, Dora Bien, wife of Henry Bien, but\r\nI do not know how she fits in.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarge Schechner\r\n\r\n___________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Sat, 20 Jan 2001 05:07:55 -0500\r\nTo: Schmuelik <rub1@owl-online.de>,lmagyar@en.com, Marge Schechner <momcactus@email.com> \r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: [Fwd: Schonfeld Slovakia]\r\n\r\nDear Shmuel, Marge and Louie,\r\n\r\nActually, after re-reading everything at\r\nhttp://www.familytreemaker.com/users/s/h/m/Rubens-Shmuel/PHOTO/0004photo.html\r\nand\r\nhttp://www.familytreemaker.com/users/s/h/m/Rubens-Shmuel/PHOTO/0005photo.html\r\n I can tell you based on the death entry on your site that Shmuel's \"Tzvi Hersh Schonfeld\" \r\n was 69 when he DIED (not born) on Feb 6, 1874, which corresponds to 19 Teves, 5634.

Bertha wrote of her great-uncle being married to a Roza Lehrer. \r\nThis family turns out to be descendents of PESACH MOSHE and BRACHA \r\nWeinberger. This means that the NECHEMIA that Bertha Schwartz and Dr.\r\nJudith Lobel come from had a sister named RIVKA. This Rivka married \r\nShmuel Lehrer and had Rosa (and others). \r\n\r\nI have been in touch with several descendents of Rivka, living in the NY \r\narea and Antwerp too. They also know that Rabbi Fischel Weinberger of Yad \r\nEliyahu in Israel and his brother Shmuel were cousins. Their father was \r\nYakov. He may have been either a brother or nephew to Nechemia and Rivka.\r\nThis connection is only a guess right now. I am trying to contact somebody \r\nfrom that family to find out the name of Yakov's father. \r\n\r\nSo, so far we have Brucha and Pesach Moshe with two children, Nechemia and \r\nRivka. They possibly had another named Yakov. Also, please remember that \r\nthe Bnei Yissochur (1783 - 1841) was named R' Hersh Meylech Spira. He was \r\nmarried to Chane Mindel, surname unknown. They had seven children. You can \r\nview this list at\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/bny-yscr.htm\r\n\r\nNow, getting back to bringing us altogether. Bertha wrote about some of the \r\nfamily going to Munkacz. Linda Cohen wrote about some Weinberg/er family that \r\ncame to the USA from Munkacz. Maybe somebody can supply more information on \r\nthis part.There may be some connection there. \r\n\r\nThere is the Pesach Moshe Koifman, that I am hoping lisadan@internet-zahav.net\r\nwill tell us about.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, Gail Furst wrote about a Hersh Meylech Weinberger who had\r\na daughter named Chana Mindel, born in Dubiecko. This family MUST be related, \r\nhaving the names of both the Bnei Yissochur and his wife in their family. \r\nPerhaps somebody can supply a contact to Moishe Gewirtz or some other family \r\nmembers from this branch. Also, Gail, can you supply an approximate time frame\r\nfor when Hersh Mylech Weinberger lived? It may be that he was yet another \r\nsibling to Nechemial and Rivka. \r\n\r\nGoing back to the beginning, once again, the parents of Nechemia and Rivka \r\nwere Pesach Moshe and Bracha. I have no proof as to which one was the \r\nWeinberger. In those days, it was not uncommon to only have a Jewish \r\nwedding ceremony, with no corresponding civil record. This would \r\nusually result in the children retaining the maiden name of the mother.\r\nIn our case, there are possibilities. It might be that Pesach Moshe was \r\nnamed after the father of the Bnei Yissochur, whose name was Pesach. It \r\nmight be that Bracha was the connection. If she was, it might be that she \r\nwas a daughter of Baila, who was the daughter of the Bnei Yissochur. There \r\nis no evidence that the Bnei Yissochur had more than the seven known children,\r\nBracha NOT being one of them. Also, given the dates involved, she would have \r\nbeen to old to have been his child. Of course, Bracha could have been almost \r\nany else's child too.\r\n\r\nI hope that we can work together to try and put more of this into place. I\r\nhave recorded much of out earlier emails and they can be found at\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/brknspir.htm\r\n\r\nI will try to review the ship records available at the Ellis Island website \r\nfor any possible new leads.\r\n\r\nPlease respond, at least to let me know your own thoughts on how to continue\r\nfrom here.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMoishe Miller\r\nmoishe@langsam.com \r\n__________________________________________________________________________\r\n</pre>\r\nFor an overview of Pesach Moshe and Bracha's two known children <a href=\"nchmwbrg.htm\">Nechemia</a> \r\nand <a href=\"rvkalhrr.htm\">Rivka</a>, please see their trees.\r\n<p>\r\n<strong>R' Fischel Weinberger</strong><br>\r\nIn Rabbi Meir Wunder's encyclopedia of Galician Scholars , II:824, he mentions \r\na (Ephraim) Fischel Weinberg (1912 - 1964).

He was a Mashgiach for meat\r\nIn 1960 they were in Crown Heights already but moved back in 65, until 72 to East Flatbush\r\nIn 1972 they moved to Boro Park on 18th and 50th.\r\n\r\nMoshe is the son of\r\nMalka Weinberger (sister to Phillip - he had no children) and Dov Gewurz (died in 1920). \r\nDov was a son of Moshe Gewurz, and ben-bais by Bluzower Rebbe.\r\nMalka and Dov had Moshe and also had 2 dtrs:\r\n* Hentcha or Esther (shot By Nazis in the very beginning of the war. She was evicted from \r\n  the house by the Nazis and she went back. They shot her).\r\n* other one is unknown, she died young and caused Dov's death.\r\n\r\nMalka passed away in Siberia\r\nHer father was Hersh Mylech Weinberger\r\n\r\nMoshe claimed he came from the URI mishpacha.\r\nAlso that Malka and Dov were first cousines, but the \r\nconnection to the Bnei Yissoschur was only based on Malka \r\n\r\nAfter Siberia Moshe lived is Estreich. \r\nHe married a Wasserstein who died during childbirth, with the child.\r\nShe has a sister, married to Binyomin (Yumtchi) Goldstein.\r\n\r\nMoshe's second wife is Perel Ganzfried, and they have Hersh Mylech (Harry). \r\nHarry lives at 777 Kent Ave, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, NY\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<A NAME=\"A5\"> </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<A HREF=\"#Q5\"><IMG SRC=\"../img/top.gif\" align=\"right\" border=0 height=31 width=19 ALT=\"\"></A>\r\n&#149; <strong>Pesha Horowitz/Stockholmer</strong><br>\r\nPesha Horowitz/Stockholmer (1894 - 1979) was married to Avrohm Zusha <strong>Ziskind</strong>. \r\nAccording to her family, she was a descendent of the Bnei Yissochur. \r\nIn an attempt to determine the connection, the following is presented. <p>\r\nPesha and Avrohm Zusha had three children; Sholom Ber, Leah, and Yechiel.\r\nPesha's parents were Dovid <strong>Horowitz</strong> of Estila, Galicia and Leah \r\n<strong>Halcer</strong> (c. 1878 - 1946).<br>\r\nPesha's two siblings were Mindel and Zissel<p>\r\nDovid's parents were Yechiel and Pesha Horowitz.

He did not know the exact connection but was hoping to learn it. I\r\nwas unable to help but thought maybe someone from our group could further\r\nidentify or add genealogical material. He related the following:\r\n\r\nHis wife, Rivka SIMON, is the daughter of Pinchus Shlomo SIMON and Perel\r\nEHRENFELD (1912 - 1994). This Perel was the daughter of Tzvi EHRENFELD and\r\nKreindel HAPLERIN (or HALPERT) of Mako, Hungary. Rabbi Weissberger believes\r\nthat the connection is probably via this Kreindel, whose parents were Yona\r\nZev Ha'Levi, the shochet in Mako, and Esther BERENSTEIN (daughter of Yakov\r\nYitzchok Ha'cohen and Margolit Rivka, also of Mako, Hungary). Yona Zev was\r\noriginally from Mukachevo before going to Mako. His parents were Akiva and\r\nEsther.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the Pinchs Shlomo SIMON mentioned above was the son of Moshe\r\nand Leah DEUTSCH, also of Mako, Hungary. \r\n\r\nIf anybody can shed more light on this family or there connection to R'\r\nHersh Mylech SPIRA, please contact me.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nMoishe Miller\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\r\nOn Sun, 23 Oct 2005 17:54:33 +0200\r\n\"Halpert Moty\" <halpertm@zahav.net.il> wrote:\r\n Dear Mr. Moishe Langsman\r\n Moaadim Le'simha\r\n\r\n My name is Mordehay Shlomo Yona Halpert, My father Moshe, His fathers' name Yaakov, \r\n His grand father Yona from Mako.

When I showed my \r\nfather your email, he said that the name Zvi Elimelech rang a bell, \r\nbut he's not sure.  My grandfather, Shlomo, had an older brother \r\nnamed Avraham, so I thought perhaps that came from Pesach Avrohm.  \r\nMy father's uncle Avrohom Schoenfeld was a Rav in Aiud (Rumanian \r\npronunciation) or Enyet (Hungarian pronunciation).

And that \r\nthe rand family moved into Munkacz around the start of World War I.\r\n \r\nIn 1920 Yaakov Tzvi Rand was arrested in Munkacz and held for about two weeks, \r\nbecause of some WW I evasion of draft service. He was according to tati turned \r\nin by a Jewish informer, and eventually freed by a judge, thanks to help from \r\na SPielman girl. This should be in the Munkaczer court house records. According \r\nto tati the courthouse was at the end of Louis Kossuth street, where he had \r\nlived.
