So we're in Z rather than N.\n\nGuy observes that it may be that  N &gt; m;  and quotes instance  N=23  for m=18.\n\nSo presumably this means  18/23 CANNOT be expressed as the sum/diff of 3 unit\nfractions.  And is (presumably) the \"first\" counterexample.\n\nQuery:  Is there any reason for 18/23.  I guess not; it just seems to be a\n        random-looking phenomenon.  No doubt there are many others in this\n        much-conjectured but imperfectly known field; I bet the law of\n        small numbers has great sway in Egyptian fractions!\n\nQuery:  What are the next few that cannot be so expressed.  Can some of those\n        newsgroupies who've announced the possession of fast software for\n        unit fractions, post a list of examples of other failures; up to\n        some convenient denominator size.\n\nThat is,  fractions  m/n  with  m&lt;n, that cannot be written  1/x +- 1/y +- 1/z.\n\nThanks!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n             Bill Taylor            <a href= \n\"mailto:W.Taylor@math.canterbury.ac.nz\">W.Taylor@math.canterbury.ac.nz</a>\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   This stupid computer never does what I want it to, only what I tell it to!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
