NE43-518\n  545 Technology Square\n  Cambridge, MA 02139\nCost: None, but come prepared to discuss technical issues\n\nPurpose:\n1) To review and refine documents describing scenarios of use of\ndistributed authoring and versioning on the WWW.\n2) To review and provide feedback on requirements for distributed authoring\nand versioning.\n3) To discuss and develop proposed modifications to the HTTP protocol\n(and/or other WWW technologies) to satisfy the requirements.\n4) To develop work assignments and schedules for revising scenarios and\nrequirements documents, and for creating or revising draft proposals for\ntechnical solutions.\n5) Discussion of which functionality should be campaigned for in HTTP 1.2,\nand which should be pushed off into a standard (PEP?) extension\n6) Reviewing the action items from the San Mateo meeting.\n\nExpected inputs to this meeting:\n- draft scenarios documents for distributed authoring and versioning\n- requirements documents for distributed authoring and versioning which\nhave been submitted to the IETF as initial revisions of non-standards track\ninternet drafts, for eventual publication as informational RFCs\n- informal draft proposals for technical solutions to satisfy the requirements\n\nDesired outputs:\n- Suggestions for new scenarios, refinements to existing scenarios (and who\nwill edit them, and by when)\n- Refinement of requirements documents, and agreement that the requirements\nare complete (plus due dates for revised documents)\n- A more clear understanding of the solution space, assignments (with due\ndates) for developing proposed solutions for submission to the work groups.\n\nMy apologies for the short notice on this meeting.  The driving\nconsiderations were a) ensuring that the documents we produce are timely\nenough to have positive effect on the dialog concerning HTTP 1.2, b) having\na meeting on the East Coast to be equitable in geographic location, while I\nam still a Visiting Scholar at the W3C (I will remain until 9/20).  If it\nturns out the 16th is a really bad day, please let me know.  If I get\nsignificant negative feeback about this date, I will consider changing it.\n\nThe excellent W3C staff will be coordinating the meeting for me.  They ask\nthat if you are planning on attending, please register for the meeting by\nSept. 11, at <a href=\"mailto:register@w3.org\">register@w3.org</a>.\n\n-------------------\n\nSent to <a href=\"mailto:register@w3.org:\">register@w3.org:</a>\n\nREGISTRATION DUE DATE:  September  11, 1996\n\nInformal Technical Meeting on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning\n\nName:\nTitle:\nCompany:\nAddress:\nCity, State/Province, Zip/Postal Code:\nCountry:\nEmail:\nTelephone\nCo.
