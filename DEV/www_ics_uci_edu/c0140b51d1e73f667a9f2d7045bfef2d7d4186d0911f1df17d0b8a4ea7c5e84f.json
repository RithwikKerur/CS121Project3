This means\r  that people would identify their projects at the outset (e.g. NSF ITR project,\r  135 course, JPL project, etc.). Then as people create Word docs, Excel spreadsheets,\r  send/receive emails, write notepads for phone messages, etc. they would assign\r  these to their separate working spheres. Thus, each working sphere would contain\r  a set of information related to it. In this way, people would access their\rdata according to their working spheres.</p>\r<p>But wait--it gets more complicated. I don't think a simple traditional file\r  hierarchy is the way to go. I'd like to see similarity indexes used to relate\r  the documents within each working sphere in terms of &quot;closeness&quot;.\r  This &quot;closeness&quot; measure could be determined e.g. as the time that\r  the artifact was created, by specifying the key person (or people) involved\r  in it, by its importance, or even some other measure. This means in effect\r  that people could have different visualizations of their information dependiing\r  on what dimension they would like to use to view their information. i envision\r  the interface as a visualization of the information within a working sphere.</p>\r<p>The motivation for this system comes from real life data that shows that people\r  switch projects about every 12 minutes (and lower order events about every\r  3 minutes). The goal is that this system can help people maintain continuity\rin their working spheres.</p>\r<p><a href=\"#index\">Back to Index</a> </p>\r<P>\r<HR WIDTH=\"100%\">\r<h4><a name=\"Palantir1\"></a>Integrating Palant&iacute;r with Subversion and Eclipse</h4>\r<UL>\r  <LI>offered by the Software Engineering Group of the ICS Department at UC Irvine\r  <LI>Customer Contacts: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Eandre/\">Prof. Andre\r      van der Hoe</a>k  and\r  Anita Sarma \r</UL>\r<p>Palant&iacute;r is a workspace awareness tool that informs developers about\r  the ongoing activities of other developers.

It<br>\r  is similar to code-based environments like Eclipse or Visual Studio in<br>\r  that it integrates many software engineering tools in a single, unified<br>\r  environment, but instead of focusing on the code as the primary<br>\r  development artifact, it focuses on an architectural model, specified<br>\r  in an XML-based language called xADL 2.0.</p>\r<p>xlinkit is an off-the-shelf constraint analyzer for XML documents. It<br>\r  allows users to specify complex constraints among XML elements using<br>\r  a (relatively) simple constraint language, and then quickly checks XML<br>\r  documents to see if those constraints are met or not. If they are not<br>\r  met, then violations of those constraints are reported.</p>\r<p>The goal for this project is to integrate xlinkit into ArchStudio 3<br>\r  to allow ArchStudio developers to rapidly create analysis tools for<br>\r  xADL 2.0 architectural descriptions. In its current form, xADL 2.0<br>\r  has many implied constraints among elements that are too complex to<br>\r  be checked by a regular XML syntax validator; however xlinkit should<br>\r  be able to check many/most of these constraints. Ideally, the output<br>\r  of this project would be a framework in which developers could write<br>\r  a constraint in the constraint language of xlinkit, and then have<br>\r  xlinkit check an open xADL 2.0 architecture for these constraints<br>\r  and report violations in a user-friendly way.</p>\r<p>The challenges for this project include obtaining a copy of xlinkit<br>\r  for development (it's currently under commercial license but the <br>\r  original developers are friends of the software group here, and <br>\r  it should be possible to get a developer's license or use an older,<br>\r  open-source release), integrating xlinkit into the ArchStudio 3<br>\r  environment as a component (or set of components, or meta-component), <br>\r  writing constraints to check xADL 2.0 documents, and translating<br>\r  the results of the constraint check into data that is in the<br>\r  format used by ArchStudio 3.</p>\r<p>This project is worth doing because it has the potential to improve<br>\r  the constraint analysis capabilities for software architecture models<br>\r  significantly. I believe that a properly done xlinkit-ArchStudio<br>\r  integration will make writing analysis tools for xADL 2.0 descriptions<br>\r  a full order of magnitude simpler than it is now, and likely more<br>\r  efficient as well. In the longer-term, I believe the xlinkit-ArchStudio<br>\r  integration will be critical to managing relationships among different<br>\r  views in a multi-viewed software architecture model.</p>\r<p>&gt; Features: (a short bullet list of one-line descriptions of features or<br>\r&gt; requirements)</p>\r<p> - xlinkit integrated into ArchStudio 3 as a component (or set of<br>\r  components, or meta-component)<br>\r  - Such that errors found when checking xADL 2.0 documents are<br>\r  displayed to the user in a friendly way<br>\r  - Such that errors found when checking xADL 2.0 documents are<br>\r  related back to individual elements in the document in a<br>\r  format that other ArchStudio 3 tools (e.g. editors like<br>\r  ArchEdit and Archipelago) can understand so they can help<br>\r  the user focus on and fix the errors.<br>\r  - A set of example constraint analyzers for the current version <br>\r  of xADL 2.0.<br>\r  - Includes some part/tool/well-defined-method that allows <br>\r  developers to easily create future xlinkit constraints for <br>\r  future xADL 2.0 features<br>\r  - Double Bonus: Obtaining/using an xlinkit license that allows <br>\r  us to redistribute the results of this work as a part of <br>\r  the ArchStudio 3 toolset.</p>\r<p><a href=\"#index\">Back to Index</a> </p>\r<HR WIDTH=\"100%\">\r<h4><a name=\"Dashofy2\"></a>xArchScript: Scripting for xADL 2.0 documents in ArchStudio 3.</h4>\r<UL>\r  <LI>offered by the Software Engineering Group of the ICS Department at UC Irvine\r  <LI>Customer Contact: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Eedashofy/\">Eric Dashofy</a></UL>\r<p>ArchStudio 3 is a research environment for software architectures.

To augment this API, we<br>\r  would like to integrate a scripting framework into ArchStudio that<br>\r  allows users to write and execute scripts that can perform maintenance <br>\r  tasks on xADL 2.0 documents. For example:</p>\r<p> - Find all elements in the document that do not have an ID (but<br>\r  should), and generate a random, unique ID for each one.<br>\r  - Replace all links in the architecture with two links and<br>\r  an instrumenting connector.<br>\r  - Create a component type for each component in an architecture<br>\r  that doesn't have one, based on the information in the component's<br>\r  description.</p>\r<p>Because xADL 2.0 is a complex (and extensible) language, the scripting <br>\r  language should support simple functions, recursion, variables, string<br>\r  maniuplation and all the other trappings of a 'real' scripting language.<br>\r  As such, we recommend that an off-the-shelf scripting framework for Java<br>\r  be used--this should simplify your life greatly. Candidates include Jython<br>\r  (a Python implementation for Java) and Rhino (a Javascript implementation<br>\r  for Java). The outcome of this project should include at least one<br>\r  ArchStudio 3 component accessible via API that can execute scripts; bonus<br>\r  for including a separate script editor/debugger component.</p>\r<p>This project is challenging because it involves integrating an <br>\r  off-the-shelf software tool (a scripting engine) with an existing<br>\r  environment. It will probably also entail the use of Java reflection<br>\r  to provide a full suite of capabilities.

Nideffer\r</UL>\r<p>unexceptional.net is a multimodal, pervasive, location-aware 'net-centric'<br>\r  game.</p>\r<p>The game is quest-based, and revolves around a central character - Guy.<br>\r  Guy is a frustrated comic artist, game designer, hacker who's recently<br>\r  found out that his long-time partner is having an affair. This discovery<br>\r  launches him upon a series of quests, that you participate in, in effort<br>\r  to gain insight into the nature of his partner's relationship. In the<br>\r  process, due to his cheating partner's interests and influence, his<br>\r  experience is infused with an eastern philosophy and spirituality that<br>\r  dictates the nature of the quests, and the ultimate goal, Guy's search for<br>\r&quot;enlightenmnet.&quot;<br>\r</p>\r<p>PHASE I: Background</p>\r<p>Phase I (begun in Redmiles' 125 class, and continued over the Summer)<br>\r  involved design and implementation of a server infrasturcture for storing<br>\r  and delivering game-sttte via both GPS enabled cell phone, and the Web.</p>\r<p>On the Web side, a Blog (administered by the game's central character,<br>\r  Guy) is used as a vehicle for providing the player information about<br>\r  current game state, player locations, and quest progress. The Blog is also<br>\r  used as an administrative framework enabling the game designers to<br>\r  dynamically and flexibly customize the game and have it immediately<br>\r  reflected in the various interfaces - at this point Web and GPS cellphone.<br>\r  I refer to this as the 'World-Building Toolkit' component. The<br>\r  world-building is done through a series of user-friendly Web pages<br>\r  allowing customization of a wide-range of game-state data such as<br>\r  inventory, statistics, the main character, npc characters, and a number of<br>\r  location related services allowing specification of how things like<br>\r  region, terrain, and structure will be defined and treated during<br>\r  gameplay. All of this work was done using PHP, MySQL, HTML, DHTML, and<br>\r  Javascripting.</p>\r<p>On the phone side we used Nextel's Motorola i730 GPS cellphones for<br>\r  prototyping. The phone client is written in J2ME using the MIDP 2.0<br>\r  specification. We also wrote a servlet that handles direct socket<br>\r  connections to the game server, and does the authentication and data<br>\r  uploading and downloading. The phone game is a 2D isometric style game<br>\r  where the main character Guy runs around the world on a series of<br>\r  location-based quests madly looking for his cheating partner and her<br>\r  lover. On startup of the phone game a number of things happen: 1)<br>\r  authentication; 2) notification and storage of the player's lat/lon<br>\r  location to the server; 3) pulling down the player's active quest<br>\r  information from the server to the phone; and 4) pulling down all relevant<br>\r  inventory, statistics, region, terrain, and structure data from the server<br>\r  to the phone. The phone has two modes of representing the player; 1) the<br>\r  'astral body' which is associated with the character representation that<br>\r  is controlled via key commands and can interface it with the gameworld<br>\r  (pick up items, bomb structures, interact with characters, etc); and 2)<br>\r  the 'physical body' which is controlled via the player's actual movement<br>\r  in physical space, updated via the GPS feed. As game play ensues,<br>\r  game-state is continually updated to the server. After quitting, when the<br>\r  player logs back in to the game via the Web interface, the impact of game<br>\r  play via the phone will be reflected in the Blog.</p>\r<p>All this brings us to what I would love to get students from your class<br>\r  involved with as...</p>\r<p>PHASE II: Next Steps</p>\r<p>One of the core R&amp;D projects in the Game Culture and Technology Lab is\r  a<br>\r  'Game-Grid' infrastructure we have implemented in relationship with our<br>\r  partners, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, Sun Microsystems, and a<br>\r  third-party technology middleware provider, Butterfly.net. Among other<br>\r  things, the grid will enable massively multiuser game environments on a<br>\r  scale far greater than anything currently available. We have hooked<br>\r  several 3D game engines into the grid - Crystalspace, NDL and Torque. One<br>\r  of the goals is to enable a character that is instanciated in one<br>\r  environment to seamlessly move into a completely foreign environment<br>\r  running in another engine.</p>\r<p>This brings me back to unexceptional.net. Phase II prototyping will<br>\r  involve specifying and implementing a real-time 3D massively multiuser<br>\r  interface (MMOG) to Guy's world that runs on the grid. Torque will be used<br>\r  as the primary engine. The goal will be to make the MMOG function<br>\r  analagous to the phone. In other words, to build in at the infrastructure<br>\r  and content creation level a far greater degree of modularity and<br>\r  flexibility than is common. For instance, the Torque client will need to<br>\r  communicate with the game server database to access stats, inventory, and<br>\r  location information, as well as update that information to the database<br>\r  during gameplay.</p>\r<p>This team would be primarily responsible for helping to design and<br>\r  implement the Torque client in relation to what already exists on the Net<br>\r  and GPS phone side. Useful skills would include familiarity with 3D games<br>\r  and game engines, graphics programming, SQL database programming, PHP<br>\r  scripting, Torque's internal scripting language (similar to C++), and<br>\r  networking.</p>\r<p><a href=\"#index\">Back to Index</a> </p>\r<HR WIDTH=\"100%\">\r<h4><a name=\"filesharing\"></a>File-sharing - moving towards &quot;what you see is what you get&quot;</h4>\r<UL>\r  <LI>offered by the Software Engineering Group of the ICS Department at UC Irvine\r  <LI>Customer Contacts: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Esgirish/\">Girish\r  Suryanarayana</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ejerenkra/\">Justin Erenkrantz</a> \r</UL>\r<p>Description:<br>\r  File-sharing applications such as Napster, Gnutella, Limewire etc. were all\r  really cool, but they suffered from a very significant problem. There was no\r  way to ensure that the resources (such as files) you were downloading were\r  actually the resources you thought you were downloading. Moreover, you could\r  in fact have downloaded viruses and spyware that could have harmed your computer.\r  What if there could be a way to ensure &quot;what you see is what you get!!&quot;<br>\r  <br>\r  XREP is one solution to this problem. It uses a reputation-based approach that\r  helps peers choose reliable resources in decentralized P2P applications. In\r  addition, the PACE architectural style provides guidance on how and where to\r  integrate trust and reputation models in the application architecture. PACE,\r  combined with XREP, can provide a promising approach to tackle the problem\r  of choosing reliable resources in file-sharing applications. PACE implementations\r  for other domains, such as auction and collaboration, have already demonstrated\r  its feasibility.<br>\r  <br>\r  The goal of the project will be to incorporate the XREP approach into PACE\r  for the document-sharing domain. In particular, each peer will be built using\r  the PACE architectural style and will utilize the XREP reputation model to\r  determine the trustworthiness and reliability of a resource and the provider\r  before it is actually downloaded.<br>\r  <br>\r  This project offers several benefits:<br>\r  1.

Computers have mostly only been used to write music\r  using a computer so that a finished musical score can be printed out looking\r  the same way scores looked 150 years ago. No attempt has been made to use computers\r  to change the appearance and hence the method of communicating the composer&rsquo;s\r  intent to the performer. The page of music displayed on the computer screen\r  looks identical to the same page of music composed 150 years ago. To someone\r  not schooled and trained in music theory as a musician the notations written\r  on the page are very abstract; they are not intuitive; are incomprehensible\r  to a non-musician and are literally medieval.</p>\r<p>The purpose of this project is to revolutionize the way a musical score is\r  communicated to the performer in an intuitive manner so that he or she will\r  have a much faster learning curve on a new piece of music at the same time\r  being able to significantly improve the quality of the performance.</p>\r<p>Project Description</p>\r<p>The project will produce a simplified feasibility demonstration of the computer-based\r  scoring and display system. The demonstration system will simulate what the\r  ultimate operational system will look like and how it will perform to convey\r  the musical information to the performer(s). One or more choral pieces for\r  at least 4 voices (Soprano, Alto, Tenor and Bass) will be displayed and &ldquo;played&rdquo; in\r  real time with each voice on a separate LCD notebook display.<br>\r  Time permitting, additional features will be added that will include the following:<br>\r  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer will provide each voice with\r  a quiet pitch tone to the respective singer&rsquo;s ear one beat or one bar\r  before the singer voices the note so that they will get the right pitch.<br>\r  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer will play a louder note in real-time\r  in synchronization with the part the signer is performing.<br>\r  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A throat microphone on the singer&rsquo;s\r  neck will allow the singer to phonate the tone (almost silently with mouth\r  closed) before coming in and during the singing so that a real-time &ldquo;pitch\r  meter&rdquo; on the screen can display an indication to the singer whether\r  they are under or over pitched.<br>\r  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of musical notes, as used in conventional\r  scores, the notes will be displayed as lines that scroll across the screen\r  much like an old fashioned scroll in a player piano. Each note to be sung will\r  be on a horizontal line corresponding to one note on a piano keyboard (white\r  or black.)<br>\r  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The moving lines that represent the notes\r  will vary in width according to the loudness with which they are to be sung.<br>\r  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tonal quality, whether bright or mellow,\r  will be designated by whether the line has a fuzzy or a smooth edge. (Change\r  of color of the line, e.g. red to blue could alternatively be used.)<br>\r  7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The words of the choral piece will accompany\r  the moving lines as they scroll across the screen.<br>\r  8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exact timing of the entry and exit of\r  a note is designated by when the horizontally scrolling note line hit a stationary\r  vertical time marker on the screen.<br>\r  9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The consonants in the words, which are important\r  to making a sung word intelligible to the listener, will be designated in the\r  score line by a narrow broadening of the line at the appropriate timing.<br>\r  10.&nbsp; A real-time TV image of the musical director (conductor) will appear\r  as a desktop image behind the musical display so the singer&rsquo;s eyes are\r  constantly seeing the conductor while reading the computer score.</p>\r<p>Constraints</p>\r<p>Must use standard off-the-shelf hardware consisting of a PC server connecting\r  to a number (at least 4) LCD displays or notebooks with displays that can be\r  exactly synchronized with server.</p>\r<p>Notes</p>\r<p>Contact the customer for additional information</p>\r<p>Alex Metherell<br>\r  E-mail: Alex.Metherell@cox.net</p>\r<p><a href=\"#index\">Back to Index</a> </p>\r<HR WIDTH=\"100%\">\r<h4><a name=\"blah\"></a>Blah Blah Blah: A Content Creation Infrastructure In Support Of Speech-Based\rLocation-Aware Mobile Phone Gaming</h4>\r<p>Clients:<br>\r  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Ewmt\">Bill Tomlinson</a>, Assistant Professor of Informatics and Drama<br>\r  Robert Nideffer, Associate Professor of Studio Art and Informatics</p>\r<p>In recent years mobile phones have become common in the US, and games for\r  these phones have flourished. Currently, mobile gaming is focused almost exclusively\r  around using the phone as a miniature computer, where buttons provide the primary\r  input mechanism and a tiny screen displays the output. This paradigm is at\r  odds with the core functionality of the telephone &ndash; voice input and output.\r  We are convinced that there could be a whole new generation of games better\r  utilizing voice technology.</p>\r<p>The project involves prototyping an interactive adventure game using a voice-driven\r  interface on location-aware mobile phones. The ICS 125 team would work to design\r  back-end support for connecting a GPS-enabled mobile phone to both a speech\r  recognition system (e.g., Sphinx, http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/) and a\r  text-to-speech system (e.g., FreeTTS, http://freetts.sourceforge.net/). The\r  processing between these two systems would be based on the GPS data from the\r  phone.</p>\r<p>A simple interaction might take the following form. A person calls a certain\r  phone number to begin the game. She then walks around campus. When she passes\r  a certain set of GPS coordinates (for example, the front of the Science Library),\r  her phone says 'You see a large book with an Anteater on the cover.' She replies,\r  'Get book.' The phone then tells her, 'You pick up the book.' She then says\r  'Inventory,' and the phone responds 'You have a large book with an Anteater\r  on the cover.'</p>\r<p>While this interaction is very simple, a system that can perform in this way\r  will allow for the creation of much more complex mobile games and other interactive\r  experiences. Ideally the project will be designed to allow ease of content\r  creation so additional game modules can be relatively quickly built and deployed.</p>\r<p>Features:<br>\r  Speech recognition<br>\r  Speech synthesis<br>\r  GPS data transfer from phone to base station<br>\r  Database of locations/objects and game state tracking<br>\r  System to generate the content that will be synthesized into speech</p>\r<p><a href=\"#index\">Back to Index</a> </p>\r<HR WIDTH=\"100%\">\r<h4><a name=\"3d\"></a>New True 3-D Digital Display System</h4>\r<UL>\r  <LI>offered by the Institute for Software Research at UC Irvine\r  <LI>Customer Contact: Dr. Alex F.

The lenticular screen is made up of tiny cylindrical\r  lenses positioned vertically side-by-side with a pitch equal to one lens every\r  2 pixels (or multiples thereof) horizontally such that the left eye will see\r  only the even numbered pixels while the right eye sees only the odd numbered\r  pixels (or visa versa.) The cylindrical lenses of the lenticular screen spreads\r  the pixels out so that a complete but different image is seen by each eye.&nbsp; When\r  the person is positioned at the right distance from the screen and positioned\r  correctly in a horizontal position a full stereo pair of images will be viewed\r  with full depth perception.</p>\r<p>The purpose of this project is to develop the software that controls the video\r  display card of the display that will take the input of a stereo-pair of images\r  and interdigitate them so that one of the images is on the horizontally odd-numbered\r  pixels and the other image is on the even-numbered pixels.</p>\r<p>Constraints: Must use standard off-the-shelf hardware consisting of a PC\r  with an LCD or plasma display.</p>\r<p>Notes: Contact the customer for additional information</p>\r<p>Alex Metherell<br>\r  E-mail: <a href=\"mailto:alexm@ics.uci.edu\">alexm@ics.uci.edu</a>\r</p>\r<p><a href=\"#index\">Back to Index</a> </p>\r<P>\r<hr>\r\r<h4><a name=\"genome\"></a>Jave-based Genome Browser for Mitochondrial DNA.</h4>\r<UL>\r  <LI>offered by the Institute for Genomics and Bioinformatics at UC Irvine\r  <LI>Customer Contact: Professors Pierre Baldi and  Wallace \r</UL>\r<p>MItochondria are semi-autonomous organelles existing within each one of our\r  cells which are involved in energy production (the &quot;power plants&quot; of\r  the cell).
