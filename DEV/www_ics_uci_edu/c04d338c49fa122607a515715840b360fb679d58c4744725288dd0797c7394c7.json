It is still possible, though I hope\nit is not the case, that some bugs remain lurking.\n<P>\nOne sure way to discern the existance of an error is to\nrun two different evaluators on the same problem and\nobtain two different answers.  In that case, it is certain\nthat one of the evaluators has given a wrong answer.\nOf course, it may not be a simple matter to determine\nwhich one was wrong!\n<P>\nTo help address this vexing problem, I suggest the establishment\nof a library of problems and answers, which can be used to\nhelp certify bridge hand evaluators as being possibly more reliable.\n<P>\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\nDan Hirschberg<BR>\nComputer Science Department<BR>\nUniversity of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3425<BR>\n</ADDRESS>\n<tt>dan at ics.uci.edu</tt><br>\nLast modified: July 1, 1996\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
