Asymptotically, the number of each\ntype of fixed lattice animal increases exponentially by some constant\nfactor, known as its growth constant, as the size of the lattice animal\nincreases. The exact values of these growth constants are not known, so\nwe will discuss some methods of proving lower bounds on their\nvalues. Specifically we will discuss an improvement to the traditional\n'concatenation argument' in which we show that appending lattice animals\ntogether can be used to lower bound the number, and thus the growth\nconstant, of lattice animals. We will also show an improvement on the\nbest known lower bound for the growth constant of polyiamonds by using\nan old method developed by Rands and Welsh (1981) based on\nPsuedo-Renewal Sequences.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on joint work with Gill Barequet.)</p>\n\n</body></html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
