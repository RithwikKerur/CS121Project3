Jim Whitehead\npresented an overview and history of WWW Distributed Authoring and\nVersioning, including information on how to become involved in the\nwork of the DAV group, which was followed by a detailed presentation on the\ncurrent DAV functionality requirements.  There was a lively discussion\non the requirements, including such issues as lock administration, use\nof public key technology, access control models, the degree of\nintelligence of \"move\" functionality, and recommendations of related\nprotocols and systems to investigate (such as AFS, IMAP, and ACAP for\ntheir models of access control).  These issues will be discussed\nfurther on our mailing list.  At the end of the session, the attendees\nwere polled on whether they thought it would be worthwhile for the\nIETF to work on WWW Distributed Authoring and Versioning.\nOverwhelmingly, the attendees thought the IETF should pursue work in\nthis area (the vast majority were in favor, with 2-3 opposed, and a\nhandful of abstentions).\n\n</P>\n\n<P>\n<B>Mailing list:</B> <I>&lt;w3c-dist-auth@w3.org&gt;</I><BR>\n<B>Archive:</B> <I>http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Archives/Public/w3c-dist-auth/</I><BR>\n<B>Home page:</B> <I>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/authoring/</I>\n</P>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
