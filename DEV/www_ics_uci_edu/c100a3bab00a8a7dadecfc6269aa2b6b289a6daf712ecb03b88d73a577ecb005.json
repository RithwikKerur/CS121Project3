Notable advantages and disadvantages that web technology offers to this area of teaching are covered as well as the technical difficulties and security issues that arise when providing minors access to the web.\n<P>\n<HR>\n<h2>1. Introduction</h2>\n\nThe <A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/\">World-Wide Web</A> has yet to be fully embraced by educators at the high school and grade school levels. The problem  arising  from the fact  that only a small portion of public high schools and elementary schools have access to the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.03.html\">Internet</A>. Once more educators realize the potential of the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.03.html\">Internet</A> and the <A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/\">World-Wide Web</A> will there be an increased demand for the web's resources in classrooms.  When this happens those currently accessing the web for educational purposes can expect increased research and developement in  web technology that will cater  more specifically to their needs. Moreover, the World-Wide Web's recent explosion in growth has already made news headlines. This attention the web has gained will hopefully continue to climb. If so, the interest of providing web service to grade school and high school stude\nnts will likely increase as well.\n\n<P>\nThe driving force behind the use of the <A HREF=\"http://www.w3.org/\">World-Wide Web</A> as an instructional tool lies in the web's ability to provide a limitless amount of information through a multimedia interface.  A web page further reinforces its own value as a multimedia document by employing its own links to other documents via <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61/guide.02.html\">hypertext</A>.\n<P>\nIn the document, <A HREF=\"http://cuiwww.unige.ch/eao/www/WWW95/paper.html\">Advanced Educational Uses of the World-Wide Web</A>, <A HREF=\"http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/\"> Stephen Franklin</A> and <A HREF=\"http://cuiwww.unige.ch/eao/www/Bertrand.html\"> Bertrand Ibrahim</A>  discuss two methods the classroom teacher can employ while using the web as a teaching tool. The first method discussed is to use web technology and corresponding browser technology to create web documents that model normal subject oriented course material or implementing a \"closed corpus\" strategy. An example of this strategy includes web documents that implement \"fill-out forms\". These \"fill-out forms\" allow students to enter data into a web document at specified places, therefore eliminating the need for homework assignments to be placed on paper.  Students would submit their answers via the \"fill-out form\". The second way the web can be used is for specific information retrieval and reference or using an \"open corpus\" strategy. \n An example of this strategy would be assigning students to pick a certain subject area to explore on the web, having them browse the web's domain in that area, and submit their own web document about the subject area they were exploring. \n<P>\nThe examples given above provide excellent use of web technology and its ability to incorporate distance learning. Distance learning does not take place in a classroom or at a library.  Distance learning maintains the idea that one document can serve millions of people who never have to leave a computer terminal to gain that documents information.\n<P>\nA final important note to make is that web documents are online, meaning they can be continuously be updated, changed, and refined, unlike a textbook or any other static physical object. With these points in mind the web's value, as a dynamic and ever expanding resource, cannot be ignored by the remaining  majority of our educators.\n<P>\nThe remainder of this document includes:\n<P>\n<UL>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#Current\">Current Programs and Research on the web in education.</A>\n<P>\n<LI>Some of the <A HREF=\"#A&D\">Advantages and Disadvantages</A> discovered while implementing the web as a teaching tool.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"#Security\">Security Issues</A> brought up by allowing minors access to the web.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"#Tech\">Technical Issues</A> of using the web as an instructional tool.\n</UL>\n<HR>\n<A NAME=\"Current\"><h2>2. Current Programs and Research</h2></A>\nWhile browsing the web, you will realize that there is quite a bit of\ninformation - sometimes there is even more information then you can\nneed - on each subject. This continues to be the case when researching\neducational topics originating within the web.\n\n<P>\nResearch is being completed and documents on educational projects are being produced so that there are a number of  programs available for students and teachers.  There are many <A HREF=\"http://www.rpi.edu/Internet/Guides/decemj/icmc/applications-education.html\">educational applications</A> available on the web and with scientific and technological advances, educators may be able to provide updated methods of teaching.\n<P>\n Through completed projects there was the creation of many educational programs such as the:  \n<P>\n<UL>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://ics.soe.umich.edu/\">Dewey Web</A>. The Dewey Web not only serves information to students.  It also  provides students a chance to share their knowledge with students all over the world. \n<P>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org:90/resource.cntnts.html\">EdWeb's Table \nof Contents</A> includes things such as:\n<P>\n<OL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org:90/stories.intro.html\">Computers and Kids: Life on the Front Lines</A>\n<LI> The <A HREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org:90/swep.html\">SchoolWeb Exploration Project (SWEP)</A>. The future of the Word-Wide Web and k-12 educational use lies in projects similar to SWEP.  In fact, their goal is to expand the use of the World-Wide Web in primary and secondary education.  So far they have gotten their first SWEP site up and running at <A HREF=\"http://www.elk-grove.k12.il.us/schoolweb/highland\">Highland Middle School</A>. \n<LI> The <A HREF=\"http://k12.cnidr.org:90/wwwedu.html\">WWWEDU Home Page</A>. Another project whose goal is dedicated to the use of the World-Wide Web in education. Their target: educators, webmasters, and web providers.  \n</OL>\n<P>\n<LI>Where would a web page on web education be without providing a link to one of the most talked about educational issues in the world today?  Find out about the enivironment via  <A HREF=\"http://envirolink.org/\">EnviroWeb</A>.\n<P>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://www.il.columbia.edu/LT/resources.html#top\">ILTweb:  Live \nText K-12 Resources</A> This is an educational resource where both educators and students will find to be of good use.  It is a gateway to educational topics.\n<P>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://www.clark.net/pub/journalism/kid.html\">KID (Kids Internet Delight)</A> A gathered listing of pointers to sites that children might enjoy.\n<P>\n<LI> Since much of the information on the web is not useful and interesting to schoolchildren <A HREF=\"http://www.npac.syr.edu/textbook/schoolweb/fastindex.html\">Kids Web - A World-Wide Web Digital Library for Schoolkids</A> provide links that are understandable and interesting to primary and secondary students.\n<P>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/\">Web 66</A> is a project that introduces technology - the use the the World-Wide Web - into elementary and secondary schools.  Its goals are to help set up Internet servers, link WWW servers. and find appropriate resources on the WWW for the classroom.  \n<P>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/schools.html\">WWW Schools Registry</A> contains links to schools that have web pages in the United States and throughout the rest of the world.\n<P>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://tecfa.unige.ch/info-edu-comp.html\">WWW Virtual Library:  \nEducational Technology</A> contains  pointers to subjects of interest within educational technologies.           \n<P>\n</UL>\nThis is only a partial list of the resources and programs available through \nthe access of the World-Wide Web.  Other sources that will aide you in \nfinding information on educational links are:  \n<P>\n<OL>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://www.wentworth.com/cyber/education.html\">Education links from Wentworth</A> A listing to some of the \"hottest\" educational World-Wide Web sites.\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://www.netspace.org/eos/main_image.html\">Educational Online Sources</A>\n<LI> The <A HREF=\"http://www.einet.net/galaxy.html\">EINet Galaxy</A> \n<LI> The <A HREF=\"http://elib.cme.nist.gov/fasd/pubs/schlenoff94.html\">World Wide Web and Mosaic:  User's Guide</A> \n<LI>The Yahoo Guide on <A HREF=\"http://www.yahoo.com/Education\">Education</A>.\n</OL>\n<P>\nWith links to these types of educational resources, educators will be able to utilize updated methods of teaching. This is only true if a teacher has access to an <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.03.html\">Internet</A> server.\n<HR>\n<A NAME=\"A&D\"><h2>3. Advantages and Disadvantages</h2></A>\n\nThere are many advantages as well as disadvantages for everything, \neven in using the Web.  An important advantage in using the Web as a tool \nfor teaching is that:\n<P>\n\n         The World Wide Web is a useful browser.  It makes it possible for \n         the user to navigate the Net.  It also provides links from one \n         information source to another information source.  This is very\n         useful to both students and teachers because this gives them a \n         chance to explore exciting educational sites that are available. \n         This also gives them an opportunity to share their knowledge and \n         findings on various interest subjects with people around the \n         world.  Thus, it makes learning fun.  For example, if students in \n         California wanted to know about the weather or what kinds of\n         damages were created during the earthquake Japan had earlier this \n         year, they can find out by using the programs on the Web.  This\n         will give students valuable learning that is fun.  \n<P>\n \nThere are also disadvantages of using the Web.  For instance, it could be \nquite confusing because sometimes we are unable to proceed with our \nnavigation within the Web.  This is due to the problems with navigational \nlinks where there are missing links, errors within the link (because it \nmoved to a different server), or even because of design problems.  \nAnother problem would be that there is so much information available out \nthere that you just do not know which ones contain valuable information.  \nThis is known as <A HREF=\"http://www.primus.com/staff/paulp/useless.html\">Useless WWW Pages</A>. Similar to worthless web pages are pages that are literally listed as  <A HREF=\"http://turnpike.net/metro/mirsky/Worst.html\">Worst of the Web (TM)</A>. \n\n<P>\n    \"In an educational context World Wide Web clients such as \n     Mosaic are of limited value because they put learners into \n     the role of information absorbers...Despite the richness of \n     exhibits in terms of the amount of material presented and \n     the use of multimedia, activity is resricted to navigation \n     through a real (museum) or hyper (Mosaic) spaces.\"\n\n<P>\nAlthough there are many problems in using the World Wide Web, it is still \nconsidered as a useful tool in education because with the ever increasing \ndemand in science and technology there will be changes and modifications \nto these programs.  Pretty soon there will be newer programs and ways of \nobtaining educational resources.\n\n<HR>\n<A NAME=\"Security\"><h2>4. Security Issues</h2></A>\n\nThere are two main security issues that face educators and developers when using the\nweb in education. The first concern implies that young students who have access to the Internet may obtain pornographic and obscene material. The second security issue concerns web bandwidth.  Children, whether they realize it or not, may retrieve enormous amounts of data thousands of miles away without a second thought of what they are doing.\n<P>\nRetrieving documents that contain explicit pictures or words in them is relatively easy and only takes a fair amount of browsing to accomplish. Students who do gain the ability to browse the web can painlessly discover links that can take them to pages  similar to <A HREF=\"http://www.netaxs.com/people/beauty/netsex.html/\">The Complete Internet Sex Resource Guide.</A> (A web document that provides access to several adult oriented Internet sites.) The resourcefulness of one student can quickly lead to many students gaining the URL to such a document. Security measures must be initiated to insure that students do not gain access to such things or the internet's community  relations could suffer.\n<P>\nThere are two obvious security methods to use in  guarding students from adult-oriented material on the web.  One method is to continually monitor students  as they traverse the web. The second is the creation of web technology  that can be better protected against unwanted retrievals.\n<P>\nThere  is one tool already available in the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/guide.61.html/guide.07.html\">Mosaic</A> browser called <A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/help-on-version-2.5b.html\"><I>kiosk mode</I>.</A> <I>Kiosk</I> mode removes the menubar and all control bar options except <I>back, forward, home</I> and <I>close</I>. Which limits some of the functionality of a particular document  but the hypertext links will still be available.  So use of the <I>kiosk</I> mode is limited at best.\n<P>\nAt the December 1994 <A HREF=\"http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/home.html\">Internet Engineering Task Force</A> meeting <A HREF=\"http://www-ns.rutgers.edu/www-security/https-wg.html\">The IETF HTTP Security Working Group</A> was put into action to develop requirements and specifications for security services for the web's protocol, HTTP. Working groups for WWW/HTTP security are just getting into action as indicated by the <A HREF=\"http://www-ns.rutgers.edu/www-security/index.html\">Rutgers WWW-Security Index</A > home page.\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<A NAME=\"Tech\"><h2>5. Technical Difficulties</h2></A>\nThe main technical difficulties that plague the k-12 educational community are:\n<UL>\n<LI> The ability of the web to deliver high-quality education at great distances over a shorter amount of time. (Children will quickly become irritated during a slow connection.)\n<P>\n<LI> The development of  programs that will allow  teachers to effieciently produce quality material for their students use on the World-Wide Web.\n</UL>\n<P>\nSince client programs request services from servers the first technological difficulty lies within web servers. The most crucial part of the server-client relationship is latency. Latency has several factors, including the client program's ability of displaying retrieved data and a server's hardware slowness, however the major problem is the web network's own latency. Latency due to propagation delays. These delays stem from the fact that the Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) makes too many unnecessary round trips when gathering information for a client. Improvements in latency overhead will undoubtably improve the speed at which documets on the web can be accessed and therefore displayed. A notable effort in <A HREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/IT94/Proceedings/DDay/mogul/HTTPLatency.html\">Improving HTTP Latency</A> was turned in by Venkata N. Padmanabhan (University of California-Berkeley) and Jeffrey C. Mogul (Digital Equipment Corporation Western Research Laboratory), their idea to improve latency by \nmaking simple changes to the HTTP protocol and its implementations resulted in significantly improved response times.\n<P>\nThe second technological difficulty is provding  programs to help teachers  develop educational material for their students.  An excellent example of a walkthru guide on how a teacher could set up the World-Wide Web for his/her classroom is the <A HREF=\"http://web66.coled.umn.edu/Cookbook/contents.html\">Web66 Internet Server Kitchen</A>. web pages such as this one and improvements in the technology of \"fill-out forms\" as mentioned in <A HREF=\"http://cuiwww.unige.ch/eao/www/WWW95/paper.html\">Advanced Educational Uses of the World_Wide Web</A> are just the beginnig of the offerings that the web will soon be producing for primary and\nsecondary educators.\n<HR>\n<body>\n</html>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
