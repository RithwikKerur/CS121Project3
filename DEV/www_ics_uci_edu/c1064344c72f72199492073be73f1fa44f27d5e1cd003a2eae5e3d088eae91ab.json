Richardson, Stephanie Lief Aha and T. Owen O'Malley in\n<i>Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Conference on\nSoftware Engineering,</i>\npages 105-118, Melbourne, Australia, May 1992.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nThe testing process is typically systematic in test data selection and \ntest execution. For the most part, however, the effective use of \ntest oracles has been neglected, even though they are a critical \ncomponent of the testing process. Test oracles prescribe acceptable \nbehavior for test execution. In the absence of judging test results \nwith oracles, testing does not achieve its goal of revealing failures \nor assuring correct behavior in a practical manner; manual result checking is\nneither reliable nor cost-effective. We argue that test oracles should be \nderived from specifications and in conjunction with testing criteria, \nrepresented in a common form, and their use made integral to the testing \nprocess. For complex, reactive systems, oracles must reflect the \nmultiparadigm nature of the required behavior. Such systems are often \nspecified using multiple languages, each selected for its utility in \nspecifying a particular computational paradigm. Thus, we are developing \nan approach for deriving and using oracles based on multiparadigm and\nmultilingual specifications to enable the verification of test results \nfor reactive systems as well as less complex systems. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:42:12 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
