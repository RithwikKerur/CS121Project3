If there are $n$ men and $n$ women, how many women (as a function of $n$) can be forced to settle for their last choice? Describe a scenario that would cause this many women to be matched with last-choice men: what preference orderings cause this behavior, and what does the algorithm do when given this input?</p></li>\n<li><p>Let $N$ be an even number, and form an undirected graph with $n$ vertices numbered from $0$ to $n\u22121$ by adding edges connecting each vertex numbered $i$ to the three vertices numbered $i\u22121$, $i+1$, and $i+n/2\\pmod{n}$. For instance, when $n$ is four, this graph can be drawn using the sides and diagonals of a square. For which values of $n$ is this graph bipartite? Explain how to find a $2$-coloring of the graph for the values of $n$ that make this graph bipartite, and how to find an odd-length cycle for the values of $n$ that make this graph non-bipartite.</p></li>\n<li><p>Recall that the Hopcroft&ndash;Karp algorithm finds a maximum matching in a bipartite graph by finding a sequence of alternating paths, where each path is chosen to be as short as possible. For instance, whenever it can, it will find a one-edge path connecting two unmatched vertices. For the graph of the cube (8 vertices and 12 edges) find a sequence of paths that this algorithm could find, such that at least one of your paths has more than one edge.</p></li>\n<li><p>(163 students:) Draw a 10-sided polygon (with axis-parallel sides and no holes) that can be partitioned into three rectangles in at least three different ways.</p>\n<p>(265 students:) Suppose that you are given an $n$-sided polygon with axis-parallel sides, to be partitioned into a minimum number $r$ of rectangles. Your polygon may have holes but the sides of the holes count towards $n$.\nWhat is the smallest value (best case) that $r$ might be, as a function of $n$? What is the largest value (worst case) that $r$ might be, as a function of $n$?</p></li>\n</ol>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
