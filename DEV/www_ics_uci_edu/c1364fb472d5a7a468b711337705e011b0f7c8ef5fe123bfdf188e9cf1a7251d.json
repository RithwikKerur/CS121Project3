How much messiness should we accept? What balance\nof new activities and familiar favorites is most fulfilling? \nAlthough these are clearly questions \nthat humans face, they are strongly related to\nconstraints faced by computers, \nand computer scientists have been grappling\nwith their version of such issues for decades. \nThe solutions they've found have much to teach us.\n</li>\n\n<li>\n<b> Course Overview.</b>\nThis seminar explores \nhow computer algorithms and algorithmic thinking can untangle some very human\nquestions. It will explore \nhow to have better hunches and when to leave\nthings to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices, and how best to\nconnect with others. From finding a job to finding a parking spot,\nfrom organizing one's inbox to understanding the workings of memory,\nthis seminar is directed at bringing\nthe wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living.\n</li>\n  <li> <b>Class meetings</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li> Lectures: Friday 11-11:50am in \n      <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/toolbox/roomfinder/class.php?ccode=87605&quarter=S17\">Donald Bren Hall 1425</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  <li> <b>Instructor</b>\n    <ul>\n      <li> Professor Michael Goodrich -- <tt>goodrich (at) uci.edu</tt><br>\n    </li></ul>\n\n<li> <b> Class Requirements </b>\n    <ul>\n      <li> Grades will be determined 50% from weekly quizes based on\n           the readings and 50% from\n           attendance and class participation.\n           Each student may miss one class meeting during the quarter\n           without penalty.\n    </li></ul>\n\n\n<li>\n<p><b>Laptop policy.</b>\nOpen laptop computers are not allowed during class meetings.\n<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away\">Here's why.</a>\n</li>\n\n<li><b>Text.</b> The course textbook is\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365/\">\nAlgorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions</a>, \nby Brian Christian  and Tom Griffiths.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Tentative Schedule</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><b>Week 1:</b> \n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_stopping\">Optimal stopping</a>: \nWhen to stop looking.
