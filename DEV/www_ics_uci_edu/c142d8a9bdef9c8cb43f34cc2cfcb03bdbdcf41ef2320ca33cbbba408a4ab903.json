Explain why or why not.\n(Hint: Try it with a few small numbers to see what happens.)</P>\n\n<PRE>\n    Read a number x.\n    Initialize a counter to zero.\n\n    While x is greater than zero, perform the following steps:\n\n        Increase the counter by one.\n        If x is odd, replace x by (x+1)/2;\n        otherwise (if x is even) replace x by x-2.\n\n    Once the loop terminates (if it does),\n    output the value of the counter and halt.\n</PRE>\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><I><FONT COLOR=\"RED\">\nAnswer:\nIf x=1, then (x+1)/2 is also 1, so the program\ngoes into an infinite loop.\n</FONT></I></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><LI>In the imaginary country of Binaria, the currency is based on the \ncentina, which is worth approximately the same as a penny.
