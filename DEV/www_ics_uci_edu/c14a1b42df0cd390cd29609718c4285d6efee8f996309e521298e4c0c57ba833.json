Each agent in the market prices their\nlabor, and based on these prices, consumers hire the cheapest available\nteam capable of doing the job they need done. We define the cheap labor\ncost in such a market as the ratio of the best Nash equilibrium of the\noriginal market and the best possible Nash equilibrium of any of its\nsubmarkets, where \"best\" is defined with respect to consumers, i.e., we\nare looking at Nash equilibria in which the consumer pays the\nleast. This definition is motivated by a <a\nhref=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess'_paradox\">\"Braess-style\"\nparadox</a>: in certain kinds of marketplaces, competition, in the form\nof the availability of \"cheap labor\", can actually cause the prices paid\nby consumers to go up.</p>\n\n<p>We present tight bounds on the cheap labor cost for a variety of markets\nincluding <i>s-t</i> path markets, matroid markets and perfect bipartite\nmatching markets. The differences in cheap labor cost across markets\ndemonstrate the complex relationship between the combinatorial structure\nof the marketplace and the advantages or more precisely, disadvantages\nto consumers due to competition.</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
