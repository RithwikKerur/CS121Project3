Project was to detect the human foreground image in each frame from camera input and place it properly in a 3d environment,\n        and let the user in the video interact with the 3d environment in real time.<br>\n        We provided a lamp in the virtual scene which the user could interact with, and change the lighting of the entire scene\n        including the user himself.\n        Also the 3d shadow of user's image was shown properly.<br><br>\n        In this project we used Unity3d game engine and the OpenCV library.<br><br>\n        <!--<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JWRGCc0EHCI\"
