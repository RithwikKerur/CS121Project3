The Web page should contain the information\nlisted below. <b>Send the URL (not the file) for the page to TAs as indicated above.</b>\nRemember to set protections for the &quot;world&quot; to browse your page.</p>\n\n<p><b>Team Name.</b> You may want to choose a name for your group to give yourselves some\nidentity. In the past, teams have given themselves nicknames based on the longer project\nname. Most Project names are short enough to serve as the team name, e.g., &quot;Java2D\nGEF.&quot; However, you have the option to invent a name.</p>\n\n<p><b>Team Logo.</b> Create some sort of logo or placeholder for your team.</p>\n\n<p><b>Project Name.</b> The &quot;official&quot; name of the project you want to bid on.\nThis name is taken from the projects Web page.</p>\n\n<p><b>Contact Person/Client.</b> The name and email of the client, as in project Web\npages.</p>\n\n<p><b>Summary.</b> You should write your own one or two paragraph (about 12 to 15\nsentence) summary of the project. This summary should be in your own words and it should\ncapture what you see to be salient features of the project. Therefore it is not simply the\nsummary from the project Web pages.</p>\n\n<p><b>Team Members.</b> You should include a list of the team members, with one member\nlisted as the &quot;lead.&quot; Each name should link to your individual Web page. If you\nare dividing responsibilities up in your group, you can choose to list responsibilities\nnext to the names (see e.g. the list of roles in the Mythical Man-Month). Of course, each\nteam member should assist with every activity in the project, but different members may\ntake the lead or the responsibility for different activities (e.g., testing, requirements,\netc.).</p>\n\n<p><b>Additional Links.</b> You may include an annotated list of links at the end of the\nWeb page. These will include at least a reference to the appropriate projects Web page. It\nmay include links relevant to types of technologies that you think you will use..</p>\n\n<hr ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\n\n<p><a HREF=\"assignments.html\">ICS125 WQ00 Assignments<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"../ics125.html\">ICS125 WQ00<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
