A clear talk comes from a clear short sequence of main ideas.\nTell a simple story.\n\n3.  Overview, preview, view, review.\n\n4.  Slides: Pictures, not text; brief phrases, not sentences.\nThe content delivery is you talking, not text on your slides.\n\n5.  Don't bog down in the Intro; it is later than you think.\nTime is always too short.\n\n6.  Relate your talk to AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM, even if indirect.\n\n7.  Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end:\nIntro, content, summary.\n\n8.  Tell only the most interesting details, and\ncontrol talk length by controlling detail depth.\nTo shorten or speed up a talk, say fewer details.\n\n9.  Make eye contact with someone in your audience,\nrelax, and speak directly to them; then make eye\ncontact with someone else, and repeat.\n\n10. Practice, practice, practice.\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
