The main goal is to understand how a general-purpose processor is designed and the influence of a software layer (instruction set and assembly language) and electronics on this design and its performance. The main concepts studied in the course are instruction set architecture, performance measures, advanced computer arithmetic, control unit design, memory hierarchy, pipelining, and parallel architectures.&nbsp;</P>\r\n<P>Some of these concepts have been introduced in other courses (CS 51 and CS 151) and will only be reviewed. This course puts a special emphasis on how the control unit is designed and implemented and the operation of a complete (although simple) processor. An instruction set architecture of MIPS processors is used throughout the course. The course also explains the main principles of a memory hierarchy design and the operation of caches and virtual memory. Finally, it is shown how performance can be greatly improved using pipelining and other forms of parallel execution.</P>\r\n</FONT><B><FONT FACE=\"Arial\" SIZE=4><P>Topics to be Covered (Tentative)</FONT> </P>\r\n\r\n<UL>\r\n</B><FONT FACE=\"Arial\"><LI>Concepts of Computer Performance and the Evaluation Metrics</FONT> </LI>\r\n<FONT FACE=\"Arial\"><LI>The Concept of Instruction Set Architecture</LI>\r\n<LI>MIPS ISA: Representing Instructions and Data in a Computer</LI>\r\n<LI>Computer Arithmetic and Datapath Design</LI>\r\n<LI>Control Unit implementation</LI>\r\n<LI>Fundamentals of Memory Hierarchy:</FONT> <FONT FACE=\"Arial\">Caches and Virtual Memory</LI>\r\n<LI>Pipelining and Pipeline hazards </LI>\r\n<LI>Parallel Architectures </LI></UL>\r\n\r\n</FONT>\r\n<B><FONT FACE=\"Arial\" SIZE=4><P>Course Requirements</P>\r\n</B></FONT><FONT FACE=\"Arial\"><P>The course is composed of three components: lectures, homework assignments and exams.
