The\n<a\nhref=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/patent/patent.overview.html\">patent\nattorney</a> has on call <a\nhref=\"http://town.hall.org/patent/patent.html\">the millions of issued\npatents</a>, with familiar trails to every point of his client's\ninterest.  The physician, puzzled by its patient's reactions, strikes\nthe trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs\nrapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the\nclassics for the pertinent anatomy and <a\nhref=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?histology\">histology</a>.  The\nchemist, struggling with the synthesis of an organic compound, has all\nthe chemical literature before him in his laboratory, with trails\nfollowing the analogies of compounds, and side trails to their physical\nand chemical behavior.\n\n<p>\n\nThe historian, with a vast chronological account of a people,\nparallels it with a skip trail which stops only at the salient items,\nand can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over\ncivilization at a particular epoch.  There is a new profession of\ntrail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing\nuseful trails through the enormous mass of the common record.  The\ninheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the\nworld's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which\nthey were erected.\n\n<p>\n\nThus science may implement the ways in which man produces, stores, and\nconsults the record of the race.  It might be striking to outline the\ninstrumentalities of the future more spectacularly, rather than to\nstick closely to the methods and elements now known and undergoing\nrapid development, as has been done here.  Technical difficulties of\nall sorts have been ignored, certainly, but also ignored are means as\nyet unknown which may come any day to accelerate technical progress as\nviolently as did the advent of the thermionic tube.  In order that the\npicture may not be too commonplace, by reason of sticking to\npresent-day patterns, it may be well to mention one such possibility,\nnot to prophesy but merely to suggest, for prophecy based on extension\nof the known has substance, while prophecy founded on the unknown is\nonly a doubly involved guess.\n\n<p>\n\nAll our steps in creating or absorbing material of the record proceed\nthrough one of the senses - the tactile when we touch keys, the oral\nwhen we speak or listen, the visual when we read.  Is it not possible\nthat some day the path may be established more directly?\n\n<p>\n\nWe know that when the eye sees, all the consequent information is\ntransmitted to the brain by means of electrical vibrations in the\nchannel of the optic nerve.  This is an exact analogy with the\nelectrical vibrations which occur in the cable of a television set:\nthey convey the picture from the photocells which see it to the radio\ntransmitter from which it is broadcast.  We know further that if we\ncan approach that cable with the proper instruments, we do not need to\ntouch it; we can pick up those vibrations by electrical induction and\nthus discover and reproduce the scene which is being transmitted, just\nas a telephone wire may be tapped for its message.\n\n<p>\n\nThe impulse which flow in the arm nerves of a typist convey to her\nfingers the translated information which reaches her eye or ear, in\norder that the fingers may be caused to strike the proper keys.  Might\nnot these currents be intercepted, either in the original form in\nwhich information is conveyed to the brain, or in the marvelously\nmetamorphosed form in which they then proceed to the hand?\n\n<p>\n\nBy bone conduction we already introduce sounds into the nerve channels\nof the deaf in order that they may hear.  Is it not possible that we\nmay learn to introduce them without the present cumbersomeness of\nfirst transforming electrical vibrations to mechanical ones, which the\nhuman mechanism promptly transforms back to the electrical form?  With\na couple of electrodes on the skull the encephalograph now produces\npen-and-ink traces which bear some relation to the electrical\nphenomena going on in the brain itself.  True, the record is\nunintelligible, except as it points out certain gross misfunctioning\nof the cerebral mechanism; but who would now place bounds on where\nsuch a thing may lead?\n\n<p>\n\nIn the outside world, all forms of intelligence, whether of sound or\nsight, have been reduced to the form of varying currents in an\nelectric circuit in order that they may be transmitted.  Inside the\nhuman frame exactly the same sort of process occurs.  Must we always\ntransform to mechanical movements in order to proceed from one\nelectrical phenomenon to another?  It is a suggestive thought, but it\nhardly warrants prediction without losing touch with reality and\nimmediateness.\n\n<p>\n\nPresumably man's spirit should be elevated if he can better review his\nshady past and analyze more completely and objectively his present\nproblems.  He has built a civilization so complex that he needs to\nmechanize his record more fully if he is to push his experiment to its\nlogical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by\novertaxing his limited memory.  His excursion may be more enjoyable if\nhe can reacquire the privilege of forgetting the manifold things he\ndoes not need to have immediately at hand, with some assurance that he\ncan find them again if they prove important.\n\n<p>\n\nThe applications of science have built man a well-supplied house, and\nare teaching him to live healthily therein.  They have enabled him to\nthrow masses of people against another with cruel weapons.  They may\nyet allow him truly to encompass the great record and to grow in the\nwisdom of race experience.  He may perish in conflict before he learns\nto wield that record for his true good.  Yet, in the application of\nscience to the needs and desires of man, it would seem to be a\nsingularly unfortunate stage at which to terminate the process, or to\nlose hope as to the outcome.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"section7.html\">Section 7</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
