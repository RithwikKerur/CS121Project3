Normally one puts\neach class definition in a separate file and the files for\na program/project into a single directory. *DO NOT* follow\nthe comment style given here. These are explanatory comments\nfor learning the language. Alternatively you can view these\nas bad comments, which are sometimes seen. We will provide\nexamples of good commenting style.\n\n\n<pre>\n     class Complex        //  end of line comment\n   {\n     private double x;   // private: not accessible outside of class\n     private double y;   // data member\n      \n     Complex(double x, double y)   // constructor\n       {\n         this.x = x;        // x is passed parameter\n         this.y = y;        // this.x is the x of the object\n                            // . accesses data members\n       } \n     Complex(double x)     // by Convention, class names begin with capital\n      {                   // Java is case sensitive\n         this(x,0);        // here \"this\" refers to constructor at this level\n       }\n     Complex()           // functions are distinguished by their parameters\n     {\n       this(0,0);\n     }\n\n     double getReal()     // accessor: get values of data members\n    {                     // by conventions methods, start with lower case letter\n       return x;\n    }\n     double getImaginary()\n    { \n       return y;\n    }\n    void setReal(double x)   // mutators: change values of fields\n    {\n      this.x = x;\n     }\n    void setImaginary(double y)\n    {\n      this.y = y;\n    }                    \n    Complex  mult(Complex c)          \n      {\n        Complex d = new Complex(); // new allocates storage and returns reference to it.\n         d.setReal( x*c.getReal() - y*c.getImaginary() );  \n                 // . accesses member functions\n         d.setImaginary( x*c.getImaginary() + y*c.getReal() );\n        return d;\n      }\n public String toString()  \n/*     String is class in Java, not array of characters.\n       toString() is useful for printing and debugging\n       This overrides Object.toString().

If a string object\n   is needed, say by println, and the object is not a string then\n  the method toString() will be called automatically.\n</ul>\n  \n\n<h3> Java Class Vector in java.util </h3>\n  <p> A vector holds objects and allows addition and deletion of objects.\n   You may think of it as an extensible array.\n  It has 3 constructors and  about 30 methods. Vectors contain\n   objects (references). If you need it, Vector probably has it.\n  <ul>\n  <li> Constructor: Vector()\n  <li> public final synchronized void addElement(Object o); \n  <li> public final synchronized void removeElement(Object o); \n  <li> public final boolean contains(Object e);\n  <li> public final synchronized Enumeration elements();\n </ul>\n\n <h4> Notes: </h4>\n  <ul>\n   <li> <strong> final  </strong> means that it can't be overridden. This\n     is a safety feature.\n   <li> <strong> Enumeration </strong> permits moving through items of\n    data-structure one at time, as in a for-loop.\n   <li> Enumeration is an interface that has only two methods, namely:\n        <ul>\n          <li> hasMoreElements()\n          <li> nextElement()\n        </ul>  \n   <li> <strong> synchronized </strong> provides the ability to control\n    who  updates the vector, for example to prevent multiple simultaneous\n    deletions from same  bank account.\n </ul>\n <h3> Address Book: Class Exercise </h3>\n    <p> What are the objects: book, address, name, last-name,...\n    <p> What are the behaviors: \n <h3> Static Classes and Static Methods </h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li> Java has no global functions or globals constants.\n    <li> Global functions are implemented as static member functions.\n    <li> Ex.  Math.random() is the function in the class Math which\n         generates a random number.\n    <li> Global constants are implemented as static  member objects. By\n   convention constants are in all caps.\n    <li> Ex.  Math.PI  stands for the constant 3.14....\n    <li> Notice that we did not create an instance of the class Math.\n        These constants and functions are attached to the class itself.\n  </ul>\n <h4> Example </h4>\n   Return to the Complex number class.  Suppose we want to\n   count the number of complex numbers our program  generated.\n   To do this  add a static data member \"count\" and modify our\n   constructors.  Static functions can only access static data\n   members. We also add a corresponding  print function.\n   \n\n<pre>\n  public  class Complex\n  {\n     private static int count = 0;    // int is associated with class\n   \n     private double x;   // x,y are associated with each instance of class\n     private double y;\n      \n     Complex(double x, double y)   \n       {\n         this.x = x;        \n         this.y = y;        \n         count++;\n       } \n\n     ...\n   \n    public static printCount()   \n    { \n      System.out.println(\"Number of Complex numbers used is \"+count);\n    }\n    // The output goes to the console. It would be called with\n    //  Complex.printCount();     \n</pre>\n   Notice that static functions are not passed a \"this\" parameter.\n\n\n<h3> Java Semantics </h3>\n <ul>\n   <li> Semantics are defined operationally or procedural, ie.\n    by what the compiler/interpreter does.\n   <li> Recall: Java program is collection of classes.\n   <li> One class must have the same name as the file. This is\n      the main or \"driver\" class. This class is a bit unusual as\n     is allows command-line interaction. However it is derived from\n     Object and has an implicit call to \"super()\";\n   <li> Before an object of a class is used, it must be constructed,\n     except for the \"driver\" class or classes without data members.\n   <li> When an object's lifetime is over, it is automatically\n   garbage-collected. This removes a major source of errors from\n   languages that require the programmer to free memory. Memory\n   leaks have been a major source of problems with code.\n   <li> The order of classes or methods in a class is unimportant.\n    The language processor will sort out the order, unlike in C or C++.\n    This removes an annoyance.\n   <li> If a class has static variables and/or static expressions,\n     these are initialize/executed at load-time as they need to be available\n     for the objects of the class.\n   <li> Order of loading classes determines order of execution of static\n   expression blocks.\n   <li> The \"main\" routine in the driver class of an\n     application will be the first one that is executed. The driver\n   class of an application must  contain a definition of\n   <br> <em> public static void main(String[] args) </em>\n   <li> Other classes may have \"main\" routines which is useful for debugging.\n   <li>  In applets, the \"driver\" class must extend an Applet. We will\n    discuss the interpretation of applets later.\n    \n </ul>\n<h3> Design Rules (from Eiffel school) </h3>\n  <ul>\n   <li> Eiffel is an  Object-Oriented language that\n   came after C++ but before Java. Eiffel\n   does not rest on C but stressed object-oriented design,\n   bottom-up implementation, inheritance, programming by\n   contract, and use of assertions for preconditions and postconditions.\n   The goal was high-quality software.\n  <li> Why isn't this a succesful language?\n  <li> Classes should have few data members and many simple functions.\n  <li> A class defines the behavior of an object.\n  <li> If you repeat code, your design is wrong.\n  <li> If your code is complicated, your design is probably wrong.\n  <li> Reuse classes by inheritance.\n  <li> Reuse classes by creating multiple object of the class.\n <li> Code and test each class separately. (not always possible)\n  <li> Push code up the inheritance hierarchy.\n  <li> Novice coders use \"grab and run\".\n  <li> Experienced coders use \"guess, check and iterate\".\n   <li> Redesign: learn from the process.\n </ul>\n<h3> Object-Oriented Design Review </h3>\n <ul> \n  <li> Classes are new, user defined types.\n  <li> Classes define objects and hide implementations.\n  <li> Dependencies define relationships among classes.\n  <li> Dependencies allow for reuse and variation.\n  <li> Static-type checking promotes integration correctness,\n       efficiency, and comprehensibility.\n   <li> Bottom-up design yields more reuse, but also more less\n       abstraction.\n   <li> Top-design yields more better organization but less reuses.\n   <li> Proper design entails mixing top-down design and \n    and bottom-up design to maximize information-hiding (Parnas).\n </ul>\n<h3> Class/Object Summary </h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li> An object is an instance of a class.\n    <li> Each object has data members, corresponding to what\n    objects knows, and data functions, corresponding to what\n    an object can do.\n    <li> Be sure you can distinguish class members and object members.\n    <li> Arrays and Strings are objects in Java.\n    <li> Checklist of methods: constructors, accessors, mutators.\n    <li> Java does not have destructors as it uses garbage collection,\n    which can be called(scheduled) explicitly. \n    <li> A class is a user-defined type.\n    <li> Objects help bridge the gap between the problem and\n        code by decomposing the process.\n    <li> Domain classes are derived from domain analysis. They\n     model the world.\n    <li> Code classes are built from the primitive types. These\n    increase the level of abstraction of the code.\n    <li> Beyond minimality, add useful operations.\n    <li> For each class, expect to define constructors, accessors, and mutators.\n    <li> Functions can return objects.\n  </ul>\n\n<h3> Primitive Types </h3>\n  <ul>\n   <li>  The primitive types in Java are: boolean, char, byte, short,\n  int, long, float and double.\n   <li> Primitive types are not objects.\n   <li> Wrappers convert primitive types to objects, e.g.\n        Integer(3) is a wrapper that constructs an Integer object\n       from the integer 3. This is useful as some generic functions\n      require objects. For example Vector() is a container of objects,\n     not of primitive types.\n  </ul>\n<h3> What you should be absolutely sure of </h3>\n  <ul>\n   <li> How to <b>define </b> and <b> access </b>\n     <ul>\n      <li> classes\n      <li> objects\n      <li> class or static methods\n     <li> object methods\n     <li> class or static variables\n     <li> object variables\n    </ul>\n  </ul>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
