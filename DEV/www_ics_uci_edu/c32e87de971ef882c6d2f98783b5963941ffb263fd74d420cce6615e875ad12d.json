We\nprovide data structures for these problems that use near- linear\npreprocessing time, linear space, and sublogarithmic query time to\nhandle queries that ask for the number of connected components, number\nof components that contain cycles, number of vertices whose degree\nequals or is at most some predetermined value, number of vertices that\ncan be reached from a starting set of vertices by time-increasing paths,\nand related queries.\n</p>\n<p>\n(Joint work with Christopher DuBois, David Eppstein, and Padhraic Smyth)\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
