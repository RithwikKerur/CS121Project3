We will append various bits of data to URLs and in so doing allow users to access versioned and distributed data.\r\n</UL><UL>\r\nHowever this effort is too important to include as just another section in our work. It deserves its own specification which should be handled separately from the HTTP effort. Let our current specs concentrate on HTTP while legacy support gets the attention it so richly deserves in a separate sub-group.</UL> </P> \r\n\r\n</Body>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
