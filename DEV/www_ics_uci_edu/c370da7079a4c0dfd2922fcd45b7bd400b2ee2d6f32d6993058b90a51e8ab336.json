Karger, E. Nikolova\n<BR>Speaker: Gwendoline Chien\n</h2>\nFrom:\nDIMACS Workshop on Computational Issues in Auction Design\n<P>\nThe authors addressed the problem of selecting the cheapest possible route\nbetween a source and a destination in a graph in which edges are owned by\nself agents.  The VCG mechanism is the unique efficient mechanism, however\nthe payments made by VCG can be unacceptably high in some graphs.  In\nthis paper, they study the VCG overpayment in different types of graphs\nwith unit and uniformly random edge costs.  The results suggests that for\ncommon real-world networks, the VCG payments will not e too much higher\nthan the true costs.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
