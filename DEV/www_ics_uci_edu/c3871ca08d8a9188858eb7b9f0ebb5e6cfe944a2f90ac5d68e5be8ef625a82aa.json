(He avoided using both the \"C\" word and the \"F\" word\nafter the introduction to the talk.  It was not about either chaos or\nfractals, but about what the M set is, mathematically.)  Anyway, he\ndiscussed two results which we've seen separately in this group in the\nlast month or so.  Namely, that by computing the area of the M-set\nusing lots of terms in a series (Laurent Series?), the upper bound of\nthe area seems to converge about at 1.72 (the graph gets quite flat,\nand seems to have an asymptote there), and by counting pixals more and\nmore accurately, you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1.52.\nBoth these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in\nthe limit - that is, it is NOT the case that these numbers would get\ncloser if a finer grid were used, or more terms were taken in the\nseries.  So, why the difference of 10% or so?  No one knows.  One\npossibility is that the pixal method misses \"hairs\" around the border.\n(I know thats not described very well; it was late, and I wasn't\ntaking notes.)  There was also a vague theory for the higher number\nbeing possibly wrong.  But basically, it is not known, at present,\nwhich of these numbers represents the \"real\" area (although it is\nbelieved that one of them does.)  I'm afraid he didn't give references\n(I asked afterwards.)\n\n  -- Stan Isaacs\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:jasonp@wam.umd.edu\">jasonp@wam.umd.edu</A> (Jason Stratos Papadopoulos)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: centroid of the Mandelbrot's set\n<B>Date:</B>           19 Jun 1996 15:52:41 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   University of Maryland College Park\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nZdislav V.

Gerald Edgar posted an area estimate based on\n72 terms.  Yuval Fisher pointed out that a 256-term estimate gives a\nmuch lower value, and he described how to compute coefficients in the area\nseries.\n\nUsing Yuval's suggestion, I computed over 100,000 terms of the series.\nThe estimate converges very slowly -- a summary appears below.  An\ninportant point is that every truncation of the series is an \n*upper bound* on the area of M.  Based on the trend I'd say the true \narea is probably less than 1.70, but I won't bet my firstborn on that.\n\n# terms: area estimate\n    72: area &lt; 2.09288\n   128: area &lt; 2.02781\n   180: area &lt; 2.01237\n   256: area &lt; 1.97752\n   360: area &lt; 1.94961\n   512: area &lt; 1.92751\n   720: area &lt; 1.91255\n  1024: area &lt; 1.89534\n  1440: area &lt; 1.87172\n  2048: area &lt; 1.85461\n  2880: area &lt; 1.84576\n  4096: area &lt; 1.83452\n  5760: area &lt; 1.81649\n  8192: area &lt; 1.80616\n 11520: area &lt; 1.79642\n 16384: area &lt; 1.78636\n 23040: area &lt; 1.7747\n 32768: area &lt; 1.76683\n 46080: area &lt; 1.75936\n 65536: area &lt; 1.75337\n 92160: area &lt; 1.74321\n115232: area &lt; 1.73847\n--\nScott Huddleston\n<A HREF=\"mailto:scott@crl.labs.tek.com\">scott@crl.labs.tek.com</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:isaacs@hpcc01.HP.COM\">isaacs@hpcc01.HP.COM</A> (Stan Isaacs)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     alt.fractals\n<B>Subject:</B>        More on the area of the Mandelbrot Set\n<B>Date:</B>           25 Feb 91 07:43:14 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   HP Corp Computing &amp; Services\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nAt the Northern California Section of the MAA meeting this past\nweekend, John Ewing gave an interesting talk called \"Can We See the\nMandlebrot Set\".  (He avoided using both the \"C\" word and the \"F\" word\nafter the introduction to the talk.  It was not about either chaos or\nfractals, but about what the M set is, mathematically.)  Anyway, he\ndiscussed two results which we've seen separately in this group in the\nlast month or so.  Namely, that by computing the area of the M-set\nusing lots of terms in a series (Laurent Series?), the upper bound of\nthe area seems to converge about at 1.72 (the graph gets quite flat,\nand seems to have an asymptote there), and by counting pixals more and\nmore accurately, you seem to get a lower bound of very close to 1.52.\nBoth these bounds are close to the values the methods would produce in\nthe limit - that is, it is NOT the case that these numbers would get\ncloser if a finer grid were used, or more terms were taken in the\nseries.  So, why the difference of 10% or so?  No one knows.  One\npossibility is that the pixal method misses \"hairs\" around the border.\n(I know thats not described very well; it was late, and I wasn't\ntaking notes.)  There was also a vague theory for the higher number\nbeing possibly wrong.  But basically, it is not known, at present,\nwhich of these numbers represents the \"real\" area (although it is\nbelieved that one of them does.)  I'm afraid he didn't give references\n(I asked afterwards.)\n\n  -- Stan Isaacs\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:shallit@graceland.waterloo.edu\">shallit@graceland.waterloo.edu</A> (Jeffrey Shallit)\n<B>Subject:</B>        area of the Mandelbrot set\n<B>Organization:</B>   University of Waterloo\n<B>Date:</B>           Tue, 10 Mar 1992 14:52:52 GMT\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nThere was some discussion a while back about the area of the\nMandelbrot set.

However, the estimates of the area from below,\nusing pixel counting show that the area is at least 1.52.  The large\ngap between the lower bound 1.52 and the upper bound 1.71 may possibly\nbe an indication that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has\npositive area...\n\nThe Ewing and Schober paper cited also explains the computation of\nthe coefficients b_m in the series.\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 18 Sep 92 10:31:51 EST\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:kbriggs@mundoe.maths.mu.oz.au\">kbriggs@mundoe.maths.mu.oz.au</A> (Keith Briggs rba8 7088)\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Conformal maps\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:edgar@mps.ohio-state.edu\">edgar@mps.ohio-state.edu</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n  I have done some refined pixel counting and\nmy best result is\n Total Mset area=  1.499936.\nOn this basis I conjecture that the exact value is 3/2.\nHowever, this number is not universal in the way that the feigenvalues are,\nsince it varies with reparameterization of the map z^2+c.

We can for each period, p, count around\nthe Cardioid.  Let's name the buds (i,p), the i-th bud with\nperiod p.\n\nn:=0;\nfor p:=1 to inf do\n  for i:=1 to p do\n    n:=n+1;\n\nBut we find we already counted some. For example, (2,4) is\nthe same bud as (1,2).  The modified loop is\n\nn:=0; m:=0;\nfor p:=1 to inf do\n  for i:=1 to p do\n    if gcd(i,p)=1 then\n      n:=n+1\n    else\n      m:=m+1;\n\nwhere m will count the duplicates. To count the buds on buds,\nwe must make this algorithm recursive. When we are done, we\ncan also count the island Mandelbroties, l. They will be\n\nl = 2^p - (n+m) - Mandelbrotie buds.\n\nTable I shows the results of this calculation.  We can also\nkeep a running total of the number of buds.  The total for\neach doubling of the period is shown in Table II.  The last\ncolumn shows the ratio of the total with each doubling which\napproaches 5.56.  An approximate formula for the total is\n\n  Total buds, T = 5.56^(ln2(p/2)) = 5.56^(-1+1.442695*ln(p))\n                = exp( 2.46*ln(p)-1.7 )\n\nThe density of buds is approximately\n\n  dT/dp = (0.45/p)*exp( 2.46*ln(p) )\n\nNow if we use Milnor's bud radius formula r=sin(pi*i/p)/(p*p),\nwe can estimate the area of the Cardioid plus attached buds.\nThe formula is not good for buds on buds, however if I use it\nanyway, the area approaches 1.507818.  I must point out the\nformula is quite inaccurate, with error as large as 100%.\nTherefore, measured radii for p less than 11 were substituted\nin the revised area estimate, Table III, which approaches\n1.504106.  This is approximate since the bud radii (area) for\nperiods beyond 2 are still unknown.\n\nThe importance of the bud area as a function of p can be\ngauged the total area of all buds and cardioids as a function\nof p.  An estimate based on 'pixel counting' is shown in Table\nIV.  The values for p=1,2 can be compared to the exact values.\n\nA(1) = 3*pi/8 = 1.178097245 (calculated=1.17809694),\n\nA(2) =  pi/16 = 0.196349541 (calculated=0.19634926).\n\nTheir error is about 3e-7.  The calculation used 8192x4096\nsamples in region (-2,-1.125),(0.5,1.125) with an iteration\nlimit of 8388608.  Period detection was used for early exit.\nWhen a period was found, an additional set of iterations were\nused with a fuzzy period test to distinguish the real period\nfrom a multiple.  A simultaneous graphic display showed the\nerrors in the period selection to be very few.  The undecideds\nafter 8388608 iterations were counted.  Only 73 samples out\nof 8987185 were unable to decide to exit or find a period.\nWe can see from Table IV that accurate estimates of bud radii\nwill be needed up to p=48 if we want 5 or 6 digit accuracy.\nThat is 2417 buds on the main Mandelbrot, not an impossible\ntask.  8^)   |-0   &gt;^]   |-(  (Are we having fun yet?)  ;^)\n\n                  Table I\n\nPeriod  Buds

Mandelbrot Set center-of-gravity is -((ln(3)-1/3)^Feig)\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 04 Mar 1998 14:36:24 -0600\n<B>Organization:</B>   Deja News - The Leader in Internet Discussion\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nRecently I restarted the computing effort I undertook\nabout a year ago to\ncompute the area of the Mandelbrot\nSet. After reviewing the notes from that\ntime I saw that there had\nbeen some interest in the past of computing the\nMandelbrot Set's\n\"center of gravity\" as well. I have also done some\noptimizations of\nthe code in the mean time and fixed a few bugs, and have\nstarted\ndoing a long run.\n\nThe method I use involves counting pixels on a\ngrid. There is error\nin the estimate resulting from grid placement and the\nfact that the\ngrid squares on the boundary get counted as completely in or\ncompletely out when in fact only part of their area is in. It is hard\nto\nestimate the magnitude of this error, so I use statistical methods\nto measure\nit. I use a bunch of grids of slightly different grid\nspacings with slight\nvertical and horizontal offsets, and take the\nmean and standard deviation of\nall the runs.\n\nThese are the figures I've compiled so far. Each run is the\naverage\nof 20 grids for which the standard deviations are shown.\n\n  grid \niter  area and  standard  iterations\n  size  limit  center-of-       deviations \ntime (seconds)\n  gravity  (20 runs)  performance (MFLOPs)\n\n  256  65536 \n1.506 38  0.002 31  18,623,118\n  -0.286 741  0.000 912 9.4  13.918\n\n  512 \n131072  1.506 87  0.001 35  82,659,183\n  -0.286 881  0.000 417 40.2  14.376\n\n  1024  262144  1.506 782  0.000 493  372,533,718\n  -0.286 802    0.000 173 \n176  14.839\n\n  2048  524288  1.506 674       0.000 151  1,716,452,044\n  -0.286 811\n0  0.000 074 8  788  15.246\n\n  4096  1048576  1.506 584 0  0.000 074 4 \n7,933,339,783\n        -0.286 765 8  0.000 024 8  3,580  15.502\n\n  8192  2097152 \n1.506 593 6  0.000 027 7  36,987,339,092\n  -0.286 769 51  0.000 009 73 \n16,300  15.852\n\n 16384  4194304  1.506 588 1  0.000 012 7  171,493,547,507\n \n-0.286 767 27  0.000 003 20  74,400  16.138\n\n 32768  8388608  1.506 591 50 \n0.000 004 51  814,136,316,927\n        -0.286 768 37  0.000 001 77  347,000  16.442\n\n 65536 16777216  1.506 592 31  0.000 001 90  3,844,750,451,387\n  -0.286 768\n423  0.000 000 510  1,630,000  16.529\n\n131072 33554432 1.506 591 734  0.000\n000 624  18,173,551,931,685\n  -0.286 768 317  0.000 000 295  7,590,000 \n16.754\n\nFor each average, the standard deviation gives the expected error\nin\neach of the 20 individual grids. The expected error of the mean\nis 1/sqrt(19)\nof the standard deviation (this is called \"the standard\nerror of the mean\").\nI use 1/3 as a conservative estimate. So, my\nbest estimate of the\ncenter-of-gravity is -0.28676832 +- 0.00000010.\nFor the area, we have\n1.50659173 +- 0.00000020.\n\nThe Inverse Symbolic Calculator is a resource at\nthe URL\n\n  <A HREF=\"http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ISCmain.html\">http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/projects/ISC/ISCmain.html</A>\n\nwhich can be\nused to guess what expression produces a given numeric\nvalue. I plugged in\nthe values 1.50659173 and 0.28676832. I saw\nnothing interesting for the area\nbut for the center of gravity it\ngives\n\n  -((ln(3)-1/3) ^ Feig1).\n\nFeig1 is\nthe larger Faigenbaum constant, whose value is\n4.6692016091029906718532038,\nand shows up in the Mandelbrot Set as\nthe ratio of the radii of successive\nmu-atoms on the real axis.\nPlugging in this value we get the following\nhypothetical precise\nvalue of the Mandelbrot Set's center of gravity:\n\n-0.2867682633829350268529586\n\nA few other observations:\n\n- My program\ncurrently runs at about 2.39 million Mandelbrot iterations\n  per second (each\niteration requires 7 floating-point operations).\n  The latest model Macs are\nabout 4 times faster. Intel machines get\n  nowhere close because they don't\nhave enough floating-point registers\n  to keep the pipeline full.\n\n- Each\ntime I double the grid size it takes almost 4.7 times as long.\n  The current\nrate of progress in computer performance is\n  about 1.56 per year; at that\nrate it takes about 3.5 years\n        to increase computing power by 4.7.\n\n- Each\ntime the gridsize is doubled the error goes down to about 0.4\n        of the\nprevious value (but it varies from 0.3 to 0.55). It would take\n  about 8 to\n10 years for personal computers to improve enough to give\n  us one more digit\nin the area estimate (given the same run time).\n\n- Robert Munafo\n  Malden\nMassachusetts\n        4 March 1998\n  <A HREF=\"mailto:rpm%mrob.uucp@spdcc.com\">rpm%mrob.uucp@spdcc.com</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
