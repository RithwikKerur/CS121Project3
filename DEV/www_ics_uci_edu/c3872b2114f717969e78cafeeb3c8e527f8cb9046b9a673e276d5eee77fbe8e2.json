Alzheimer's\ndisease can also affect other ages.  Some patients may have symptoms as early\nas the fifth decade of life.\nPeople with Alzheimer's disease suffer from a progressive deterioration\nin cognitive performance.  Typical symptoms also include confusion and \nforgetfulness.\n<p>\n<img src=\"staff.gif\">\nAlzheimer's exact <A HREF=\"http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/adcause.html\">causes</A> are still unknown.  However, current research has found evidence to isolate\nindividuals who are at high risk to the disease; \none of them being heredity.  Others also\nat risk are a small portion of the population who possess mutations in the\n<A HREF=\"http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/adapp.html\"><I>amyloid protein precursor\n or APP</I></A> protein localized on chromosome 21.\nA large number of the population suffering from the disease are associated with\na locus on chromosome 14.  But because Alzheimer's disease is common in this\nregion, its precise disease gene can not yet be determined.  Most Alzheimer's\npatients have been found to possess one or two copies of the EA allele of the\n<A HREF=\"http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/adcause.html\">apolipoprotein E</A> gene \nfound on chromosome 19.  Persons with the same background are at severe risk to\nthe disease.  Environmental risks such as head traumas and aluminum toxicity\nhave also been identified.  One cause proposal, known as the \n<A HREF=\"http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/adcholin.html\">cholinergic hypothesis</A>, \nsuggests that the reduction in cognitive levels can be caused by a deficiency\nin cholinergic neurotransmission.\n<p>\nMore information about Alzheimer's disease can be found at the \n<A HREF=\"http://werple.mira.net.au/~dhs/ad.html\">Alzheimer Web Home Page</A>.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><img align=middle src=\"return.gif\" alt=\"\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a><p>\n\n<HR>\n<p>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What is the subject of Paleontology about?</H2></A>\n<img src=\"pubguy.gif\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"./dino.xbm\">\n<A HREF=\"http://ucmp1.berkeley.edu/paleowhat.html\">Paleontology</A> is \na vastly diverse field, divulged in the fascinating pursuit of \nseeing the \"long and interesting past and even more intriguing and hopeful \nfuture\".  It's much much more than the study of fossils.  It is the progress\nof discovering the ecologies of the past, seeing new ideas and facts \nabout evolution, and finding out about where we, as humans, \nbelong in this world---all through the study of fossils. \nIt is phenomenally diverse in the way it pools its repository of knowledge\nfrom several different areas, such as: biology, geology, ecology,\nanthropology, archeology, and, yes, even computer science to analyze and\ncomprehend the ways the world has evolved and will continue to evolve. \n<p>\nHow do I know this and why do I sound excited describing it?

Voyager is an Intrepid-class vessel with a 200 \ncrew member capacity.  Despite being smaller than the U.S.S. Enterprise,\nVoyager is technologically superior than all previous Star Trek vessels and\nis among the fastest and most powerful starships in Starfleet.  Despite\nits intent of being an exploration and research vessel, Voyager's impressive\ndefensive and offensive capabilities make aggressors think twice before\nengaging it in battle.  \n\n<p>\nIn Voyager's <A HREF=\"http://voyager.paramount.com/VoyagerMission01.html\">first \nmission</A> to investigate the disappearance of a Marquis\nship, Voyager is swept up by a strange cosmic force and phenomenon and\nsent to the outskirts of the galaxy, where traveling at warp speeds it would\ntake an astounding seventy years for the ship to return home.  \nUnder the tough and commanding helm of \n<A HREF=\"http://voyager.paramount.com/VoyagerPerson01.html\">\nCaptain Kathryn Janeway</A>, Voyager's \nobjective is to now both explore new worlds and find a way to return home.\n<p>\nMore background information about the U.S.S Voyager can be found at\n<A HREF=\"http://voyager.paramount.com/VoyagerMenu.html\">Voyager's homepage.</A>\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><img align=middle src=\"return.gif\" alt=\"\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a><p>\n\n<HR>\n\n<p>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>What is a URL?</H2></A>\n<img src=\"www.gif\" alt=\"\">\n<A HREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/url.html\">URL</A> is an\nacronym for Uniform Resource Locator.  It is the manner in which documents or\ndata available on the World Wide Web are addressed or referenced.  A \n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html#url\">URL</A>  \nspecifies 4 things:\n<OL>\n<LI>the agreed upon standard method for transferring the data, known as the \nprotocol\n<LI>the internet name of the site or server providing the requested resource\n<LI>the <I>internet port number</I>\n<LI>the location of the resource in the server's directory structure\n</OL>\n<p>\nURL's look like this:\n<UL>\n<LI>http://info.cern.ch:80/default.html\n<LI>ftp://wuarchive.wustle.edu/mirrors/msdos/grapchics/gifkit.zip\n<LI>telnet://netcom.com\n</UL>\n<p>\nThe protocols seen in the listed examples are \n<A HREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/url_http.html\">http</A>, \n<A HREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/url_ftp.html\">ftp</A>, \nand \n<A HREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_telnet.html\">telnet</A>. \nOther protocols not seen include: <A HREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_gopher.html\">gopher</A>, \n<A HREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_wais.html\">WAIS searches</A>. \n<A HREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_news.html\">News</A>, \nand\n<A HREF=\"http://www.utirc.utoronto.ca/HTMKdocs/NewHTML/url_mailto.html\">Mailto</A>.\nThe portions after the colon and two slashes indicate the name of the servers;\n<I>info.cern.ch</I>, <I>wuarchive.wustl.edu</I>, and <I>Netcom.com</I> in the\nlisted examples.  Only the first example specifies a port number; 80 in its \ncase.  If no port number is specified, as in the last two seen examples, \nthen it is defaulted to 0.  The final portions of the URL is the path of the\nobject. In our second example <SAMP>/mirrors/msdos/grapchics/</SAMP> is the path\nwith <I>gifkit.zip</I> as the desired resource.  If no path is given, then\nthe URL defaults to the root directory as the path.  URL's with a specified\nport number may have already an understood path associated with it.  And \nif no resource or object is given, the available resources in \nthe path are listed for the viewer's selection---<i>this \nis as far as I know with http only; I've not been able to try it out \nthe circumstances with other protocols</I>.\n\n \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><img align=middle src=\"return.gif\" alt=\"\" ><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a><p>\n\n<HR>\n<p>\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>What are some neat inlined image and icons I can use to spice up my HTML?</H2></A>\n<img src=\"gopher.gif\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"warning.gif\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"spider.gif\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"caution.gif\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"construction.gif\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"animaniacs.gif\" alt=\"\">\n<img src=\"fraid.gif\" alt=\"\">\n<p>\nThis seems to be a popular topic.  Even as I was working on this document,\nI've already been approached by at least half a dozen people asking.   \nHere's two ways I've found from reading the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/www_faq.html\">WWW FAQ file</A> I found locally\nthru a link in the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">ICS 1C homepage</A> \nand remotely through various other\nplaces---I must have ran into this link about a dozen times from different\nhome pages in one sitting. \n<OL>\n<LI>Load the html page you see the image you like.  Switch on the <B>Load to \nLocal Disk</B> option if you have it.  Then \nselect the <B>Reload Images</B>.  You will then be\nprompted for names of the image files as they arrive and await to be saved.  \nIn my own attempts as this, the X version of Mosaic that I use seems to want\nto only save the html document and no images.  Perhaps it's just an error with\nmy current version.  Try it yourself with on your own Mosaic copy/version or \nother browser, whatever it may be.\n<LI>Find out the URL of the image you like by viewing the source of its\nHTML document.  Then open do an \"Open URL\" on it.  Your add-on that you use\nto view images with your browswer will display it for you.  And if \nit's not one of those cheesy ones,\nit'll permit you to save the image to your local disk. \n</ol>\n<P>\nThe other (brute force) method is to hunt down \nthese images yourself tediously by looking\nat public archives of pictures and icons.
