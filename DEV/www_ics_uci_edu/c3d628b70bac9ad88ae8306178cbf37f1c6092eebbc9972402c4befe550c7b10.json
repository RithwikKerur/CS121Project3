Define the <i>bandwidth</i> of a layout\nto be the maximum number of such intervals covering any point of the real \nline.  For instance, if G has vertices with coordinates 1,2,3,4, and\nedges (1,3) (2,3) (3,4) and (1,4), then the bandwidth of this layout is \nthree, since three of the intervals cover the value 2.5.</p>\n\n<p>The bandwidth of G itself is defined to be the minimum bandwidth of any \nlayout of G.  For instance, the layout above is not the best possible: the \nsame graph has a layout with bandwidth two, so the bandwidth of G in this \nexample is two.  Two layouts are equivalent (and have the same bandwidth) \nif they form the same permutation of the vertices,\nso one can compute the bandwidth of G by generate and test in time O(n!).\n\n<p>The homework problem is to devise a more efficient dynamic programming \nalgorithm for computing the bandwidth of a given graph.</p>\n\n<p>Hint:\nif you choose to permute the vertices so that some subset S is placed\nwith smaller coordinates than everything not in S, then what is the \noptimal layout of S, and what can you say about the overall bandwidth of \nthe layout?</p>\n\n<h3>Due <a href=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">by email</a>\nMonday, Nov. 13, 11:59PM.</h3>\n\nPlease <b>do not send MS Word</b> or other proprietary formats.\nPlain text, TeX, HTML, or PDF are all acceptable.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
