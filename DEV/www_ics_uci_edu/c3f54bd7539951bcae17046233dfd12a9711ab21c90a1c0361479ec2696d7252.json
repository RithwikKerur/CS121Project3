On the other hand, working in the lab has some genuine\r\nbenefits, particularly for those of you who are new to ICS. In the lab,\r\nyour development environment will be the same as the production\r\nenvironment, so you won't have to worry about whether what you wrote \"at\r\nhome\" will work \"in the lab.\" It's also a great place to work with your\r\npartner, and to talk over assignments with other ICS 45J students. It\r\nalso tends to be less distracting than working elsewhere.\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, we're aware that many of you will choose to do some\r\npercentage of your work on your own machines, so, as a courtesy, we\r\nprovide below enough information to have your Windows-based or Macintosh\r\ncomputer support the Eclipse development environment and Oracle's\r\nrelease of Java, using freely available software.\r\n\r\nYou are free to use any development environment you like, but <i>your\r\nresulting programs must work in the \"production environment\" for this\r\ncourse;</i> that is, using Oracle's version of Java running under\r\nEclipse. So, if you are completing the assignments on your own computer,\r\nwe strongly recommend you test them on the lab computers before turning\r\nthem in.</p>\r\n\r\n</div> <div class=\"section\"> <hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Windows and Mac OS X Lion and Mountain Lion\r\ninstallations only</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This document only describes how to set up Sun's Java 7 and Eclipse\r\nClassic (Indigo)--the environment for this class--on a computer running\r\nWindows or Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) or 10.8 (Mountain Lion). To install Java\r\nunder these operating systems, see the applicable section below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(If you want to run Java under a version of Mac OS X prior to Lion,\r\nthere is a version from the OpenJDK group, but it requires a fair bit of Unix and can be \r\ntricky to install; unless you are pretty familiar with Unix programming and package \r\ninstallation on Macs, we suggest update your O/S and install Sun's Java rather than the \r\nOpen OS Java package.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you use Linux or Solaris, JDK 7 Update 7 can be downloaded from <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\r\n\">Java SE Downloads</a>, the same way it can for Windows; we do not\r\ndiscuss the details of installation here, but there is ample\r\ndocumentation available on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Setting up Java on Windows</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Removing Eclipse and previous versions of Java</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, it's best if you delete Eclipse and uninstall all earlier\r\nversions of Java you have installed on your machine. (Use the\r\n\"Add/Remove Programs\" utility in the Microsoft Windows Control Panel to\r\nuninstall Java; delete the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">eclipse</font>\r\nfolder to delete Eclipse.) Leaving old versions causes setup of Java 7\r\nto be more complicated and problematic. Further, an old version of\r\nEclipse will not recognize the new version of Java without some rather\r\nmessy settings changes, whereas installing Eclipse after installing the\r\nnew Java will cause Eclipse to find and use Java 7 without any fuss.  If\r\nyou absolutely must keep older versions of Java on your machine, the\r\ninstructions below may not be sufficient to have the new version of Java\r\nwork correctly&mdash;you'll need to seek additional assistance.\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Getting started</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you'll need to get started is the latest  production (non-beta)\r\nversion of the Java SE 7 JDK (JDK 7) from <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\r\n\">Java SE Downloads</a>, since this is the version we use in the lab. \r\nJust click on the  <font class = \"codefacesmall\">JDK Download </font>\r\nbutton in the Java SE 7u6 section of the screen, accept the\r\nlicense agreement, choose the version of Java that matches your\r\noperating system and save the downloaded <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">exe</font> file. For those using Windows 7 and earlier,\r\nrelated OS, such as Windows Vista, 2000, and XP, choose the download for\r\n<font class = \"codefacesmall\">Windows x86</font> systems. The x86\r\nversion will work even if you have a 64-bit (Itanium-based) machine.\r\n\r\nIf you would rather install the 64-bit (x64) version of Java 7 on your\r\n64-bit machine, go ahead and download the 64-bit vesion's <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">exe</font>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>  Be sure you download the JDK and <i>not</i> the JRE!  The JDK\r\nincludes a Java compiler (<font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font>), a\r\nJava virtual machine (<font class = \"codefacesmall\">java</font>), and\r\nall of the standard Java library components &mdash; in other words,\r\neverything you need to write Java programs in a wide variety of problem\r\ndomains, and more than enough firepower for the assignments we'll be\r\ngiving you.  (The JRE is the Java Runtime Environment, which includes\r\nthe necessary code to allow you to <i>run</i> Java programs, but not to\r\nwrite and compile them.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Installation: the easy part</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The JDK includes an installation program, which places all of the\r\nfiles into the appropriate places and sets up some desktop shortcuts for\r\nyou: Double-click on the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">exe</font> file\r\nyou downloaded; if asked, say \"yes\" to allowing the program to modify\r\nyour computer, and then follow the instructions on the installation\r\nscreens (it's typically best to just accept the default settings).\r\n\r\nOn 32-bit machines, the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Java</font> folder\r\nwill be put inside the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Program\r\nFiles</font> folder on the C: drive; that is, its path will be <font\r\nclass = \"codefacesmall\">C:\\Program Files\\Java</font>. However, if you\r\nare installing the 64-bit version of Java, or the 32-bit version on a\r\n64-bit machine, the path may well be different. <i>Do make a note of the\r\nexact path used.</i> You will need it for the steps below.\r\n\r\n<p>Once Java is installed, the installation program may bring up a\r\nscreen for you to install JavaFX. We do not use Java FX in this course,\r\nso feel free to cancel that (part of the) installation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When installation completes, you'll be taken to a web page to\r\nregister your installation; registration is optional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With installation complete, you still won't be able to readily\r\nexecute <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font> or <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">java</font> until you set the PATH and CLASSPATH\r\nproperly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Setting the PATH and CLASSPATH: the (not all that)\r\nhard part: </p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can execute programs from a command prompt by simply typing their\r\nnames, such as <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font> or <font class\r\n= \"codefacesmall\">java</font>. And Eclipse iissues these commands behind\r\nhte scenes when you run a program inside Eclipse. But there's a catch:\r\nComand prompt and Eclipse need to know where to find these programs. \r\nThat is the job of the PATH environment variable.  Whenever a command to\r\nexecute a program is given (either by you or some running process on the\r\ncomputer), Windows looks for it in the list of folders in the PATH. Each\r\nfolder in the PATH list is separated from the next by a semicolon;\r\n<i>forgetting or misplacing semicolons or backslashes is a major cause\r\nof the PATH not finding javac or java</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, whenever the Java compiler or Java virtual machine needs\r\nto be able to use a Java class (such as when you import a class from the\r\nJava library), the compiler or virtual machine needs to know where to\r\nfind it.  This is the job of the CLASSPATH environment variable. \r\nCLASSPATH is a list of folders, separated by semicolons, in which the\r\nJava compiler or virtual machine will look for a Java class whenever\r\nit's trying to find one. <i>Forgetting or misplacing semicolons or\r\nbackslashes is a major cause of the CLASSPATH not finding clases your\r\nprogram needs.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to make the JDK work, you have to modify the PATH and CLASSPATH\r\nenvironment variables on your system so that Windows will be able to\r\nfind <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font> and <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">java</font>, and so that <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">javac</font> and <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">java</font> will be able to find all of the necessary\r\nJava classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How you get to these environment variables is slightly different on\r\ndifferent versions of Windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>On Windows 7 and Vista</i>, click the start orb in the lower-left\r\ncorner of the screen, move your mouse over <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">Computer</font>, right-click, and select <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">Properties</font> from the pop-up menu.  Click the <font\r\nclass = \"codefacesmall\">Advanced System Settings</font> link, then click\r\nthe <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Environment Variables...</font>\r\nbutton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>On Windows XP and 2000</i>, right-click the <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">My Computer</font> icon on your desktop and select <font\r\nclass = \"codefacesmall\">Properties</font>.  Select the <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">Advanced</font> tab.  Click the <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">Environment Variables...</font> button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you've brought up the environment variables, find the PATH\r\nvariable listed under \"System variables\". If Java was never previously\r\ninstalled on this machine,  add  to the <i>end</i> of the PATH the path\r\nto the Java folder that the installation program created. If you are\r\nusing a 32-bit Java, the text to add is</p>\r\n\r\n<pre> ;C:Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_06\\bin </pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Do note the semicolon (;) that starts the text: it must be\r\npresent.</p>\r\n\r\nIf you installed Java on a 64-bit machine, you might need to change\r\nthe<font class = \"codefacesmall\"> \\Program Files\\Java</font> part of the\r\ntext above to match the path to the Java folder on your machine; for\r\nexample, if Java was installed in the <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">\\Program Files (x86)</font> folder, the path text would\r\nbe\r\n\r\n<pre> ;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_06\\bin </pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If Java was previously installed, somewhere in the PATH there is\r\nlikely to be text very similar to the above, differing only in the text\r\nbetween  <font class=\"codefacesmall\">jdk</font>(and <font\r\nclass=\"codefacesmall\">\\bin</font>). Change that part of the path to match\r\nthe text above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To check that the PATH is properly set, call up a <i>new</i> Command\r\nPrompt window and enter <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac\r\n-version</font>.</p> If you see <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac\r\n1.7.0_06</font> or similar text, your path is properly set. If you\r\ninstead get an error message that javac cannot be found, the PATH is not\r\nright; you'll need to go back and fix it.\r\n\r\n<p>Now find the CLASSPATH variable.  If it doesn't exist (and it\r\nprobably won't, if you've never used your system to develop Java code),\r\nclick the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">New...</font> button, specifying\r\nCLASSPATH as the name, and, for the value, the same text you used for\r\nthe PATH variable, except have it end in <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">lib</font> instead of <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">bin</font>. For example, the CLASSPATH text for a\r\nstandard 32-bit Java installation would be</p>\r\n\r\n<pre> .;C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk1.7.0_06\\lib </pre>\r\n\r\n<p>If the CLASSPATH does exist, which it likely will if Java was \r\npreviously installed on this computer, change the CLASSPATH value text\r\nto match the text you added to your PATH,  replacing <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">bin</font> with <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">lib</font>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're using <font class = \"codefacesmall\">javac</font> and <font\r\nclass = \"codefacesmall\">java</font> from the command line, you will need\r\nto bring up a new Command Prompt window, in order for these changes to\r\ntake effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">That's it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, your Java installation is ready to go; you're now\r\nready to proceed to installing Eclipse.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Setting up Eclipse on Windows</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Downloading Eclipse</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several different distirbutions of Eclipse available for\r\ndownload at <a href=\"http://eclipse.org/\">eclipse.org</a>, each geared\r\ntoward users with differentneeds, such as Java programming and web\r\ndevelopment. For our work in this course, we expect you to be using\r\n<b>Eclipse Classic 4.2</b>.  Start by downloading it: click on the big\r\n<font class = \"codefacesmall\">Download Eclipse</font> button, then find \r\nEclipse Classic 4.2. If you are using Windows 7 or an earlier, related\r\nOS such as Vista, 2000, or XP, click the <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">Windows 32 Bit</font> button; if you have a 64-bit\r\nmachine, you can download the 64-bit version of Classic instead. Then\r\nclick on a download site and save the downloaded ZIP file to your\r\ncomputer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"subtitle\">Installing Eclipse</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eclipse is distributed as files in a Zip archive and, unlike most\r\nsoftware you install on Windows, has no installation program.  Instead,\r\nyou do a few things on your own.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul> <li>Find the <font class = \"codefacesmall\">.zip</font> file that\r\nyou downloaded.  Extract it to <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">C:\\eclipse</font>, or somewhere else you feel\r\ncomfortable putting it.  (On Windows 7, you can extract it by opening\r\nthe ZIP folder and draging the enclosed <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">Eclipse</font> folder to where you want to store\r\neclipse.) The extraction process is likely to take a while; a few\r\nminutes or more is not uncommon.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Once you've extracted Eclipse into a folder, go into that folder. \r\nFind the file <font class = \"codefacesmall\">eclipse.exe</font> &mdash;\r\nit may show up as <font class = \"codefacesmall\">eclipse</font> if you\r\nhave Windows Explorer configured to hide file extensions, but you can\r\nrecognize it because its icon will be the circular purple logo you see\r\nat <a href=\"http://eclipse.org/\">eclipse.org</a>.</li> </ul>\r\n\r\n<p>From here, your next step depends on which version of Windows you're\r\nrunning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>On Windows 7</i>.  Double-click on <font class =\r\n\"codefacesmall\">eclipse.exe</font> to start Eclipse.  When asked for a\r\nworkspace, use the default for now.  Once the program starts, you'll see\r\nthe Eclipse icon show up on your taskbar.  Right-click that icon and\r\nselect <font class = \"codefacesmall\">Pin this program to taskbar</font>,\r\nso that you'll be able to run Eclipse any time you'd like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>On Windows 2000, XP, and Vista</i>.  Right-click on the <font\r\nclass = \"codefacesmall\">eclipse.exe</font> file you found, select <font\r\nclass = \"codefacesmall\">Create Shortcut</font> to create a shortcut to\r\nallow you to run Eclipse.  Drag this shortcut to your desktop or Quick\r\nLaunch bar.  You can then use this shortcut to open Eclipse any time\r\nyou'd like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That's it!
