V. Morley wrote a book _Inversive_Geometry_, Ginn &amp; Co.,\nBoston, 1933, that includes a description of the complete 4-line and Wallace's\ntheorem, the 5-line and the Miquel circle, and the 6-line and the Clifford\npoint.  They complete their book with a chapter on the n-line which describes\nClifford's chain:\n\n  The theorem of Clifford is as follows.  Two lines, say 1 and 2, have a\n  common point 12.  Three lines 1, 2, 3 have three common points 12, 23, 31\n  which lie on a circle 123.  Four lines have four circumcircles 123 which are\n  on a point 1234.  Five lines give five such points which lie on a circle\n  12345.  An so on.  We thus get the complete n-line, the lines 1,2,...,n\n    meeting in (n choose 2) points 12,...\n    these lying on (n choose 3) circles 123,...\n    these meeting in (n choose 4) points 1234,...\n  ending with a point or a circle 123...n as n is even or odd.  Regarding the\n  lines as circles on the point infinity, we have the Clifford configuration\n  /Gamma n of 2^(n-1) points and and 2^(n-1) circles, each point on n circles\n  and each circle on n points.\n\n&gt;-- \n&gt;David E.
