We present our results in a manner that\nhighlights this research process involved in solving computer science\nproblems.\n<P>\nThe problem of powering down is encountered when any energy intensive\nsystem goes through an idle period of time. Many systems are designed\nwith  different  levels of  sleep states that consume energy at\ndifferent rates and have different power-up costs. We initiate this\nstudy by presenting several models that are increasingly more accurate\nin capturing the essence of the problem. Along with these models, we\nintroduce the notion of competitive ratio, which is the theoretical\nframework for analyzing online algorithms and present an algorithm that\nis provably within a small error factor of the best possible competitive\nratio.\n<P>\nWe will conclude with a summary of other previous work and a plan for\nfuture research in collaboration with undergraduate students.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
