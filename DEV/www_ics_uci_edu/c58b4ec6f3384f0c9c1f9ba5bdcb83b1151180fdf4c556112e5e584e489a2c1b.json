We ask\nhow entangled the ground state of a FF quantum spin-<i>s</i> chain with\nnearest-neighbor interactions can be for small values\nof&nbsp;<i>s</i>. While FF spin-1/2 chains are known to have unentangled\nground states, the case <i>s</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 remains less explored. We\npropose the first example of a FF translation-invariant spin-1 chain\nthat has a unique highly entangled ground state and exhibits some\nsignatures of a critical behavior. The ground state can be viewed as the\nuniform superposition of balanced strings of left and right parentheses\nseparated by empty spaces.  Entanglement entropy of one half of the\nchain scales as (1/2)&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>&nbsp;+&nbsp;O(1),\nwhere <i>n</i> is the number of 2 spins. We prove that the energy gap\nabove the ground state is polynomial in 1/<i>n</i>. The proof relies on\na new result concerning statistics of Dyck paths which might be of\nindependent interest.\n</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5801\">a paper\nin <i>Phys.
