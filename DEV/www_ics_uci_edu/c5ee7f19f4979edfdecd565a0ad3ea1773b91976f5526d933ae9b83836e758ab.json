The process starts\nwith a single node knowing the rumor.\nWe show that the number $S_n$ of rounds required to spead a rumor in a\ncomplete graph with $n$ nodes is very closely described by $log_2 n$\nplus $(1/n)$ times the completion time of the coupon collector\nprocess. This in particular gives very precise bounds for the expected\nruntime of the process, namely $\\lfoor \\log_2 n \\rfloor + \\ln n -\n1.116 \\le E[S_n] \\le \\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil + \\ln n + 2.765 + o(1)$.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
