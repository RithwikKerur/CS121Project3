We assume\nthat you would like to learn what sort of research is\ngoing on, which people do what, and how to get connected with a\nresearch project.  The purpose of this course is to help you answer\nthose questions.\n\n<p>\n\nTwo types of students take this course:\nstudents in the ICS Honors Program (ICSHP), and students in the Campuswide\nHonors Program (CHP).  In many ways the requirements are the same for\nboth types of students: you are to select a faculty advisor,\ndo two or more quarters of research with that advisor,\nand produce a report which is considered to be of honors quality.\n\n<p>\n\nStudents in the Campuswide Honors Program should discuss their plans\nwith counsellors in the CHP, in order to make sure that they are\nmeeting the research requirements of that program.\n\n<p>\n\nTwo people primarily oversee the ICS Honors Program: the <i> honors\nprogram advisor </i> (or more briefly just the <i> program\nadvisor</i>) is the faculty member in charge of the program, currently\nRichard Lathrop.  The counsellor for the program, currently Neha\nRawal, will help orient students and track their progress.  Feel\nfree to ask us any questions about the Program.\n\n<p>\n\nThe most important person for you is your <i> honors advisor </i> (note\nthat this is different from the program advisor). This is the faculty member\nwith whom you will do your project, and varies from student to\nstudent.\n\n<p>\n\nSeveral types of meetings are planned for this seminar, including the\nfollowing.\n\n<li> We will meet with you \nto give you an overview of the programs.  \n\n<li> Most of the faculty research groups will give a presentation\nabout their research interests.\n\n<li> We plan that current graduate students, and past or present \nhonors students, will meet with you to discuss their experiences, and\nto help give you a perspective on the research process from students'\npoints of view.\n\n<li> We plan several special topics, including graduate school\nand fellowships, use of the library as a research tool,\nscientific writing and speaking, and possibly intellectual property\nor scientific ethics.\n\n\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\nOne of your major goals in this course is to gain an understanding of\nwhat research is being pursued in the Department and what areas might\nbe of interest to you for your project.  This is crucial, since it\nshould help you complete your second goal, selection of your honors\nadvisor.  Remember that the arrangement must be mutually acceptable,\nso there is no guarantee that the first faculty member you talk to\nwill say yes; it may be, for example, that they have no suitable\nproject in mind at the time you ask.\n\n<p>\n\nYou should plan to complete your research by winter quarter of your\nsenior year.  It is not imperative that you begin your research\nimmediately next quarter if your schedule for graduation allows you\nenough time.  However, there are some important advantages to starting\nfairly soon, and we encourage you to begin by spring quarter.\nStarting early gives you more flexibility with regard to finishing the\nrest of your degree requirements, especially if you want to continue\nthe research for more than two quarters.  Also, students often find\nthat faculty who have supervised their honors research project are\ngood sources of letters of recommendation; if you wait until your\nsenior year to start your research, you may have to ask for letters of\nrecommendation before you have even completed your first quarter of\nresearch.\n\n<p>\n\n<h3>\nCourse requirements:\n</h3>\n\nThis course is graded Pass/Not Pass, and the principal formal\nrequirement is that you attend and participate.  Several of the class\nexercises involve students giving feedback to fellow students, and\nyour active participation is necessary for everyone to get the most\nbenefit from this.  Occasional absences are inevitable given busy\nschedules, and will be excused on a case-by-case basis; in general if\nyou have a reason to miss class it is OK, and otherwise you should\nattend.  Make sure you sign the attendance sheet each class period you\nattend.  (I will ask for a volunteer from the class to collect this\nsheet each time and place it in my ICS mail box.)\n\n<p>\n\nAdditionally, we will require a series of mini-assignments to help get\nyou started on doing research.  These will be intended to introduce\nyou to some of the basic steps in research: making collaborative\ncontacts, reviewing the literature, speaking, and writing, as well as\nto make you aware of scholarship and graduate school opportunities.\nSome of the possibilities we are considering include (a) research\nscholarship opportunities; (b) attend the Grad School workshop, go to\nthe grad school fair, research one grad school, write up a brief\nreport; (c) literature search and write-up; (d) attend one colloqium\nor seminar during the quarter, write up a brief report; (e) read one\nresearch paper from the literature, criticize it; (f) make contact\nwith potential faculty members; (g) prepare short scientific or\ntechnical abstracts and talks.  We would like your feed-back as to\nwhich of these would be most useful.\n\n<p>\n\n<h3>\nICS 198: Honors Research:\n</h3>\n\nTo complete the honors program you must do two quarters of\nindependent, supervised work (ICS 198) with your faculty advisor.  For\nICS majors, one of these 198s will substitute for one project course\nin the area, <i> provided </i> that\nthe other project course you take is in a different area.\n(In some cases, your advisor might ask\nyou to take a graduate course to substitute for the first quarter.)\nPassing the 198s does not necessarily guarantee successful completion\nof the honors program, however.  For the ICSHP, the results of your\nhonors work must be certified by your advisor and by the program advisor to be\nof honors quality.  (Again, students in the CHP should keep in touch\nwith counsellors in that program about the requirements.)\n\n<p>\n<h3>\nFinding an <i>  honors advisor: </i>\n</h3>\n\nYou are responsible for making contact with faculty members to discuss\ntheir research and find an advisor.  We require you to make at least\nthree contacts every quarter until you have found an advisor and\nsubmitted the ``Initial Plan'' described next.  Until the ``Initial\nPlan'' has been submitted, you must submit a ``Faculty Contact\nReport'' to the Counselling Office every quarter.  This gives a brief\none-paragraph summary of the faculty contacts you have made in the\nprevious quarter (at least three).  This requirement begins the\nquarter you take ICS H197.\n\n<p>\n\nTo make a faculty contact, (a) review the department Computing\nResearch Review to determine research interests; (b) call or email\nin advance, ask for any background reading material, and schedule an\nappointment; (c) read the background material, if any, and possibly\nmake a trip to the library to find out more about the general area;\n(d) show up for the interview prepared with a list of points about the\nresearch area that you find interesting, and a list of questions about\nthe area that you would like to know more about; (e) after the\ninterview, send a thank-you note thanking the faculty member for their\ntime.\n\n<p>\n\nIt is important not to be discouraged if your first few contacts don't\nresult in finding an appropriate faculty advisor.  Keep trying.  You\ncan improve your chances by first doing even more background reading\nin the area before you talk to a faculty member, so that you appear to\nbe interested and informed.  You can also improve your chances by\ntalking to a wider variety of faculty members, which will expose you\nto a wider range of research possibilities.  Do be sensitive to their\ntime constraints; don't be a bother, but do be persistent.\n\n<p>\n\n<h3>\nGetting started:\n</h3>\n\nWhen you have found an advisor, work out a plan for how you\nwill begin to tackle the research.  Then fill out the ``Initial Plan''\nform at the end of this document.  (In some cases your plan might be a\nprogram of study at first, rather than a description of your specific\nproject.  In any case, though, a brief description of your plans and\ngoals should be included.)  This should be approved by both you and\nyour advisor, and submitted to the program advisor.  You are encouraged to discuss\nyour plans with the program advisor as they are forming.\n\nIt is important for you to maintain contact with your advisor, and\nmake sure you know whether s/he feels that your work is progressing\nadequately.  As an extreme example, you want to avoid a situation in\nwhich you don't talk to your advisor after your first meeting, turn in\na paper after two quarters of 198, and then find that the advisor\nconsiders it to be inadequate.  To help avoid this sort of thing,\nschedule regular meetings with your advisor to discuss your progress.\n\n<p>\n\nIf you are in the CHP you should finish your research in accordance\nwith the requirements of the CHP.  The remainder of this document\nformally applies only to ICSHP students.  However, we encourage\nICS students in the CHP also to follow these procedures so that we can keep\ntrack of your progress.\n\n<p>\n<h3>\nCompleting the program:\n</h3>\n\n\nAt the end of your second quarter\nof independent study with your advisor, you should prepare a paper\ndescribing the project and the results.  Again, the format may vary\nconsiderably from one project to another.  For example, one student\nmight produce a well-documented program to be used in a lab in one of\nour courses, and also provide a paper describing the design choices,\nrationale, and experience with the use of the program.  Another\nstudent might not do any programming, but rather do a statistical\nstudy of the use of computers in some organization, and write a\ncareful scholarly interpretation of the results (perhaps 20 pages)\nwith appropriate references to the literature.\n\n<p>\n\nAfter the paper is complete, first have your advisor sign the ``Final\nReport on the Honors Project'' form, then bring the signed form and\nthe paper to the program advisor to sign, and finally bring the form\nwith both signatures and the paper to the Counselling Office.  The\nnormal deadline is June 1; if you will be late, please make\narrangements with the Counselling Office well in advance.  Once the\npaper is approved by your advisor and the form is signed by both\nadvisors, you are considered to have successfully completed the ICSHP.\n\n<p>\n\nIf at any point in this process you have any questions, don't hesitate\nto discuss them with the program advisor or Counselling Office.\n\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<center>\n<H2>Faculty Contact Report for the Honors Project</H2>\n<h3> (To be submitted by the student to the Counselling Office) </h3>\n</center>\n\n<p>\n\nThis form must be filed at the of each quarter until a faculty\nresearch advisor has been found and the ``Initial Plan'' has been\nfiled.\n\n<p>\n\nStudent name and ID#:\n\n<p>\n\nFor which quarter and year:\n\n<p>\n\nPlease describe (by name, date, and result) the faculty contacts\nyou have made this quarter (three per quarter are required).
