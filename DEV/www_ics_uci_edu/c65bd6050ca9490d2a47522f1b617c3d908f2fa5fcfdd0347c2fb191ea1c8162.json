Each offering's topic is announced the preceding spring.</blockquote>\n\n<p>This course will emphasize techniques and notations essential to creating software \n  systems for which there was not adequate time or opportunity in ICS 125 or 126A. \n  A variety of advanced techniques are discussed, depending on the particular \n  applications targeted.\n<p>All students are expected to attend all lecture sections. In general, there \n  will not be much lecturing in the class. Instead, class time will be highly \n  interactive, and all students are expected to participate. About half of the \n  time will be spent performing reviews of the artifacts developed. These reviews \n  will take up all lecture and discussion periods the week following the due date \n  for each deliverable. \n<h3>\nPrerequisites:</h3>  \nICS 125 or 126A; Mathematics 2A-B-C.\n<h3> Is the Lab Section required? </h3>\n\n<p> Yes! The discussion section is essential: You will need to meet with your \n  teammates REGULARLY. EVERYONE needs to be in attendance at team meetings. The \n  discussion section time period is the guaranteed time period for you team to \n  meet. \n<h3>  What will the projects be? </h3>\n\n<p> We'll decide this the first week of classes. Some candidates:\n<ul>\n  <li> A replacement for the Jargo editor</li>\n  <li>An enhancement to the ArchStudio 2.0 environment (see</li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Embergman/ICS125/ICS125_WFUI.htm\">A general \n    workflow editor</a></li>\n  <li>A hand<a href=\"WAP%20Email%20Project.html\">-held email device</a></li>\n  <li>A follow on to one of the ICS125 FQ99 projects (e.g. IMPP, DAV posties, \n    ...) </li>\n</ul>\n<H3> What's the Drop/Add policy?</H3>\n\n<p> Same as ICS 125, and for the same reasons: Since ICS 127 has a strong team \n  project orientation, it is essential that the drop/add process be terminated \n  early. Therefore <em> NO drops or adds </em> will be permitted after the end \n  of the SECOND week of class. \n<hr>\n<h1> Lecture Topics </h1>\n\n<p> Topics will depend upon the interests of the students and the projects chosen. \n  The following list is representative of the topics that might be discussed in \n  class.\n<ul>\n  <li>Software architectures\n  <li>Event-based systems\n  <li>Application-layer Internet protocols\n  <li>Inspections\n  <li>Configuration management and version control\n  <li>Web site usage for project management\n  <li>Testing tools\n  <li>Development environments\n  <li> Usability evaluation and user interface prototyping \n  <li> Distributed software engineering \n  <li> Engineering of distributed applications, including distributed object technology \n</ul>\nSpecific choice of lecture topics will depend somewhat on the projects\nchosen by the teams.  If several of the projects, for example, are\nconcerned with Internet applications, then lectures on protocols and\nWeb technologies will be included.  Similarly if most projects will be\nusing some particular kind of infrastructure, such as CORBA or ActiveX,\nthen there will be lectures on that.\n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"textbooks\"></a>\n<H1> Textbooks </H1>\n\n<p> None required.\n<HR>\n<a name=\"assignments\"></a>\n<h1> Assignments and Assessment </h1>\n<P>\nThe project is the focus of this course and will be assessed\naccordingly.  It will account for 80% of your grade; this is broken\ndown between deliverables, a team Web page, and presentations.  The\nremaining 20% will be divided among individual course logs, teamwork,\nindividual leadership demonstrated, and the final.\n\n<h2>\nDeliverables</h2>\n<div align=\"left\">The project nominally consists of five major assignments. Their \n  relative weighting (as a percentage of your final grade) of each deliverable \n  is indicated in the table below along with the due date. The on-line versions \n  of the assignments may still be under construction (watch the what's new section \n  to see when they are available). <br>\n  &nbsp; <br>\n</div>\n<center>\n  <table BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=2 align=\"left\" >\n    <tr ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=CENTER>\n\n<td VALIGN=CENTER><b>Deliverable</b></td>\n<td><b>Weight&nbsp;</b></td>\n<td><b>Description</b></td>\n<td><b>Due Date</b></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>Individual Web Page</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>.</td>\n      <td>14 January</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Teams Designated</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>.</td>\n      <td>18 January</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Projects Selected/Assigned</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>.</td>\n      <td>20 January</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>Team Web Page</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>.</td>\n      <td>21 January</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Prospectus and Plan&nbsp;</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>10&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99//prospectus.html\">Prospectus&nbsp;</a></td>\n      <td>25 January</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Prospectus Reviews</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n      <td>week 3</td>\n      <td>25 January</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Requirements Specification</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>15&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99//requirements.html\">Requirements&nbsp;</a></td>\n      <td>1 February</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Requirements Reviews</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n      <td>week 4</td>\n      <td>1 February</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Architecture/Module Specifications&nbsp;</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>20&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/design.html\">Architecture/Design&nbsp;</a></td>\n      <td>15 February</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Design Reviews</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n      <td>week 6</td>\n      <td>15 February</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Implementation&nbsp;</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>20&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/implementation.html\">Implementation</a></td>\n      <td>29 February</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Code Reviews</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n      <td>week 8</td>\n      <td>29 February</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>Testing/Test Documentation</td>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<center>15&nbsp;</center>\n</td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/integration-test.html\">Integration/Testing</a></td>\n      <td>14 March</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr VALIGN=CENTER>\n<td VALIGN=CENTER>\n<ul>Demonstrations</ul>\n</td>\n<td>.</td>\n<td>week 10</td>\n      <td VALIGN=CENTER>16 March</td>\n</tr>\n</table></center>\n\n<p> The deliverables are weighted according to the relative amount of time and \n  effort we expect you will spend on each (and not necessarily on their importance \n  with respect to software development). Variations to this may be made to accommodate \n  the particular needs of a given project or a given team. Also, note that the \n  grade for a deliverable will consist not only of the document/specification, \n  developed during that phase but also the test plan developed along side it as \n  well as the review conducted in class. \n<h3>Deliverable Due Dates</h3>\n<p>\nDeliverables are due at 12:50 PM on the date indicated in the table above.\nNO LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED.\nThis applies to your final system and all intermediate projects.\nSince you are working in this class\nas part of team, it is the team's responsibility to ensure that assignments\nare turned in on time.  Normal excuses for late assignments, such as\nillness, do not apply in a team setting (unless of course everyone on the\nteam is ill  :-)\n\n<p> Unless directed otherwise, deliverables must be turned in directly to the \n  instructor or placed in the instructors's mailbox before that time. \n<h3>\nDeliverable Reviews</h3>\nEach deliverable will be reviewed in class. Each team will be given 15-20\nminutes to present their project.  You will be given guidance in class on\nhow to conduct these presentations.\n\n<p>\nYour customer should be invited to your team's Prospectus and Requirements review\nas well as your demonstration (and, possibly even your design and code\nreviews depending on the nature of your customer).&nbsp; The review is\nyour team's chance to inform as well as obtain feedback and ideas from\nall relevant parties; your document will be reviewed at this time by course\nstaff and clients as well as the rest of the class.&nbsp; This review is\na formality, however, and each team should have presented and negotiated\nboth relevant documents to the customer prior to the review (if you haven't,\nit may be unpleasantly obvious by the interactions at this time).\n\n<h3> Document Requirements</h3>\n<P>\nAll the documents associated with the above listed phases are integral\nparts of systematic software development.  Their continued, up-to-date\nexistence is necessary for successful system development.\n<b>Do not delete</b> documents after they have been turned in.  They must\nreside permanently on your team's website.\n\n<P>\nAll deliverable documents must be prepared on-line and be available as part\nof your project home page either as either HTML or .pdf files.  NO MS Word files.\nIn general, the following should be observed.\n<DL ><DT>Cover \"page\".\n<DD> Every deliverable shall have identifying information giving\n<DL ><DT><DD> Project title\n<DT><DD> Development phase and deliverable\n<DT><DD> Date\n<DT><DD> Team name/number\n<DT><DD> Team members\n<DT><DD> Phase manager\n<DT><DD> Phase clerical person\n<DT><DD> Files and locations (href's)\n<P>\n</DL>\n\n<P>\n<DT>Table of Contents.\n<DD> Every deliverable shall include a table of contents\n<DT>Specification.\n<DD> The system specification (requirements, design,\nmodule specs, code) for each deliverable shall correspond in form and\ncontent to the outline provided for that phase.\nSections that are not necessary for this application shall be marked\n``N/A''.\n<DT>Minutes.\n<DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by minutes of\nteam meetings held during the associated period of time.\n\n\n<DT>Performance Appraisals.\n  <DD> Every deliverable shall be accompanied by performance appraisals. Performance \n    appraisals shall NOT be maintained as part of the project's web page. A form \n    is available at <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.pdf\"> \n    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.pdf </a>. \n    A <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/performance_appraisal.ps\"> \n    .ps file </a> is also available. I know that form is for ICS 125, but it will \n    work here too.\n  <DT>Project WebPage.\n<DD> The project deliverables, except for the performance appraisals,  shall be maintained\nin a project homepage.  \n</DL>\n\n\n<h3>``Fixed up'' Deliverables</h3>\n<P>\nFor all deliverables, except for the last, you will also have the opportunity\nto ``fix it'' based on its evaluation.  You may hand in an improved\nversion of a deliverable one week after that deliverable has been\ngraded and receive up to 50% of the points deducted on the initial\nversion.  The purpose of this exercise is for you to both learn how to\nuse the techniques and so that you do not implement something from a\nbad design or specification.  You should keep the\nsame responsibilities for the improvement phase but assign new\nresponsibilities for the next phase.\n\n\n<H3> Course Log</H3>\n<P> Throughout this course, just as in ICS 125, you will keep a course log recording \n  the time you spend on all activities related to this course. At the beginning \n  of each week you must email the previous week's log to the instructor. A sheet \n  showing what should be on the log is available at: <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99//logform.html\"> \n  http://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics125_fq99/logform.html </a>. \n<p>\nKeep a copy of your logs:  you will need them at the end of the quarter for the final\nreview.  \n\n<P>\nEach entry records the date and amount of time spent, type of entry,\nand text describing the entry.  An entry is one of three types:\n<UL><LI> A <i>description</i> records an activity;\n<LI> An <i>explanation</i> says why something happened;\n<LI> A <i>prescription</i> is a plan for something to do later.\n</UL>\n\n<p>\nMost entries will be of the first type, but occasionally you should\nreflect and think about what is going on.\nThe time entry applies for descriptions of activities and records the\namount of time spent in hours, to the nearest quarter hour.\n\n<P>\nYou will be marked down only for failing to email logs each week,\ngiving too little detail, or failing to keep track of time spent.  \n\n<P>\nYou are especially encouraged to keep track of the kinds of errors\nyou make and the amount of time they consume.  The purpose of recording\nthese errors is so that you develop a better understanding of the\nkinds of mistakes you typically make.  With that understanding you\ncan improve your performance in the future, by paying extra attention\nto those areas in which you've had problems in the past.\n\n<hr>\n<a name=\"apportionment\"></a>\n<H1> Team Composition, Activities,  and Peer Apportionment of Credit</H1>\n<P> At the end of the term project you will be asked to divide 100 points among \n  the members of your project team, corresponding to how you believe they contributed \n  to the project as a whole (or on a phase-by-phase basis if you wish). In addition, \n  each team member will be appraised for each phase. This ``peer apportionment \n  of credit'' will be used to help determine appropriate individual grades for \n  the project component. \n<p> You are <b>strongly</b> advised to consult weekly with the instructor/TA about \n  your progress, problems, questions, etc. \n<HR>\n<a name=\"touch\"></a>\n<H1> Keeping in Touch </H1>\nCheck the course syllabus page regularly<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Etaylor/ics127/syllabus.html\"> \nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~taylor/ics127/syllabus.html</a>. Announcements concerning \nassignments will be made there, changes to the lecture schedule will be announced \nthere, and so on. \n<hr>\n<a name=\"Teams\"></a>\n<h1> Teams and Meetings </h1>\n<p> Meetings are an important part of a team project. A successful meeting requires \n  that the meeting have a definite purpose and associated agenda (these are the \n  responsibility of the phase manager) and that all decisions be recorded in minutes \n  (the responsibility of the phase clerical person). \n<p> The purpose of minutes is to record decisions made and to be available for \n  updating any team member who misses a meeting. Each deliverable must be accompanied \n  by agendas and minutes for the team meetings held during the associated period \n  of time. I.e., keep the agenda, and the minutes, on-line as part of your project \n  web page. The minutes should outline \n<ol>\n  <li> agenda for the meeting \n  <li> team members present and reason for any member's absence \n  <li> major design decisions discussed \n  <li> task assignments made \n  <li> future meetings scheduled \n</ol>\n<p>As noted earlier, teams will use (at least) the discussion sections for team \n  meetings. <a name=\"teams\"></a> \n<TABLE BORDER CELLPADDING=2>\n  <TR> \n    <td>\n    <strong>Team Designator \n    <td> \n    <Strong>Home page \n    <td><strong>Customer Contact </STRONG>\n    <td><strong> Office </strong>\n    </strong></strong></tr>\n  <TR> \n    <td>TBD \n    <td> TBD\n    <td> TBD \n    <TD> TBD\n  </tr>\n  <TR>\n    <td>&nbsp;\n    <td>&nbsp;\n    <td>&nbsp;\n    <TD>&nbsp;\n  </tr>\n</table>   \n\n\n\n<HR>\n<a name=\"computing\"></a>\n<H1> Computing </H1>\n\nTo facilitate sharing of files among team members, each team will have\nan account on a Unix (Sun Solaris 2) machine, where the team web site\nand project documents must be maintained.\n\n<p>The primary computing facilities will be the <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab\">ICS Labs</a>, which provide Sun\nSolaris and Windows/NT machines.&nbsp; The <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/about/hardware.html\">hardware\nenvironment</a> and <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/about/software.html\">software\nenvironment</a> is posted on the lab's web site as well as the <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/hours.html\">lab hours</a> and\navailability for Fall 1999.\n\n<p>The system specification for each deliverable may be done on Suns, Macintoshes,\nPCs, or any other available platform. Choice of computing platform for\nimplementation will depend on the projects chosen. Where possible and reasonable,\nJava will be the implementation language used. (Scads of Java information\nis available on-line, including a <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/tutorial/index.html\">tutorial,\n</a><a href=\"ftp://ftp.javasoft.com/docs/javaspec.ps.zip\">reference\nmaterial\n</a>and many, many packages, such as those available from <a href=\"http://www-b.gamelan.com/index.\nshtml\">Gamelan</a>.)\n\n<p>\nChoice of computing platforms will depend on the projects chosen.
