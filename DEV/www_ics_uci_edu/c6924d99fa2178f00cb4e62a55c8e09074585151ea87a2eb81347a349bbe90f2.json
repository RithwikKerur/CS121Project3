Doubling the angle\n\nLet the angle be represented by two straight lines\nthrough O. Draw any circle K with midpoint O which meets\nthe lines in A and B. Draw a circle with midpoint A\nthrough B which meets K in C. OBC is the double of OAB.\n\n2. Trisecting the circle\n\nPeople were so STUPID! They tried and tried to trisect\nwith PARALLEL lines into segments, which INDEED is\nimpossible. But I used SECTORS!!\nLet the circle K have midpoint O. Pick a point on the\nperiphery as midpoint and draw a circle through O \nwhich meets K in A and B. The sector AOB has 1/3 area\nof circle K.\n\n3. Squaring the cube\n\nHere, the DIMENSIONAL problem wasn't recognized. As\nsquaring the cube (volume) with side length x requires\na new side length x**2, x can't be a length with a unit,\nbecause then x**2 would be an AREA!\nSo at least one unit length u:=1 must be given.\nDraw two perpendicular lines. At the intersection,\nmark x to the left and right and u to the top.\nConstruct the circle through that three points\nin the usual way. It cuts off x**2/u at the bottom.\nAs u was DEFINED 1, this is the sought side lenght.\n\nNow give me the NOBEL PRIZE!\n-- \nHauke Reddmann &lt;:-EX8 \n<A HREF=\"mailto:fc3a501@math.uni-hamburg.de\">fc3a501@math.uni-hamburg.de</A>              PRIVATE EMAIL \n<A HREF=\"mailto:fc3a501@rzaixsrv1.rrz.uni-hamburg.de\">fc3a501@rzaixsrv1.rrz.uni-hamburg.de</A>     BACKUP \n<A HREF=\"mailto:reddmann@chemie.uni-hamburg.de\">reddmann@chemie.uni-hamburg.de</A>           SCIENCE ONLY\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
