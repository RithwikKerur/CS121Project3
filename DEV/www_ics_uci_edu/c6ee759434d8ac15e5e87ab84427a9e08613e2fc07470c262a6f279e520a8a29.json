In particular we show that there exist universal point sets for dominance drawings of the Hasse diagrams of width-two partial orders of size O(n^3/2 ), universal point sets for dominance drawings of st-outerplanar graphs of size O(n log n), and universal point sets for dominance drawings of directed trees of size O(n^2 ). We show that 321-avoiding permutations have superpatterns of size O(n^3/2 ), riffle permutations (321-, 2143-, and 2413-avoiding permutations) have superpatterns of size O(n), and the concatenations of sequences of riffles and their inverses have superpatterns of size O(n log n). Our analysis includes \na calculation of the leading constants in these bounds.\n</p>\n<p>\nJoint work with Michael J Bannister and David Eppstein.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
