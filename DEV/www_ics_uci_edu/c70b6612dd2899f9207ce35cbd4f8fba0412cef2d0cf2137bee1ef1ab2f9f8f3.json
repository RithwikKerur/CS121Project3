The mailing list is the final\narbiter of consensus on any issue.  Note also, that the revised\nRedirect References protocol produced as a result of this conference\ncall will also be subject to review by the mailing list. ***\n\nIssue #16: We accept the proposed language.  There is no way we can\nguarantee that redirect references will be easy to implement for all\nimplementations.\n\nIssue #17: There is a need for both the Location header, which alway\nreturns an absolute URL, and some means of getting the actual value of\nthe Redirect Target, which can be a relative URL.  This is why just\nusing the Location header to retrieve this value is insufficient,\nsince it cannot return a relative URL.  We will eed some mechanism\n(REFGET method?) for retrieving the relative URL value.\n\nIssue #18: Agreed that we should not create a registration procedure\nfor resource types.  New resource types are not created that often,\nand need to be defined by an RFC, and are not expected to be created\nby end-users.  However, we agree that this should be listed in the\nIANA considerations section.  Of course, in general, there is a need\nfor registration proceedures for new HTTP methods, headers, as well as\nfor DAV properties.\n\nIssue #19: Agree that the language needs to be changed, and we will\nrevise it.\n\nIssue #20: Disagree.  We are creating a document that will be used for\nmany years, and 5-10 years from now, MKRESOURCE will not be a \"new\"\nmethod. But, we will add language stating that the method is defined\nnormatively in this document.\n\nIssue #21: It is an oversight that these sentences are still\npresent. They will be removed. Everything except for the first\nsentence of the paragraph can be deleted.\n\nIssue #23: There most frequently used HTTP clients do not display the\nresponse body on a redirect, and thus it doesn't seem to make much\nsense to provide remote authoring capability for this.  However, it is\na SHOULD level requirement in HTTP/1.1 that a 302 return a body that\nmight be displayed. There are 4 cases here: GET, GET with Apply-to-RR,\nPUT, PUT with Apply-to-RR.  GET needs to be able to return a body, due\nto HTTP/1.1 requirements.  GET with Apply-to-RR we feel should fail\n(403 or 405). PUT should fail, as should PUT with Apply-to-RR.\n\nIssue #26: Will take this under advisement when we revise this\nsection.\n\nIssue #27: Will evaluate this in its use cases to see if it clarifies\nthe language.\n\nIssue #28: Agreed.  Will change the language to reflect this.\n\nIssue #29: Agreed that it is obvious.  Will remove it.\n\nIssue #30: Will keep up to \"MUST be returned\", then remove the rest of\nthe sentence.\n\nIssue #31: Agreed that this section can be removed, it does list\nobvious consequences.\n\nIssue #32: Agreed that we will remove the mention of ORDERPATCH.\n\nIssue #33: Agreed, will replace \"forward\" with \"redirect\" throughout\nwhere it is appropriate.\n\nIssue #34: Agreed, we will remove all references to bindings from this\nspecification.\n\nIssue #35: Agreed to remove these paragraphs (this is a consequence of\nresolution to Issue #34).\n\nIssue #36: We will re-write the specification to remove the use of the\nterm \"server\" as much as possible.\n\nIssue #37: The key issue is that the target value is completely under\nthe control of the client, the server must not modify the value of the\nredirect reference.  We will rewrite the integrity statement to say\nthis instead.\n\nIssue #38: We will rewrite this to retain the motivation of having\nsomething in a collection by-reference, but remove discussion of\nhierarchy. But, should motivate the HTTP/1.1 uses of redirect\nreferences first, then go on to WebDAV motivations later in the\nintroduction.\n\nIssue #39: Already agreed to do this in issue #15 resolution.\n\nIssue #40: Will remove word server.  We will look at uses of \"forward\"\nin this section to see if they should be \"redirect\".  Will also remove\ndiscussion of direct reference resources in this section.Will mention\nthe difference between the definition of \"forward\" and \"redirect\" in\nthe spec (perhaps in this section).\n\nIssue #43: Went back on our discussion of last week, and agreed that\nwe would like to have a DAV:Reftarget property available for WebDAV\ncompliant servers. This would allow a client to quickly retrieve the\nReftargets of all Redirect Reference resources in a particular\ncollection. This property would, of course, not be available for\nHTTP/1.1 only servers.\n\nIssue #44: Did not find arguments against the current marshalling to\nbe compelling, will keep this as-is.  There do not appear, in general,\nto be compelling reasons to choose one marshalling over another.\n\nIssue #45: We found the note to be incorrect.  A request on a redirect\nreference resource with the Apply-to-RR header must behave according\nto the specification, and hence by definition there is no case where\nyou can receive a 302 back without following the behavior of the\nspec. So, we will not include the proposed note.\n\nIssue #46: We have agreed to remove all references to bindings from\nthis specification.\n\nIssue #47: The comment about 207 no longer applies, since MKRESOURCE\nhas been replaced with MKREF. Will add to the text of the 409 response\nto note that some of the conditions only apply to WebDAV collection\ncases.\n\nIssue #48: Agreed that most of the text in Section 6 can be removed.\nWill provisionally accept Yaron's text (excepting the word \"blindly\").\nWill keep the requirements about the Redirect-Ref and Location header\nbeing (relative|absolute) and absolute URLs respectively.\n\n*** End of teleconference ***", "encoding": "ascii"}
