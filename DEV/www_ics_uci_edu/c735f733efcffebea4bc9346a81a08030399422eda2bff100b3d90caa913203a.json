What can you say about the worst-case time for algorithm A?</p>\n<p><i>Hint: use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov's_inequality\">Markov's inequality</a>.</i></p></li>\n\n<li>[Mitzenmacher and Upfal 3.21]<p>Let <i>p</i> be a random permutation of <i>n</i> items, with all permutations equally likely. What is the probability that item <i>i</i> is mapped to itself by permutation <i>p</i>?\nUse your answer and linearity of expectation to compute <i>E</i>[<i>X</i>] where <i>X</i> is the number of items that are mapped to themselves.</li>\n\n<li><p>Define a graph to be \"tight\" if every two vertices are either\nadjacent or connected by a path of length two (or both). We wish to find\nthe threshold probability that determines whether a random graph is\ntight.</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><p>In the <i>G</i>(<i>n</i>,<i>p</i>) model of random graphs,\nwhat is the probability that a given pair of vertices are not\ntight?</p></li>\n<li><p>Approximately how large does <i>p</i> need to be to ensure that\nwith constant probability the whole graph is tight? (Apply Markov's\ninequality to the expected number of non-tight pairs.)</p></li>\n<li><p>What is the expected number of edges in a random graph with this probability?</p></ol></li>\n\n<li><p>We saw in class that if <i>n</i> balls each choose the less full\nof two random bins, from a set of <i>B</i> bins, then:</p>\n<ul><li>If <i>n</i> is much smaller than &radic;<i>B</i> then with high\nprobability each bin will have at most one ball (the birthday paradox),\nand</li>\n<li>if <i>n</i> and <i>B</i> are approximately equal, then with high probability the most full bin will have <i>O</i>(log&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>) balls (the power of two choices).</li></ul><p>The aim of this problem is to interpolate between those two results.</p>\n<p>Recall the following facts:</p>\n<ul><li>For <i>n</i> smaller than a constant times <i>B</i>,\neach connected component of the random graph <i>G</i> whose vertices are\nbins and whose edges are the pairs of cells for each ball is (with high\nprobability) either a tree or a tree-plus-one-edge.</li>\n<li>When the <i>i</i>th ball lands in a bin, and that bin belongs to a\ncomponent that is either a tree or a tree-plus-one-edge, we can find a\ncomplete binary tree of height&nbsp;<i>i</i> on the balls in that\ncomponent, showing that <i>i</i> is at most logarithmic in the size of\nthe component.</ul>\n<p>Now suppose that <i>n</i> is significantly smaller\nthan <i>B</i>. Calculate (in terms of <i>n</i> and <i>B</i>) the\nexpected number of components of <i>G</i> that have at least one edge,\nthe expected number of components that have at least two edges, etc. Use\nMarkov's inequality to find the maximum value <i>c</i> such that there\nis constant probability of having a component of size at\nleast <i>c</i>. What does this bound on component size, together with\nthe complete binary tree argument, imply about the maximum number of\nballs per bin?</p></li>\n</ol>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
