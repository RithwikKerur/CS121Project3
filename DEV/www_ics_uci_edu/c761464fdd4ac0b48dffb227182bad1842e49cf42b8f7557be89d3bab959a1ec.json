I will discuss some previously known results about\nuniversal point sets.  Then I will present a new construction based on\n213-superpatterns that gives a factor of two improvement over\ncurrently known upper bounds on the size of universal point sets. This\nis joint work with Bannister, Devanny, and Eppstein.\n\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
