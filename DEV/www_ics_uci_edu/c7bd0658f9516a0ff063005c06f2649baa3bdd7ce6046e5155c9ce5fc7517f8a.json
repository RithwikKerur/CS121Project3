Most of you are creators of web content in some form. Many of you will enter careers where you will specify or manage the presentation of information on the web. Yet few people have a concrete understanding of what makes some web sites more successful than \nothers&mdash;more navigable, more comprehensible, easier to develop and maintain, less frustrating, less error-prone. This course will focus on the principles of human-computer interaction (HCI) as they apply to the design, development, and evaluation of web sites.</P>\n<P>This course is not a course in implementation tools or skills. If you know how to use Dreamweaver or HTML, that's great, but it's not expected or required for your work in this class. We will concentrate on usability&mdash;how to evaluate the effectiveness of web sites and how to design them to be more effective. This is what you need to do (and what too many websites neglect) <em>before</em> you start writing HTML.</P>\n<P><B>Prerequisite courses and concepts:</B>\n This course was designed for majors outside of the School of Information and Computer Sciences; it has no academic prerequisites. We do expect each student to be able to write clear, cogent,\ngrammatical English;  much of the work\nin this course will involve describing and justifying the design decisions\nand evaluation judgements you make.  We also expect you to have these basic\ncomputing skills:  Searching and browsing the Web, reading and sending Email,\ndownloading files, viewing and printing PDF (Adobe Acrobat) documents, and\ncreating or saving documents for Email and other purposes in plain (ASCII)\ntext form (not HTML or Word attachments). If you need to brush up on any of these, let us know and we'll help. </P>\n<P>\n<strong>Curricular connections:</strong> This course satisfies General Education category II (Science and Technology). If you're a major in the School of ICS (ICS, CS, CSE, BIM, Informatics) you should strongly consider taking Informatics 131 instead of this course, because Informatics 131 covers the field of HCI more broadly. Its prerequisite is any single course in computing (such as ICS 10 or ICS 31); it meets Tuesdays and Thurdays from 2:00 to 3:20 in room SSL 228 (and at last report there were seats available).</P>\n<P><B>Meeting place and times:</B>  Lecture meets\n  Tuesdays and Thursdays from 11:00 to 12:20 in room 1600 DBH.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Office hours:</B>  You are welcome to drop by my office at any time. If I'm there and not immersed in something else, I'll be glad to chat about the course or other topics. \n<!-- In particular, I will try to be available most days right after class, so let me know before we leave the classroom that you'd like to meet. -->\nI will definitely be in or near\nmy office during these scheduled hours, when course-related matters\nwill have first priority:  <FONT >Tuesdays from 12:30 to 1:15 and Thursdays from 2:00 to 2:30</FONT>.  Of course emergencies may come\nup, but I will try to give advance notice of any change.\n\n  I&#39;ll also be\nhappy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't skip it without getting in touch).  The quickest\nand most effective way to reach me outside of class is by electronic mail (see below).</P>\n<P>\n<B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can\nusually get a response to your course-related questions within a few hours\n(perhaps a bit longer on the weekends) by sending electronic mail to the\naddress <A HREF=\"mailto:kay@uci.edu\"><code>ics4@uci.edu</code></A>. We will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam filters snag a legitimate message.  Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet Email address will help your messages get noticed.\n</P>\n<P>The <A HREF=\"mailto:kay@uci.edu\"><code>ics4@uci.edu</code></A> Email address is private between you and me and the TAs. We have also set up a more public discussion forum at <code><a href=\"http://www.piazza.com/uci/winter2013/ics4/home\">www.piazza.com</a></code>.  Piazza has some advantages over the typical noteboard or discussion group; we'll use it this term and analyze its usability, too.</P>\n<P>\nWe will send official course announcements by Email\nto the EEE course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.\n Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar\nhas for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your Email on another\naccount, you should set your UCInet account to forward your Email to your\npreferred account (you can do this on the web at \n<A HREF=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html\"><code>http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html</code></A>.\n Don&#39;t let this slide; if you miss official announcements, your grade\ncould suffer.  This course has a home page at <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/4/\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/4/</code></A>; an archive of official course Email is at <A HREF=\"http://e3.uci.edu/132w/w3m3/36500\"><code>http://e3.uci.edu/13w/w3m3/36500</code></a>.</P>\n<P>\n  <B>Textbook and course materials:</B>  \n  <BR />\nOur official textbook is <I><a href=\"http://www.prenhall.com/mccracken_wolfe/students/index.html\">User-Centered Website Development</a>: A Human-Computer Interaction Approach,</I> by Dan McCracken and Rosalee Wolfe.\nIf you have a background in coding with HTML and CSS, you may prefer this as an alternative:  <i><a href=\"http://headfirstlabs.com/books/hfwd/\">Head First Web Design</a></i> by Ethan Watrall and Jeff Siarto; it \ncovers the same main concepts but with an engaging style and a focus on implementation.</P>\n<P>We may assign other readings as the course goes on.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Course structure:\n<BR />\n</B><I><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/4/hw/index.html\">Assignments</A></I>\n(40% of the course grade, with later assignments generally weighted more\nheavily than earlier ones)\n<BR />\n<I>Class participation</I> (15%, including coming to class, participating in discussions and in-class activities, and being active on Piazza)\n<BR />\n<I>One midterm,</I> given in class on Thursday, February 7 (15%)\n<BR />\n<I>One final exam,</I> on Tuesday, March 19, from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (30%)</P>\n<P> We assign final letter grades neither on a fixed-point scale nor on a formal curve (with equal numbers of As and Fs, for example). Your scores on assignments and exams will be recorded in the EEE Gradebook, which indicates where they fall among everyone else's scores; if you find yourself consistently in the bottom quarter, check with the instructor.\n</P>\n<P>\nWe&#39;re required to say that in unusual\ncircumstances, these criteria could change, but we do not expect that to\nhappen.</P>\n<P><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the instructor at any time. </P>\n<P>\n<B>What you must do right now to get started\nin ICS 4:</B>\n<BR />\n&mdash; If you do not have a UCInet ID,\nget one.  See <A HREF=\"https://activate.uci.edu/\"><code>https://activate.uci.edu</code></A>.\n<BR />\n&mdash; If you prefer to read your electronic mail on an account other than your\nUCInet account, redirect your mail at <A HREF=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html\"><code>http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/deliverypoint.html</code></A>.<BR />\n&mdash; Complete the <a href=\"http://eee.uci.edu/survey/ics4winter13\">ICS 4 Questionnaire</a> at <code>http://eee.uci.edu/survey/ics4winter13</code> (by Friday afternoon of the first week).<br />\n&mdash; Go to <a href=\"http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/\">checkmate.ics.uci.edu</a>, log in with your UCInet ID, choose &quot;Course Listing&quot; and Winter 2013, click &quot;Go&quot; next to ICS 4, and then click &quot;List me for this course.&quot; You'll submit most of your work electronically; this step is necessary to set that up.<BR />\n&mdash; Go to <a href=\"https://piazza.com/uci/winter2013/ics4\">www.piazza.com</a> and follow the steps to add yourself as a student in this course.  <BR />\n&mdash; If you aren&#39;t yet officially enrolled in the course, you're welcome to wait to see if some spaces open up. We can't take more students than the room will hold (for fire safety reasons), however, and it's not likely they can find us a larger room.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Good advice and helpful hints:</B></P>\n<P>\nCheck your electronic mail regularly; this\nis an official channel for course announcements. When sending course-related mail, start the subject line with &quot;ICS 4&quot; or &quot;Web HCI class&quot;.</P>\n<P>\nAttendance in class is essential; concepts\nand issues that come up in class will find their way onto the exams and\nclass participation in various forms counts towards the course grade.</P>\n<P>\nAlways keep your own copy of each assignment,\nboth electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\nshuffle (due to human or machine error), we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily.</P>\n<P>\nIf you find yourself having trouble or getting\nbehind, speak with the instructor.  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut\nof copying someone else&#39;s work and turning it in; the consequences can\nbe far worse than just a low score on one assignment.
