This type\r\nof unethical behavior would be difficult to spot, although the damage would eventually accumulate. By misrepresenting\r\nyour knowledge you are fooling yourself. At some point you may find that computer science is inappropriate for\r\nyou - then you will have wasted many years. Also employers will recognize your lack of ability and that is unlikely\r\nto make you very happy.</SPAN>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n\r\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
