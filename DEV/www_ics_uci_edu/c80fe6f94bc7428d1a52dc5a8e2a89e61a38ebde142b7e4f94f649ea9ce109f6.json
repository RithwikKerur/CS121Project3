If the data may not be destroyed pursuant to the Archives Act, the\nDirector General of the National Archives of Norway shall be consulted prior to\nmaking an administrative decision regarding erasure. This decision shall take\nprecedence over the provisions of sections 9 and 18 of the Archives Act of 4\nDecember 1992 No. 126. </P>\n<P>Erasure should be supplemented by the recording of accurate and complete\ndata. If this is impossible, and the document which contained the erased data\ntherefore provides a clearly misleading picture, the entire document shall be\nerased. </P>\n<P>The King may prescribe regulations containing supplementary provisions as\nregards how to effect rectification. </P>\n<H4><a name=\"sec28\"></a>Section 28 Prohibition against storing unnecessary personal data </H4>\n<P>The controller shall not store personal data longer than is necessary to\ncarry out the purpose of the processing. If the personal data shall not\nthereafter be stored in pursuance of the Archives Act or other legislation,\nthey shall be erased. </P>\n<P>The controller may, notwithstanding the first paragraph, store personal data\nfor historical, statistical or scientific purposes, if the public interest in\nthe data being stored clearly exceeds the disadvantages this may entail for the\nperson concerned. In this case, the controller shall ensure that the data are\nnot stored in ways which make it possible to identify the data subject longer\nthan necessary. </P>\n<P><a name=\"sec28-1\"></a>The data subject may demand that data which are strongly disadvantageous to\nhim or her shall be blocked or erased if this <BR>\na) is not contrary to another statute, and <BR>\nb) is justifiable on the basis of an overall assessment of, inter alia the\nneeds of other persons for documentation, the interests of the data subject,\ncultural historical interests and the resources required to carry out the\ndemand. </P>\n<P>After the Director General of the National Archives of Norway has been\nconsulted, the Data Inspectorate may decide that the right to erase data\npursuant to the third paragraph shall take precedence over the provisions of\nsections 9 and 18 of the Archives Act of 4 December 1992 No. 126. </P>\n<P>If the document which contained the erased data gives a clearly misleading\npicture after the erasure, the entire document shall be erased. </P>\n<H4><A HREF=\"#topp\"><IMG SRC=\"../../buttons/navpilop.gif\"\nALT=\"{short description of image}\" WIDTH=\"16\" HEIGHT=\"16\" BORDER=\"0\"></A><A\nNAME=\"ch5\"></A>Chapter V Transfer of personal data to other countries</H4>\n<H4>Section 29 Basic conditions </H4>\n<P>Personal data may only be transferred to countries which ensure an adequate\nlevel of protection of the data.
