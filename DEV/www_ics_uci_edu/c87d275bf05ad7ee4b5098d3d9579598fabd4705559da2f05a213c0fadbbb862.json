However,\r\nwhen a person name is queried, the returned webpages often contain documents related to several distinct namesakes\r\nwho have the queried name. The task of disambiguating and finding the webpages related to the specific person of inter \r\nest is left to the user. Many Web People Search (WePS) approaches have been developed recently that attempt to\r\nautomate this disambiguation process. Nevertheless, the disambiguation quality of these techniques leaves a major\r\nroom for improvement. This paper presents a new server-side WePS approach. It is based on collecting co-occurrence\r\ninformation from the Web and thus it uses the Web as an external data source. A skyline-based classification technique\r\nis developed for classifying the collected co-occurrence information in order to make clustering decisions. \r\nThe clustering technique is specifically designed to (a) handle the dominance that exists in data and \r\n(b) to adapt to a given clustering quality measure. These properties allow the framework\r\nto get a major advantage in terms of result quality over all the latest WePS techniques we are aware of, including all\r\nthe 18 methods covered in the recent WePS competition [2].\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Categories and Subject Descriptors:</H3>\r\nH.2.m [<B>Database Management</B>]: Miscellaneous - Web People Search;<BR>\r\nH.2.8 [<B>Database Management</B>]: Database Applications - Data mining;<BR>\r\nH.3.3 [<B>Information Storage and Retrieval</B>]: Information Search and Retrieval<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<H3>Keywords:</H3>\r\nWeb People Search, WEPS, clustering,\r\nSkyline Based Classifier,\r\nWeb co-occurrence,\r\nEntity Resolution,\r\nDisambiguation,\r\nServer-side approach\r\n</p>\r\n<BR>\r\n<p>\r\n<H3>Downloadable files:</H3>\r\nPaper: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/SIGIR08_dvk.pdf\">SIGIR08_dvk.pdf</A><BR>\r\nPresentation: <A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/pub/SIGIR08_dvk.ppt\">SIGIR08_dvk.ppt</A><BR>\r\n<IMG SRC=\"https://students.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/fig.cgi?SIGIR08_dvk\" width=1 height=1>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<H3>BibTeX entry:</H3>\r\n<pre>@inproceedings{SIGIR08::dvk,\r\n   author    = {Dmitri V.\\ Kalashnikov and Rabia Nuray-Turan and Sharad Mehrotra},\r\n   title     = {Towards Breaking the Quality Curse. {A} Web-Querying Approach to {Web People Search}},\r\n   booktitle = {Proc.\\ of Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference},\r\n   year      = {2008},\r\n   month     = {July 20--24},\r\n   address   = {Singapore}\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n<A href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dvk/index.html\">Back to Kalashnikov's homepage </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n<BR>\r\n</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
