It was good talking with you.\r\nI hope that we can determine one way or another if we have a common branch\r\nin our family trees. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe piece of information that started my quest for information about\r\nElimelech of Dynow was that Rabbi Kreiswirth, in a letter to another Polimer\r\ndescendent, said that his ancestor, Moshe Yossef Polimer, had a wife who was\r\na granddaughter of Elimelech of Dynow. We know that Moshe Yossef Polimer was\r\nmarried twice, once to Miriam, who had previously been married to Samuel\r\nKahlman Warfield, and earlier to a woman whose name is unknown. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to that information, this is what I know:\r\n\r\n\r\n1)      My great-great-grandfather was Isaac Polimer. According to the death\r\ncertificate of one of his children, Isaac was from Hlomcza, Austria.\r\n2)      Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth's great-great-grandfather (his mother's\r\nmother's mother's father) was Moshe Yossef Polimer. According to the Rabbi,\r\nhe was a farmer from (my interpretation of what he said, followed by some\r\nserious map searching) \"Siedlce or Siedlec\" Galicia.\r\n3)      According to his USA arrival passenger ship manifest, the son of\r\nMoshe Yossef indicated that he was from Zadownicki, Austria.\r\n4)      There was also Jacob Polimer whose son, Menashe, settled in Boston.\r\nAccording to Menashe's death certificate, he was from Austria. Jacob was the\r\ngreat-great-grandfather of Sueellen Goodman.\r\n5)      Several years ago, I asked Rabbi Kreiswirth if he knew the\r\nrelationship between Isaac, Moshe, and Jacob. He told me that they were\r\nbrothers.\r\n6)      However, some family tree charts that were prepared back in the\r\n1930's by a descendent of Moshe showed boxes and lines that could be\r\ninterpreted to mean that Moshe was the FATHER of Isaac and Jacob, and not\r\ntheir brother. It is interesting to note that on those charts, the name was\r\nanglicized as \"Moses Joseph\". I have always assumed that Rabbi Kreiswirth\r\nhad better information, as he was very seriously researching this Polimer\r\nfamily history back in the 1950's and 1960's.\r\n7)      Rabbi Kreiswirth was not able to provide any information about the\r\nparents of Isaac/Jacob/Moshe Polimer.\r\n8)      There is some confusion about the last names on Rabbi Kreiswirth's\r\npaternal side. In a responsa he wrote, he mentions that his father was Rabbi\r\nAbraham Yosef Rapaport from Magnishov. However, other reliable sources\r\nindicate that his parents were Abraham Yosef Sherman and \"? Rapaport\".\r\nAbraham Yosef may have taken his wife's name, as her ancestorial line goes\r\nto Chaim HaKoen (HaMechaber) Rappoport.\r\n9)      Rabbi Kreiswirth's mother's parents were Rabbi Aaron Kreiswirth and\r\nEsther Fisch. Esther's grandfather was Moshe Yossef Polimer.\r\n10)     Rabbi Kreiswirth's wife, Sarah Grodzinsky, is the daughter of Rabbi\r\nAbraham Grodzinsky, Dean of the Slobodka Yeshiva (where Rabbi Kreiswirth\r\nwent). Sarah's mother, Chasya Gisseh Heller, is the daughter of Rabbi DovBer\r\nHirsch.\r\n11)     Rabbi Kreiswirth's son is Rabbi Dov Zvi Kreiswirth of Lakewood, NJ.\r\n12)     Rabbi Kreiswirth's daughter Penina is married to Rabbi Pincus\r\nZelivansky of Jerusalem, whose lineage is traced back to Joseph Treves, ABD\r\nof Paris, born about 1300 (in \"The Unbroken Chain\"). His grandfather was\r\nRabbi Aryeh Shapiro from Bialystok who was the son of Rabbi Refoel of\r\nVolozhin who was the son in law of the Netziv of Volozhin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION:\r\nRabbi Chaim Kreiswirth\r\nQuiten Matsijslei 34    \r\n2018 Anterwerpen Belgium        \r\nPhone 3-233-5567\r\n\r\n\r\nRabbi Dov Zvi Kreiswirth\r\nLakewood, NJ\r\n\r\n\r\nPenina Zelivansky\r\nSorotzkin Street 41\r\nJerusalem, Israel\r\nemail = Zahava126@aol.com\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Henri Rosenberg \r\n(creator of a massive website about Rabbi Chaim Kreiswirth) \r\nhttp://www.moronhoravkreiswirth.org\r\nhrosenberg@lawyer-a1.com\r\nPresident@goedkosjer.org\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we discussed, I will ask Henri Rosenberg to speak to Rabbi Chaim\r\nKreiswirth about his connection to Elimelech of Dynow.

I spoke with R' Kreizwirth myself three times\r\ntoday. He explained his relationship to the Spira family. His connection is\r\nvia R' Yakov Uri, ABD Turka, who was a son-in-law to R' Hersh Mylech (Tzvi\r\nElimelech) Spira through R' Yakov Uri's first marriage. R' Yakov Uri was a\r\ngrand-son-in-law via his second marriage. R' Yakov Uri's first wife, Rivka\r\nSpira, died young. His second wife, Yitta Leah Schonfeld, was a daughter of\r\nSara Spira (and Moshe Schonfeld). Sara was an older sister of Rivka.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyhow, in my existing tree, I have the oldest child of R' Yakov Uri's\r\nfirst marriage as Henya, married to a Eliyahu (Elias) Fisch. In your tree,\r\nyou have Hanna Polimer married to Eliyahu Fisch. So we are close, but\r\nobviously not in sync. I have no idea what is correct. The only thing I can\r\ntell you is that Rivka died in the 1830's and had four children. This makes\r\nher eligible to marry either generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCan you send me a gedcom of the Moshe Yosef Polimer family (from him to\r\ncurrent day)? I have FTM 5.0b.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\n-Moishe\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Weiner, Joel A.\" &lt;Joel.Weiner@jhuapl.edu> \r\nTo: 'Moishe Miller' \r\nCc: goodman@gwi.net, moishe@langsam.com \r\nSubject: RE: Spoke w/ R' Kreiswirth \r\nDate: Fri, 27 Apr 2001 09:36:54 -0400 \r\n\r\n\r\nMoishe-\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it is great that you were able to call Rabbi Kreiswirth and speak\r\nwith him three times!

I then printed out a \r\n<a href=\"krswrth.gif\">chart</a> from Rabbi Hersch Mylech Spira (Tzvi \r\nElimelech) to Rabbi Kreiswirth's parents, for the purpose of looking \r\nat the dates given for births and deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nI deleted any branches of the tree that were unnecessary for this analysis,\r\nand then saved the chart. It is attached as a jpg file, MS Word document,\r\nand <a href=\"krswrth.gif\">gif file</a>. Please open and print one of them \r\nso that you can follow what I say below.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, and a minor, problem is that Moishe says in his message of April 26\r\nthat Rivka Spira \"died in the 1830's.\" However, in the data he sent on April\r\n27, it shows her passing in 1841. This does not really make any difference\r\nin the following consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy chart shows Samuel Kalman Polmer and his sister Rosalyn \"Rose\" Polmer\r\nboth being born 1860/61. Their father, Napthali, is shown born \"about 1840\"\r\nwhich would make him about 20 years old when they were born. So far, that\r\nmakes sense. He could have been a few years younger than 20 when Samuel and\r\nRosalyn were born, perhaps 17. So that would make it possible for his birth\r\nyear to have been about 1843.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, if Napthali was born about 1840 - 1843, then his mother (Henya Uri\r\nPolimer, as shown in the chart) would need to have been born about 1823 -\r\n1826 or earlier. I calculate this assuming that she would have been at least\r\n17 when she had her first child (Napthali). This is a reasonable guess, but\r\na first child at 15 or 16 is not unheard of. But if Henya was 17 in 1840 -\r\n1843, then she would have born 1823 - 1826. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf the above two paragraphs are true, then we have a problem with Rabbi\r\nYakov Uri being Henya's father, as he was born 1810, and would have been 13\r\n- 16 when Henya was born in 1823 - 1826. If Henya or Napthali were older\r\nthan about 17 when either had their first child, then that makes Rabbi Uri\r\neven younger!\r\n\r\n\r\nSo either Rabbi Yakov Uri, Henya Uri, and Napthali Polmer ALL had children\r\nat a very young age (17 or less), or else the marriage we have \"created\"\r\nbetween Henya Uri and Moshe Yosef Polimer must be questioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone have any thoughts or suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\nJoel\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Mon, 30 Apr 2001 22:15:25 -0400\r\nTo: \"Weiner, Joel A.\" &lt;Joel.Weiner@jhuapl.edu>,  \"'President@goedkosjer.org'\" \r\n\t<President@goedkosjer.org>,  \"'AdrienneSher@msn.com'\" &lt;AdrienneSher@msn.com>,  \r\n\t\"'AHSHER@ex-pressnet.com'\" &lt;AHSHER@ex-pressnet.com>\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Confusion in Rabbi Yakov Uri to Kreiswirth/Polimer lineage\r\n\r\nDear All,\r\n\r\nLet me shed light on what I know. Regarding the 1841 issue, Joel, you noted \r\na limitation in Family Tree Maker (at least in version 5). In the Outline \r\nview it improperly translates \"before 1841\" as 1841. I quoted to you 1830's \r\n(rather than \"before 1841\") because that is most likely, given R' yakov Uri's \r\nsubsequent marriage and the number of children he had, although it could have \r\nbeen as late as 1840 itself.\r\n\r\nI agree with your synopsis regarding the tightness of the dates. While it is \r\npossible that there are errors (I have no eye witness accounts of course), I \r\nrely somewhat on the ancillary families for proof. Henya's younger sister, \r\nRochel Leah, had a son Shalom, born 1861. This is an even tighter timetable \r\nthan you presented. Perhaps Henya was even not the oldest. \r\n\r\nHenya was an orphan from her mother by 1840. Her father re-married, so \r\ndepending on who raised her, she may have been without him either. In any \r\nevent, her father, R' Yakov Uri, passed on in 1855. It was common practice \r\nto marry off orphans at a very early age, especially in Rabbinic circles. \r\nBeing grandchildren of the famed personality of R' Hersh Mylech Spira, this \r\nwas potentially an easy task.If it helps, my great-great-grandmother married \r\nwhen she was 14 and gave birth to my g-gf at 16. \r\n\r\nReviewing your own references to the offspring Naftuli Polimer, there is a \r\nnine year gap between Samuel and Leon. There is also a 16 year gap between \r\nSamuel and his wife Stella. Could the 1860 date for Samuel be off by five \r\nor more years? Let me present a scenario:\r\n\r\nChaim Kreiswirth - 1918, son of\r\nPerla Kreiswirth - 1885, dtr of, \r\nEsther Fisch - 1855, dtr of\r\nHannah Polimer - 1838, dtr of\r\nHenya Uri - 1823, dtr of \r\nRivka Uri - 1809, dtr of \r\nR' Hersh Mylech Spira - 1783\r\n\r\nAgain, I agree with Joel's accurate portrayal of this situation. It does give \r\none what to think about and should additional data come to light disproving \r\nthis, nobody would be shocked. With that said, let me just reiterate that this \r\nis the tradition that Rabbi Kreiswirth related to me. It is not impossible. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Rabbi Kreiswirth mentioned that Henya was Moshe Yosef Polimer's \r\nfirst marriage. Looking at the children of his second marriage, you list Augusta \r\n\"Gussie\" Polimer as his second child from his wife Miriam, with a birth date of \r\nJuly 1849. This was Miriam's second marriage too. From that perspective, Hannah \r\nPolimer, eldest child of Moshe Yosef Polimer from a prior marriage, was at least \r\nseveral years older than Augusta \"Gussie\" Polimer. However, under Miriam was \r\nalso married before. Under her FIRST marriage, the one prior to Moshe Yosef \r\nPolimer (with Samuel Kahlman Warfield), you list a child, Riva Warfield, born \r\nin 1853, four years after her half-sister, Gussie, was born. This is not possible. \r\nUnder Jewish law, a woman may not remarry her first husband after having been \r\nmarried again in between, so one of these dates need to be altered slightly. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice to find some documents that could corroborate any of this. I will\r\ncontact Rabbi Kreiswirth and find out where his ancestors passed on, Perhaps death \r\nrecords might give age, although I am sure we all know about the reliability of \r\nthose records. \r\n\r\nSorry for rambling so, your input would be most welcome.\r\n\r\n-Moishe\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nFrom: \"Weiner, Joel A.\" &lt;Joel.Weiner@jhuapl.edu> \r\nTo: \"'moishe@langsam.com'\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com> \r\nSubject: RE: Confusion in Rabbi Yakov Uri to Kreiswirth/Polimer lineage \r\nDate: Tue, 1 May 2001 10:46:22 -0400 \r\nX-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2653.19) \r\n\r\n\r\nMoishe-\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for the enlightening reply. I agree with your rebuttal of my\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\n\r\nI see what you are saying about Augusta 'Gussie' Polimer's birth year being\r\nwrong. The earliest date I can associate with her is her son's wedding in\r\n1894. That would give him a birth year of before 1877, and her a birth year\r\nof before 1860 (assuming he got married at 17 AND she had him at 17).\r\nTherefore, the 1849 seems suspicious. I need to go through my files and find\r\nout who told me she was born in 1849. It was probably a descendant by her\r\nsecond marriage (Arlene Marcia Waldman Laveman), but I don't think she\r\nsupplied any proof.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn looking at the data for Samuel Kalman Polmer, where I show Sep 1 1860/1,\r\nthose dates come from his obituary and from a census report, differing only\r\nin the year. Therefore, I am confident on this. This then puts Napthali\r\nHirsch Polimer's birth year (\"about 1840\") at no later than about 1843.\r\nHowever, I do not see this impacting the \"scenario\" you laid out. The birth\r\nyear for Hannah Polimer you showed as 1838 still works. In fact, you could\r\nmake it 1939, and thereby have the spans between Henya/Hannah and\r\nHannah/Esther each 16 years. That only leaves the birth of Henya occurring\r\nwhen her mother is 14. I think inasmuch as these are all fairly speculative\r\nyears, and can be off by 1-2 minimum, that we should maintain the tree as we\r\nhave it, and hope that something firmer comes up to prove or disprove it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am anxious to learn what you hear from Rabbi Kreiswirth. Keep in touch!\r\n\r\n\r\nJoel\r\n\r\n\r\nPS - I received a <a href=\"chmkrswz.jpg\">nice photo of Rabbi Kreiswirth</a>, and I am attaching it.\r\n\r\n</PRE>\r\n\r\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\r\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\r\n<HR>\r\n<P>\r\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\r\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\r\n<BR>\r\nMy home address is<PRE>\r\n           1374 East 28th Street\r\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\r\n           USA\r\n</PRE>\r\n  \r\n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 1/1/02</FONT>\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n</BODY>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
