The aim of this\npaper is to study the algorithmic complexity of such &ldquo;typical&rdquo;\nnetworks. The contribution of this work is twofold.</p>\n\n<p>First, we define a deterministic condition for checking whether a graph\nhas a power law degree distribution and experimentally validate it on\nreal-world networks. This definition allows us to derive interesting\nproperties of power law networks.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we give a novel theoretical explanation why many algorithms\nrun faster on real-world data than what is predicted by algorithmic\nworst-case analysis. We show how to exploit the power law degree\ndistribution to design faster algorithms for a number of classic\n$\\mathsf{P}$-time\nproblems including transitive closure, maximum matching, determinant,\nPageRank and matrix inverse. Moreover, we deal with the problems of\ncounting triangles and finding maximum clique.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to previously done average-case analyses, we believe that\nthis is the first &ldquo;waterproof&rdquo; argument that explains why many\nreal-world networks are easier.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611974331.ch91\">a\npaper</a> by Pawe&#322; Brach, Marek Cygan, Jakub &#321;&#261;cki, and\nPiotr Sankowski at SODA 2016.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
