The workshop invitees are computer architects and compiler, operating system, and application experts. The main goal of the workshop is to discuss future trends in the development of architecture and software systems and to explore the assumptions made by the architects about software systems and by software writers about architecture. The increased complexity in each of these areas calls for increased interaction with researchers from all of the other disciplines to accurately assess the potential directions and future trends in architecture and systems. </P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The main themes of the workshop are software- and technology-driven and constrained new architectures, compiler/architecture interaction and co-design, and application requirements and characteristics. Both numerical and non-numerical applications, such as database, data mining, Web- and Java-based, and (high-performance) embedded applications, are of interest. In all cases a longer-term view and assessment of the future is of most interest. </P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This year's special focus is custom vs general-purpose processors and systems. Today's processors are increasingly specialized.\nSignificant performance, cost, power, and ease/quality of programming can be achieved if application area requirements and constraints are taken advantage of.  Design, compilation, power management, application area requirements, performance evaluation of such processors and systems and their comparison with general-purpose systems  \nare some of the workshop topics.\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">  Other topics of interest include but are not limited to the following:\n </P>\n\n<UL>\n<LI>Processor design </LI>\n<LI>Single-chip multiprocessors, multi-chip servers and large-scale multiprocessors </LI>\n<LI>Memory technology and system organization </LI>\n<LI>Applications and their performance </LI>\n<LI>Power management</LI>\n<LI>Embedded system design</LI>\n</UL>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The workshop will consist of sessions combining individual presentations with discussion. Presentations will be limited to ~20 min to provide sufficient time for discussion. An ideal presentation will concentrate on trends and future directions in addition to recently obtained results. Speculation is encouraged. </P>\n<B><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Workshop participation is capped at 25 invitees. </P>\n</B><H3><A NAME=\"publ\"></A></H3>\n<B><P>Submission and Publication </P>\n</B><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The invitees wishing to make a presentation should submit an extended abstract, up to 3 pages, by 1/3/04. Submissions should be electronic in postscript or pdf format. The abstracts will be reviewed and printed in the on-site proceedigns. </P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The final proceedings consisting of full papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press after the meeting. The papers will undergo an additional review process and be selected for publication in the post-proceedings. Papers will be due by ~April 1st 2004. <BR>\nThe following set of LaTex <A HREF=\"../ieee.macros\">macros </A>should be used in preparing the final paper. Additional publication instructions will be made available at a later date. </P>\n<I><H3><A NAME=\"people\">Participants </A></H3>\n</I><B><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">USA </P></B>\n<TABLE CELLSPACING=0 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 WIDTH=624>\n<TR><TD WIDTH=\"50%\" VALIGN=\"MIDDLE\" ROWSPAN=3>\n<P>To be announced </TD>\n<TD WIDTH=\"50%\" VALIGN=\"MIDDLE\">\n<P ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"><div align=\"right\" ></TD>\n</TR>\n<TR><TD WIDTH=\"50%\" VALIGN=\"MIDDLE\">\n<P>To be announced </TD>\n</TR>\n<TR><TD WIDTH=\"50%\" VALIGN=\"MIDDLE\">\n<P ALIGN=\"RIGHT\"></div></TD>\n</TR>\n</TABLE>\n\n<!--Japan> </center> </b>\n<br>\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr> <td>\n\t<table align=\"left\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\">\n            <tr>\n                <td>\nTo be announced\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"right\"><div align=\"right\" >\n\t<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"2\">\n            <tr>\n                <td>\nTo be announced\n                </td>\n            </tr>\n        </table>\n\t</div>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<br>\n<br>\n<H3><B> <a name=\"stercom\"> <i> IWIA Steering Committee </i> </a> </B></H3>\n<ul>\nProf. Kazuki Joe <br>\nProf. Alex Nicolau <br>\nProf. Alex Veidenbaum </ul>\n<br>\n<H3><B> <a name=\"travel\"> <i> Travel and Local Arrangements</i> </a> </B></H3>\n<ul>\n<li>\nThere are some non-stop flights from the mainland to Maui Kahului airport and even more flights to Honolulu.\nIn the latter case one has to catch a very short commuter flight from Honolulu to Maui.   <br>\n<li>\nRegistration fee: US$250.00.\n<li>\nWorkshop Hotel\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe workshop hotel is the Maui Prince where we have a group rate for IWIA.\n<li><b> \nReservations must be made by 12/11 </b>  and will require a 2-night deposit (can be cancelled without penalty 72 hours before arrival).\n<li>\nUse this <A HREF=\"http:./reg_form.pdf\"> Registration Form </A> to make hotel reservations\n<li>\nPhone number for reservations is <b> (800)-321-6284 or (808)-956-1111, ext. 56 </b>\n<li>\nThe FAX number for reservations is <b> (808)-944-4491 </b>\n<li>\nIt will be possible to stay for up to 3 extra days at the same rate before and after the meeting.\n<li>\nThe hotel is not near the airport and there is no shuttle service, althought a taxi can get you there..\n</ul>\n<li>\nOther Accomodations: A number of condominiums (1 to 3 bedrooms) are available for those preferring apartment living.
