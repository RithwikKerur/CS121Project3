Below is a list\rof items that should be included in your first deliverable, a project prospectus.\r\r<P>There is no need to select a manager and clerical support for this deliverable\rnor will you be doing performance appraisals at this point. Rather you\rshould use this opportunity to brainstorm and get to know each other.\r\r<HR>\r<H3>\rDue Date</H3>\rAs shown on the course web site.\r\r<HR>\r<H3>\rUnderstanding</H3>\rOne of your major tasks for the current period of time is developing an\runderstanding of the various technologies and tasks concerned with your\rproject. This includes the tools and techniques that you will use in accomplishing\ryour task as well as the technologies that you will be extending, enhancing,\ror changing.\r\r<P>In this deliverable you should reflect your newly gained understanding\rby writing an introduction to your project that highlights its various\rimportant aspects. You should also include a description of activities\rdone in support of developing understanding - like interviews with the\rcustomer, for example. (One of the best ways, of course, to gain an understanding\rof a piece of software is to interview the original developer.)\r<P>\r<HR>\r<H3>\rTechnical Marketing Sheet</H3>\rInclude a one or two page technical marketing sheet (a bit more technical\rthan a \"sales brochure\") suitable for describing your product to a technically\rliterate outside audience. This document should be successful in reflecting\rthat you really understand what problem is being solved and can articulate\rhow your product will add value.\r<P>\r<HR>\r<H3>\rProject Plan</H3>\rUse the outline below in presenting your project plan.\r<UL>\r<LI>\rIntroduction</LI>\r\r<UL>\r<LI> Scope and Purpose of Document (overview)</LI>\r<LI> Project Summary</LI>\r   <UL>\r   <LI> Objectives</LI>\r   <LI> Major Activities</LI>\r   <LI> Management and Technical Constraints</LI>\r   </UL>\r</UL>\r\r<LI> Project Risks</LI>\r   <UL>\r   <LI> Risk Analysis</LI>\r       <UL>\r       <LI> Identification (what is the risk?)</LI>\r       <LI> Risk Estimation (how big a consequence would it have?)</LI>\r       <LI> Evaluation (how likely is it to occur?)</LI>\r       </UL>\r\r   <LI> Risk Management</LI>\r      <UL>\r      <LI> Risk Aversion Options (what can you do to avoid it?)</LI>\r      <LI> Risk Monitoring Procedures (how do you keep track of whether it is going\r      to occur?)</LI>\r      </UL>\r   </UL>\r\r<LI> Schedule</LI>\r    <UL>\r    <LI> Project Work Breakdown Structure</LI>\r    <LI> Task Network (include more detail than just your major deliverables)</LI>\r    <LI> Time-Line Chart (when are you going to finish your various work products?)</LI>\r    <LI> Resource Table (how is each team member going to be applied throughout\r    the weeks of the project?)</LI>\r    <LI> (You could use a tool like Microsoft Project to help you with parts of\r    this task.)</LI>\r    </UL>\r\r<LI> Project Estimates</LI>\r   <UL>\r   <LI> Historical Data used for the Estimates (personal data? team data? application-domain\r   data (from other projects?))</LI>\r   <LI> Estimation Techniques</LI>\r   <LI> Estimates (how long is each sub-task going to take?)</LI>\r   </UL>\r\r<LI> Project Resources</LI>\r   <UL>\r   <LI> People (who is on the team?)</LI>\r   <LI> Hardware and Software</LI>\r   <LI> Special Resources</LI>\r   </UL>\r\r<LI> Staff Organization</LI>\r    <UL>\r    <LI> Team Structure (What do you expect to be the team's organizational structure?\r    Who reports to whom?)</LI>\r    <LI>\r    Member Responsibilities (How are management and clerical tasks carried\r    out ? e.g., who will manage which phases and who will provide clerical\r    support?
