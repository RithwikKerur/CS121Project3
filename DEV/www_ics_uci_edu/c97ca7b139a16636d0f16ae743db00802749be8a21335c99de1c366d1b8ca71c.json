For instance, the <A \nHREF=\"http://sfgate.com/new/schron/article-list.cgi?News:mn:today\"><B> \nSan Francisco Chronicle</B></A> offers a daily news service.  In addition, \nthere are also sports services such as <A\nHREF=\"http://www.starwave.com/SatchelSports.html\"><B>Satchel Sports</B></A>\nthat provide daily sports \nupdates.  For those \nwho wish to have up to \ndate weather reports, \nthere are a couple of \n<A HREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/News/Daily/Weather/\"><B> \nweather services</B></A> availabe through the web as well. Web users \ninterested in keeping tabs on tinseltown can access the <A HREF=\" \nhttp://metaverse.com/vibe/sleaze/index.shtml\"><B>Cyber Sleaze</B></A> \nreport available on the web.  These services represent just a few of the \nmany available for those web users interested in current up to date \naccounts of the world around them. \n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>Is there a service on the web that allows me to access a database including motion pictures? </B></A><br>\nActually, there is a very comprehensive service available through the web \nthat provides detailed information about thousands of motion pictures.  \nNot only does this <A HREF=\"http://www.msstate.edu/Movies/\"><B> movie \ndatabase</B></A> provide access to thousands of titles, but there are \nalso more specialized databases available as well.  For example, \naccessing the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.msstate.edu/Movies/top_40_films.html\"><B> top 40 \nfilms,</B></A> as rated by web users, is a helpful way to find some good \nmovies.  A summary of <A \nHREF=\"http://www.msstate.edu/M/on-this-day\"><B> Hollywood \nbirthdays</B></A> is available to those interested.  This page also \nincludes a list of today's anniversaries of Hollywood's deceased stars.\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>How many students are political science majors and how does this compare to the number of english students?</B></A><br>\nThe majors have very similar enrollments but english has a few more \nstudents enrolled than political science.  UC Irvine's web service \nprovides enrollment statistics for all majors, listed by school.  The \nregistrar says that 525 students are enrolled as <A \nHREF=\"gopher://gopher-server.cwis.uci.edu/00/departments/oas/students/enrl/1994-1995/majors/ss\"><B> political science</B></A> students and that 557 students are enrolled as <A HREF=\"gopher://gopher-server.cwis.uci.edu/00/departments/oas/students/enrl/1994-1995/majors/hum\"><B> english</B></A> students.\nIn addition to \nenrollment statistics, \nthe registrar can also \nprovide information \nmore commonly found in \nthe UCI catalogue.  Using the web, information about the <A HREF=\"\ngopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/flyers/english\"><B> english</B></A> \nmajor and <A HREF=\"  \ngopher://uniedit.cwis.uci.edu:7026/00/flyers/poli.sci\"><B> political \nscience</B></A> major is easily available. \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>How does enrollment vary between an introduction to law class and an introduction to criminal law class?</B></A><br>\nInterestingly \nenough, there seems to be far greater interest in criminal law classes \nthan in standard introduction to law classes. The enrollment numbers for \n<A HREF=\" \ngopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/00/ro/soc/W95/CRM.LAW/%20J%20%207%20%20\"><B> \ncriminal law J7</B></A> and<A HREF=\"\n gopher://ka.reg.uci.edu/00/ro/soc/W95/POL%20SCI/%20%20%2071A%20\"><B> \npolitical science 71A</B></A> reflect this trend.  One theory is that \nhigh profile cases such as the Menendez murder trial, the Rodney King \ncase and the O.J. Simpson murder trial have generated an increased \ninterest in areas of study involving criminal law.  With the mass media \nplacing such a high priority on criminal law cases, it is no wonder why \nstudents are enrolling in criminal law classes over general law classes \nby a six to one margin.\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><B>How do the services of the Department of Justice \ndiffer from the Federal Bureau of Investigation?</B></A><br>\nWhile both agencies come under the authority of the executive branch, the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation is actually a division of the Department \nof Justice.  When the <A HREF=\" \nhttp://lcweb.loc.gov/global/executive/justice.html\"><B> Department of \nJustice</B></A> learns of a criminal or civil wrongdoing, the <A \nHREF=\"http://naic.nasa.gov/fbi/FBI_homepage.html\"><B> Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation</B></A> investigates the matter further.  Once a \nprosecutorial decision is made, the Department of Justice assumes \nresponsibility for the matter and an attorney is assigned.  Therefore, \nAttorney General Janet Reno technically has authority over the F.B.I. \nHowever, it is well known that in sensitive issues, the Director of the \nF.B.I. reports directly to the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Family/images/raw/bill-sax.gif\"><B>President of \nthe United States.</B></A>\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 08, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
