For more details on this project please read the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dchudova/278/Report.html\">full\nfinal project report</a>.\n<p>\n<hr>\n<h2>\nBackground on the Data Set</h2>\nThe transactional data I used for the project reflect the purchases that\noccurred during the two year period in the large chain retail stores. There\nis a total of ~500,000 transactional records that correspond to ~190,000\ndifferent customers. The data were supplied by one of the commercial firms\nand is thus considered confidential.\n<p>\n<hr>\n<h2>\nDescription of the Task</h2>\nI aimed at classification and discovery of local patterns in the transactional\ndata. The labels for classification were assigned based on how often the\ncustomer made purchases in the store over a two year period. The input\ndata were constructed as a frequency of purchases made by each customer\nin a department or alternatively as a relative customer's spending in the\ndepartment. The data set consisted of 8150 examples with 55 continuous\nattributes. The input data were built using a subset of 50000 transactions.\n<p>\n<hr>\n<h2>\nDescription of the Data Mining Algorithm</h2>\nI used decision tree induction algorithm <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mlearn/ml_programs/Programs.html\">C5.0</a>\navailable as an ICS module. C5.0 decision trees create piece wise constant\ndecision boundaries in the original attribute space. I also used C5.0 to\nproduce a set of local ruled based on the decision trees.\n<p>\n<hr>\n<h2>\nExperimental Methodology</h2>\nI used cross validation to estimate performance of the classifier on the\nunseen data. For a total&nbsp; of 8150 examples, I used 10 folds, with\neach fold preserving the proportion of negative and positive examples found\nin the original full data set. To estimate <a href=\"Report.html#ClassificationResults\">the\nperformance of decision trees</a>, I looked at CV error, standard deviation\nof CV error, false negative, and false positive rate. To estimate the quality\nof local rules, I looked at the total number of rules, rule length, and\nrule confidence.\n<p>\n<hr>\n<h2>\nResults and Interpretation</h2>\n<a href=\"Report.html#ClassificationResults\">Classification</a>\n<p>High generalization ability of classifier is supported by the following\nresults:\n<ul>\n<li>\nHigh average CV accuracy</li>\n\n<li>\nLow variance of classification accuracy across folds</li>\n</ul>\n<a href=\"Report.html#LocalRules\">Local Rules</a>\n<ul>\n<li>\nGood generalization ability: an average of 45 rules for ~7000 patterns</li>\n\n<li>\nRelatively <a href=\"Report.html#RuleLength\">short rules</a>: most of the\nrules don't involve more than 3-4 departments</li>\n\n<li>\n<a href=\"Report.html#RuleConfidence\">High confidence</a> of rules: half\nthe rules have a confidence greater than 0.95</li>\n</ul>\nSee also <a href=\"Report.html#Extensions\">possible extensions of work</a>\n<br>\n<hr WIDTH=\"100%\">\n<br>A full archive of the project can be found at <a href=\"278Report.zip\">278Report.zip</a>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
