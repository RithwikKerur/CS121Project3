Barrett, Lori A. Clarke, Peri L. Tarr, and Alexander E. Wise \nin Technical Report 94-047,\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1994.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nAlthough event-based software integration is one of the most prevalent \napproaches to loose integration, no consistent model for describing it \nexists. As a result, there is no uniform way to discuss event-based \nintegration, compare approaches and implementations, specify new event-based \napproaches, match user requirements with the capabilities of event-based \nintegration products, and so on. We attempt to address these shortcomings \nby specifying a generic, event-based integration framework that provides \na flexible model for discussing and comparing event-based integration \napproaches. This model supports dynamic and static specification, composition \nand decomposition, and can be instantiated to describe the features of \nmost common event-based integration approaches. To demonstrate this, \nmappings to several popular products are presented.\n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 26 11:51:31 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
