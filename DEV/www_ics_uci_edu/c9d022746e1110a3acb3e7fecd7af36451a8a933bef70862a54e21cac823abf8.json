Leung</a>, ICS,\nUC Irvine</h2>\n\nWe consider the scheduling of jobs that may be competing for\nmutually exclusive resources. We model the conflicts between jobs\nwith a <i>conflict graph</i>, so that the set of all concurrently\nrunning jobs must form an independent set in the graph. This model\nis natural and general enough to have applications in a variety of\nsettings; however, we are motivated by the following two specific\napplications: traffic intersection control and session scheduling\nin high speed local area networks with spatial reuse. Our results\nfocus on two special classes of graphs motivated by our\napplications: bipartite graphs and interval graphs. In all of the\nupper bounds, we devise algorithms which maintain a set of\ninvariants which bound the accumulation of jobs on cliques (in the\ncase of bipartite graphs, edges) in the graph. The lower bounds\nshow that the invariants maintained by the algorithms are tight to\nwithin a constant factor. \n\n<p>The best competitive ratio achievable by any online algorithm\nfor the maximum completion time on interval or bipartite graphs is\nOmega(<i>n</i>), where <i>n</i> is the number of nodes in the\nconflict graph. As a result, we study scheduling with conflicts\nunder probabilistic assumptions about the input. Each node <i>i</i>\nhas a value <i>p<sub>i</sub></i> such that a job arrives at node\n<i>i</i> in any given time unit with probability <i>\np<sub>i</sub></i>. Arrivals at different nodes and during different\ntime periods are independent. We focus on distributions where the\nexpected time to complete the jobs that arrive in a single time\nunit is less than 1. Under these assumptions, we are able to obtain\na bounded competitive ratio for an arbitrary conflict graph. In\naddition, if the conflict graph is a perfect graph, we give an\nalgorithm whose competitive ratio converges to 1.</p>\n\n<p>For the specific application of traffic signal control, we\nsimulate our simple K<sub>2,2</sub> algorithm on a traffic network\nwith Poisson arrivals at the edges of the network and Robertson's\nplatoon dispersion model within the network. In some cases, our\nsimple algorithm achieves significant improvements over actuated\ncontrol.</p>\n\n<p>(Practice job interview talk.)</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
