Set up your environment\n</h2>\nFollow the instructions and considerations included in the Discussion's Slides to complete the steps to set up your environment.\n<ol>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/\">Eclipse</a>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html\">Subclipse plug-in</a>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/setup-easy.html\">ArchStudio plug-in</a>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http://www.isr.uci.edu/projects/archstudio/setup-fromsource.html\">ArchStudio and Myx Source Code</a>\n<li>Install <a href=\"LunarLander.zip\">Lunar Lander</a> \n<li>Install OpenGL Libraries for <a href=\"http://download.java.net/media/jogl/builds/archive/jsr-231-1.1.0/jogl-1.1.0-windows-i586.zip\">Windows</a> or for <a href=\"http://download.java.net/media/jogl/builds/archive/jsr-231-1.1.0/jogl-1.1.0-macosx-universal.zip\">MAC</a>\n<li>Run ArchStudio\n<li>In the new Eclipse Instance:\n<ol>\n<li>Install Myx Source Code \n<li>Install Lunar Lander\n</ol>\n<li>Run Lunar Lander\n<li>Commit LL code in SVN \n</ol>\n\n\n<h2>\nPart 2. Discussion\n</h2>\n\n2.1 (20 points) Discuss your experience setting up your environment. Comment what was the easiest and most difficult element to install? What was the easiest and most difficult element to configure?\n<br>\n2.2 (50 points) List all the components in the Lunar Lander architecture and describe the responsibility of each component in the architecture.\n<br>\n2.3 (10 points) Discuss what are the different types of connectors used in the architecture. What is the difference between these types? \n<br>\n2.4 (10 points) Do you consider that this architecture could be improved? How? If not, why not?\n<br>\n2.5 (10 points) Include a screen shot of the SVN Repository View in your report showing the LL code you committed in your repository in Step 10.\n<h2>\nDeliverables\n</h2>\nYour assignment must be submitted electronically to <a href=\"http://checkmate.ics.uci.edu/\">Checkmate.</a> You will submit:\n<li>Report.pdf including the answers to the discussion questions and screen shot requested in Part 2.\n</body>\n</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
