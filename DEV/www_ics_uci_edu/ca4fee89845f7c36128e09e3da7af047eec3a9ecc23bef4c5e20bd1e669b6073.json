Agreement: yes.  Binding replacement should\nbe the default.\n\n* Discussion of integrity maintenance on bindings.  Agreement that\n  bindings should have strong integrity.  There should not be any way\n  to specify integrity, weak or otherwise.\n\nSome concern by Jim Whitehead that strong integrity doesn't add much\ninteroperability.  Geoff Clemm feels strongly that strong integrity is\nneeded for interoperability.  No action taken, may be revisited when\ndefinitions of strong integrity are complete.\n\n* Discussion of redirect references on collections.  Jason noted that\n  he too is uncomfortable with having redirect references on\n  collections have \"URL addition semantics\", noting that there is no\n  current experience with this kind of behavior.\n\nAction items:\n\n* Geoff volunteers to develop the semantics of bindings, including\n  semantics of strong integrity.\n* Jim will start thread on redirect references on collections on\n  the discussion list\n\n*** Call ends\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
