Abraham,\nRob W. Irving, Kurt Mehlhorn and Kavitha Telikepalli from SODA 2005.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe authors consider the problem of matching a set of applicants to a set\nof posts.  Each applicant contains a preference list ranking each post by\npreference.  A matching M is then said to be popular if there is no\nmatching M' such that the number of applicants preferring M' to M exceeds\nthe number of applicants preferring M to M'.  The authors give an\nO(sqrt(n) m ) time algorithm finding the largest popular matching if it\nexists.  Note that this is a special case of the stable marriage problem -\nAll popular matchings are stable.\n\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
