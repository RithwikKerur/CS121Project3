I just wanted to experience what it was like working with other people on a project like this. </p>\n\n<p><b>What do you think is the overall goal of the project?</b> I think the overall goal is to get a suitable software that deliver fun for kids that would be educational and on the same token for people who know more about technology, it's about exploring different technologies.</p>\n\n<p><b>What was your favorite part of [or working on] the project?</b> I must say my favorite part would be modeling the plants. Since I haven't done it before, it took a lot of time and restarts, just basically banging your head on the same thing over and over again trying to get it to work.</p>\n\n<p><b>What are your career goals/interests?</b> First graduate from this place, and go to business school or go work in my dad's company.</p>\n\n<p><b>What are the other projects you've worked on?</b> I haven't done any projects for UCI, but I've done web design and stuff like that for other companies.</p>\n\n<p><b>Have you gotten any awards and/or publications?</b> I've gotten an academic achievement award.</p>\n\n<p><b>Any other questions and/or answers would you like on your site?</b> Not really.</P>      \n\n\n\n\n<P>\n\n</P>\n\n\n\n\n<HR>\n\n<P><SMALL>Last updated: October 18, 2005</SMALL></P></TABLE>\n\n</BODY>\n\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
