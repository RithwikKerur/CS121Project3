Well known examples of\r\ngraphical models include Bayesian networks, constraint networks, Markov random fields\r\nand influence diagrams. Graphical models are applicable to diverse domains such as planning,\r\nscheduling, design, diagnosis and decision making.\r\n<p>\r\nThis dissertation is concerned with graphical model algorithms that leverage the structure\r\nof the problem. We investigate techniques that capitalize on the independencies expressed\r\nby the model\u2019s graph by decomposing the problem into independent components,\r\nresulting in often exponentially reduced computational costs.\r\n<br>\r\nThe algorithms that we develop can be characterized along three main dimensions: (1)\r\nsearch vs. dynamic programming methods; (2) deterministic vs. probabilistic information;\r\n(3) approximate vs. exact algorithms.\r\n<p>\r\nWe introduce the AND/OR search space perspective for graphical models. In contrast to\r\nthe traditional OR search, the new AND/OR search is sensitive to problem decomposition.\r\nThe AND/OR search tree search is in most cases exponentially smaller (and never larger)\r\nthan the OR search tree. The AND/OR search graph is exponential in the treewidth of the\r\ngraph, while the OR search graph is exponential in the pathwidth.\r\n<p>\r\nWe introduce mixed networks, a new graphical model framework that combines belief\r\nand constraint networks. By keeping the two types of information separate we are able to\r\nmore efficiently exploit them by specific methods. We describe the primary algorithms for\r\nprocessing such networks, based on inference and on AND/OR search.\r\n<p>\r\nIn terms of approximate algorithms, we investigate message-passing schemes based on\r\njoin tree clustering and belief propagation. We introduce Mini-Clustering (MC), which\r\nperforms bounded inference on a tree decomposition. We then combine MC with the iterative\r\nversion of Pearl\u2019s belief propagation (IBP), creating Iterative Join-Graph Propagation\r\n(IJGP). We show empirically that IJGP is one of the most powerful approximate schemes\r\nfor belief networks. Through analogy with arc consistency algorithms from constraint networks,\r\nwe show that IBP and IJGP infer zero-beliefs correctly, and empirically show that\r\nthis also extends to extreme beliefs.\r\n<p>\r\nWe apply the AND/OR paradigm to cutset conditioning and show that the new method\r\nis a strict improvement, often yielding exponential savings. The AND/OR cutset is the\r\ninspiration of a new caching scheme for AND/OR search, which led to the design of our\r\nmost powerful and flexible algorithm AND/OR Adaptive Caching.\r\n<p>\r\nFurthermore we make a comparison of AND/OR search and inference methods. We\r\nanalyze them side by side by describing the context minimal graph that they traverse. We\r\nalso investigate three hybrid schemes, based on search and inference and show that Adaptive\r\nCaching is never worse than the other two.\r\n<p>\r\nFinally, we apply the AND/OR perspective to decision diagrams. We extend them\r\nwith AND nodes capturing function structure decomposition, resulting in AND/OR Multi-\r\nValued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs). The AOMDD is a canonical form that compiles a\r\ngraphical model and has size bounded exponentially by the treewidth, rather than pathwidth\r\n(as is the case for OR decision diagrams). We present two compilation algorithms, one\r\nbased on AND/OR search, the other based on a Variable Elimination schedule.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<P>\r\n<A href=\"r147.pdf\"><b>PDF</b></a>\r\n</td></tr></table></center><br>\r\n\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n\r\n<!--- Begin Footer -->\r\n     <div id=\"footer\"><centeR>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu\">School of Information and Computer Science</A>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu\">University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3435</a>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter\">Dr. Rina Dechter</A>\n\r\n<A HREF=\"mailto:dechter_at_ics.uci.edu\">dechter at ics.uci.edu</A>\r\n\n</center></div>\r\n<!--- End Footer -->\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n<html>\r\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
