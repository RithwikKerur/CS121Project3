I may adjust these times at the end of the first week. Of course emergencies\n  may come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change. I'll\n  also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't skip it  without getting in touch).

Because every lab assignment is done with a partner, you'll do much of your work in the scheduled labs.

See </FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab</code></A><FONT >\n  for lab hours and other information.

(10%)<BR />\n<FONT ><I>\u2022 Weekly quizzes: </I>Given on line through EEE, available from Sunday afternoon through 11:00 p.m. Tuesday.\n(10% together). </FONT><FONT ><FONT >Because these are self-graded, you get credit for completing them, whatever your answers. We cannot support make-ups for missed quizzes, since all you have to do is read them and submit answers each week on EEE. This is easy credit to get; just don't forget to do each quiz by Tuesday.

Thus, comparison of scores between TAs is meaningless.</P>\n<P><FONT >Lab scores will be recorded on the web in the EEE Gradebook. We will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we\n  must ask that you bring your TA your grading questions within a week after the\n  item is returned; the course moves quickly and we simply can&#39;t deal\nwith assignments long past.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT >Our goal is to obtain the fairest overall grade outcomes. We find that we achieve this best by not committing in advance to a specific fixed point scale for assigning final letter grades in the course. Thus, no letter grades apply to anything until the end of the course and it is not possible to calculate your letter grade precisely until all the work has been done. Don't ask, &quot;What grade am I getting so far?&quot;; instead ask, &quot;What more can I do to master the material?&quot; or &quot;What should I have done differently on this assignment (or exam)?&quot; We urge everyone to focus not on letter grades but on learning what's necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</FONT> You should check EEE <!--the EEE gradebook --> periodically to make sure your assignment scores have been recorded correctly. EEE <!--EEE--> also indicates where your score falls compared to other students; if you find yourself in the bottom quarter consistently, talk with your TA or the instructor.</P>\n<P>We're required to say that in unusual circumstances, these policies may change, but we do not expect that to happen.</P>\n<P>\n<FONT ><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations.

You\n  will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about parts\n  that aren&#39;t clear. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >The assignments, like all technical specifications,\n  require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back\n  to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about\n  what&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure\n  to read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Start each assignment early.  Assignments will\n  be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly every\n  day, especially after the first couple of weeks.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will,\n  even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll\n  have time to ask in lab about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >If you find yourself having trouble or getting\n  behind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  We have lots of ways to help.\n  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and\n  turning it in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on\n  a lab assignment or exam. ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more\n  complete discussion, see our course collaboration guidelines (<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html</code></a>) and the ICS departmental web page covering academic\nhonesty issues (</FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty</code></A><FONT >).</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Turn in whatever portion of an assignment you\n  have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something\n  rather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances\n  you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after the\n  due date, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date\n  comes.  Likewise, don&#39;t skip any quizzes or partner evaluations if you can help it; too many zeroes will significantly lower your overall score.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Always keep your own copy of each assignment,\n  both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\n  shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),\n  we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT ><B>Approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n</p><TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0>\n  <COL WIDTH=8% />\n  <COL WIDTH=15% />\n  <COL WIDTH=77% />\n  <TR>\n    <TD WIDTH=8% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Week</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=12% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Date</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=80% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Topics </U></FONT></TD>\n  </TR>\n  <!--\n  <TR>\n    <TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
