Successive convergents have differences that are unit fractions.

It is clear from the construction of the secondary sequence, and from the fact that the final result has denominators that are products of pairs of numbers in the secondary sequence, that all fractions are distinct.  The fact that the sum of the fractions is the original input number\nis a straightforward but tedious exercise in algebraic manipulation.  The number of terms in the Egyptian fraction representation of x/y is the sum of the odd terms after the first in the continued fraction list,  which is at most x.  Each fraction is a difference between two secondary convergents with denominator at most y, so each fraction has denominator at most y^2.\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\nEgyptContinuedFraction[18/23]\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>\n 1  1  1   1    1\n{-, -, --, --, ---}\n 2  6  12  36  207\n</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\n<A NAME=\"grouped\"><H3><IMG SRC=\"mmaSubSection.gif\" ALT=\"+\">\nThe Grouped Continued Fraction Method\n</H3>\n<P>\n</A>The worst case for the continued fraction method above occurs when the continued fraction representation has only three terms producing a long secondary sequence.  In this case the Egyptian fraction representation will involve long sequences of fractions of the form\n1/(a+b i)(a+b(i+1)).  If we add k consecutive values in such a sequence, we get\nk/(a+b i)(a + b(i + k)); it may happen that this can be simplified to a unit fraction again.  By performing several simplifications, we both reduce the number of terms in the overall representation and also reduce some denominators.  For instance, the continued fraction method for 7/15 gives\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>\n 1  1   1   1   1    1    1\n{-, --, --, --, --, ---, ---}\n 3  15  35  63  99  143  195\n</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nBut 1/15 + 1/35 + 1/63 = 1/9, and 1/99 + 1/143 + 1/195 = 1/45, so we can replace these triples and find the shorter representation \n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>\n 1  1  1\n{-, -, --}\n 3  9  45\n</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nThis phenomenon is not unusual, and Bleicher\n<A HREF=\"refs.html#Ble72\">[Ble72]</A> showed how to take advantage of it to dramatically reduce the number of terms produced by the continued fraction method.

We partition the secondary sequence into blocks of arithmetic progressions and find groupings separately within each progression; this is safe as the sum of all fractions from one progression is smaller than half of any fraction in a previous progression.  Within a progression, we determine which groups of terms can be combined to form a unit fraction, and represent each group as an edge in a graph, labelled with the corresponding unit fraction.  For the example above, the graph has eight vertices and ten edges, as follows:\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"egypt_5_2_0^1.gif\" WIDTH=337 HEIGHT=102></CENTER>\n<P>\nEach edge is directed from left to right.  The horizontal edges represent the original terms produced by the continued fraction method, while the longer edges represent the groupings that result in unit fractions.  Our task then becomes one of finding the shortest path through this graph, with the restriction that we cannot use two edges with the same label.\n<P>\nUnfortunately finding paths without repeated labels is NP-complete, so an efficient algorithm for this subproblem is unlikely to exist.  Fortunately most of the time our graphs have few repeated labels and the problem is not as hard as its worst case.  We use the following heuristic: for increasing values of k, find all paths of k or fewer edges, and filter out the paths with repeated labels; if not all paths are filtered out, return the remaining list of paths.  The theoretically fastest algorithm for listing all short paths takes constant time per path, after preprocessing time proportional to the time to find a single shortest path\n<A HREF=\"refs.html#Epp94\">[Epp94]</A>, however for ease of implementation we use a simpler method invented by Byers and Waterman\n<A HREF=\"refs.html#BW84\">[BW84]</A>. (The motivation of both papers was not Egyptian fractions, but rather comparison of DNA and protein sequences; this also turns out to be equivalent to a certain shortest path problem.)\n<P>\nFirst we include code to make an adjacency matrix for a graph, containing in each entry either the fraction corresponding to an edge in the graph, or the empty set if no such edge exists (i.e. if the corresponding sum of terms does not reduce to a unit fraction).  The input to this routine is the secondary sequence of the continued fraction.\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\nECFMakeGraph[l_] :=\n\tTable[If[i&lt;j, (If[Numerator[#]===1,#,{}]&amp;)\n\t\t\t\t\t[Rational[j-i, l[[i]] l[[j]] ]],\n\t\t\t {}],\n   \t\t  {i,1,Length[l]},\n    \t  {j,1,Length[l]}]\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nNext we include a shortest path algorithm, which takes as input the adjacency matrix above and produces a vector of distances from vertices to the last vertex.

We will call this algorithm repeatedly, using larger and larger values of b, until we find a path without repeated labels.  Our implementation takes as input the graph, the value of b, the vertex to start at, the number of vertices, and the vector of distances produced above, but all but the first two can be omitted (in which case we supply appropriate values automatically).\n<P>\nThe technique is simply to build the path one edge at a time.  At each step we compute a value d measuring the amount by which the path length would increase if we followed the given edge instead of keeping to the shortest path (d=0 for shortest path edges).

It remains to verify that no fraction is duplicated.  This is checked explicitly within each subsequence, and the entire sum of any subsequence is less than half any single fraction in previous subsequences, so no two separate subsequences can produce duplications.\n<P>\nAs in the continued fraction method, the largest denominator in the representation of x/y is O[y^2].  The number of terms is still O[x] but it can also be analyzed in terms of y.\nBleicher [Ble72] shows that by choosing a prime p with gcd(a,p)=1 and p=O(log a),\nand using groups with sizes equal to powers of p, one can find a representation with\nO(p Log[b]/Log[p]) = O(Log[x]Log[y]/Log Log[y]) terms.\nSince the actual representation is chosen to have minimum length, it can be no longer than this.\nIt remains unclear whether the implementation above really takes polynomial time, or whether there can be sufficiently many repeated labels that the algorithm for listing short paths has to list a large number of paths and slows down to exponential.  However in practice this method seems to work well.  (Bleicher's method of grouping can apparently be done in polynomial time.)\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\nEgyptGroupedCF[31/311]\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>\n  1    1    1     1      1\n{{--, ---, ----, ----, -----}}\n  11  121  2541  9933  93611\n</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nThe graph constructed for 31/311 is too complicated to depict here.
