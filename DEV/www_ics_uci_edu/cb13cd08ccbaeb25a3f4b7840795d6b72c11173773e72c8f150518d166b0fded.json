Reiss, Department of Computer Science, Brown University\n</h3>\n<p>\nBroadcast message servers have been around for ten years now and have\nbeen used extensively in a range of applications.  In this talk we\nrelate our experiences with messaging in programming environments and\nother tools.  We point out several facets of messaging that, while\nnot immediately obvious, are important considerations in the design\nand development of a message system.  We conclude by discussing the\nimplications of these considerations for wide-area messaging. \n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
