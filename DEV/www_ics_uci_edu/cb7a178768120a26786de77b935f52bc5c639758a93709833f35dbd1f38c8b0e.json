Currently, all users of a program download the exact same version of that program from a hosting site or an App Store. In Franz&#8217;s approach, the App Store will contain a diversification engine that will generate a unique version of every program for every user. This process will occur automatically inside of the AppStore, so that neither the software creators nor the users downloading it need to be aware of it.\n</p>\n<p>\nFrom the end-user&#8217;s perspective, the different versions are indistinguishable and they all behave in exactly the same way, but internally, subtle differences make it impossible for an attacker to use the same attack for all the versions.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn order to make a large-scale attack successful, a perpetrator would have to launch many different attacks and would have no way of knowing which attack would succeed on which target.

Specifically, he said, industrialized civilizations&#8217; emphases on growth and consumption are deeply unsustainable. \nProfound transformations in personal, institutional and infrastructure goals will be necessary to support a more sustainable existence and IT can play an important role in this evolution. \n</p>\n<p>\nHe discussed the concept explored in his book, &#8220;Greening through IT,&#8221; that environmental issues occur on broad scales of time, space and complexity, but humans work best at narrower scales. &#8220;IT can help bridge this gap, enabling us to understand the complex chains of causality that underlie global climatic disruption, biodiversity loss, sea level rise and a host of other environmental issues,&#8221; he said. \nIT is also implicated in the creation of the world&#8217;s current environmental problems, he said, calling it a &#8220;force multiplier&#8221; that allows people to accomplish more and more. One way to approach these problems is to explore the ways in which IT can help alter unsustainable cultural norms and provide acceptable alternatives.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor example, he said, IT systems can help support local sustainable agriculture, public health, education and nutrition. They can provide social support and identity via social networking, virtualized workspaces and other support networks. These systems can also help people learn more about the world and how to live sustainably in it. \n</p>\n<p>\n&#8220;These are not new ideas,&#8221; he said. But in order to create necessary cultural change that can lead to increased sustainability, &#8220;we need more IT researchers to work on these projects.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><b><br/></b></p>\n<p><b><a name=\"ramanan_collaborates_on_next-generation_visual_computing\"></a>Ramanan Collaborates on Next-Generation Visual Computing<br/></b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Deva Ramanan\" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/dramanan.jpg\"/>\n<p><b>Deva<br/>Ramanan</b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\nAssistant professor of computer science <strong>Deva Ramanan</strong> will collaborate with Intel and Stanford University researchers to design innovative visual computing projects as part of a $100 million Intel initiative.  \n</p>\n<p>\nThe new Intel Science and Technology Center on the Stanford campus, announced this week, is the first of several such centers on university campuses planned by the semiconductor and microprocessor giant.

The database is also growing fast, with thousands of updates every day.\n</p>\n<p>\nSearching MEDLINE has become an indispensable component in the daily life of medical practitioners, biological researchers, and an increasing number of patients who prefer to seek medical information through their own hands.\n</p>\n<p>\nCurrently, searching MEDLINE is primarily conducted through the PubMed web server, maintained by National Center for Biotechnology Information of NIH, which handles millions of searches per day. Given the high popularity and importance, it is critical to study how to make MEDLINE search more powerful and easier to use.\n</p>\n<p>\nLi and Xie, together with collaborators at Tsinghua University, China, have developed a system called <a href=\"http://ipubmed.ics.uci.edu\">iPubMed</a>, to study how to support instant, error-tolerant search on MEDLINE publications.\n</p>\n<p>\nTheir published paper in the journal <a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/18/2321.abstract\">Bioinformatics</a> demonstrated that the experience of searching MEDLINE can be significantly improved by instant search.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the new search paradigm, a user can view the search results instantly as he or she types each letter of the query. Because the user can modify the query on the fly according to the instantly returned results, it can take much less time for them to locate the right items.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis new search model is also gaining popularity in other domains. For instance, Google recently released a new web search tool called Google Instant, which implements the similar idea. The error-tolerant feature is especially important when the user does not remember the exact spelling of the keywords, such as a disease name or an author name.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe NIH grant will support Professors Li and Xie&#8217;s research efforts to further improve the iPubMed system.\n</p>\n<p>\nLi's research interests are in the fields of database and information systems, including Web search, large-scale data management, data cleansing, and data integration.\n</p>\n<p>\nXie's research focuses in machine learning, bioinformatics, computational biology and neural computation.

The UAI community is focused on developing algorithms for answering queries over knowledge-bases known as \"graphical models\" that represent both certain and uncertain information about the world.\n</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For example, the algorithms can express the information that if an individual is a smoker, their chances for developing cancer are higher than someonw who is&#160; a non-smoker. Given such statements with numerous additional such rules with and without numerical probabilities, which involve numbers in a particular domain such as medicine, researchers want to answer a variety of questions.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;When we get &#8216;evidence&#8217; or observations, we want to know how they change our &#8216;belief&#8217; about certain other facts,&#8221; says Dechter. &#160;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;The evidence in the example is &#8216;Peter is smoking&#8217;, and I want to know the probability that &#8216;Peter has cancer.&#8217;&#160; Or, I can have evidence that &#8216;Peter has cancer&#8217; and the question I am interested in is what is the probability that &#8216;Peter smokes.&#8217;&#8221;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Overall, when there is a probabilistic graphical model describing some world &#8211; such as the medical domain in the example above &#8211; and evidence on specific individual conditions, computer scientist often attempt to compute such answers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The UAI challenge is third in a series of events that challenge the UAI community to provide their code for approximation algorithms so that&#160; they&#160;&#160; all work on&#160; the same set of problems and run on the same machines. The results are then announced.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the UAI 2010 challenge Dechter and her team compared algorithms on each of three tasks, and for 3 different lengths of time, comparing the accuracy of their results against actual results.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Of the nine competing teams, Dechter with&#160; Vibhav Gogate (currently a postdoctoral student at university of Washington) &#160; were placed first on the&#160; two tasks and (with&#160; Lars Otten) placed third place on the third task.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Professor Dechter's research centers on computational aspects of automated reasoning and knowledge representation including search, constraint processing and probabilistic reasoning. The primary aim of her research is to devise efficient methods through the understanding and exploitation of tractable reasoning tasks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Professor Dechter is an author of the book \"Constraint Processing\" published by Morgan Kaufmann, 2003, and has authored over 100 research papers.&#160;</p>\n<p>&#160;</p>\n<hr/>\n<p><b><a name=\"olsons_distributed_collaborations\"></a>Olsons awarded $400,000 for study on distributed collaborations<br/></b></p>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Gary Olson\" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/golson.jpg\"/>\n<p><b>Gary<br/>Olson</b></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"img_caption_left\"><img alt=\"photo: Judy Olson\" src=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/bin/img/photos/faculty/jsolson.jpg\"/>\n<p><b>Judy<br/>Olson</b></p>\n</div>\n<p>\n<b>Gary</b> and <b>Judy Olson</b>, Bren Professors in Information and Computer Sciences, have been awarded $400,000 for their research entitled &#8220;Next Steps in Articulating Success Factors for Distributed Collaborations.&#8221;\n</p>\n<p>\nThe Olsons have spent the past decade studying work at a distance, both in science and engineering venues as well as in corporations.

The goal of &#8232;FIA is to design a more effective, trustworthy and robust Internet protocols and techniques.\n</p>\n<p>\nLed by Professor Lixia Zhang of UCLA, the NDN project will focus on Internet architecture that moves the communication paradigm from today's focus on \"where\" (i.e., Internet addresses, servers, and hosts), to \"what\" (i.e., content that &#8232;users and applications care about).\n</p>\n<p>\nCurrent Internet communication is based on a client-server model of interaction: communicating parties establish &#8232;a relationship and then proceed to transfer information contained within IP packets transported along one or more paths. However, the most predominant use of the Internet is actually centered on content creation, dissemination and delivery, &#8232;and this trend will continue for the foreseeable future. While the basic client-server model has enabled a wide range of services and applications, it does not offer adequate mechanisms to support secure content-oriented functionality, &#8232;regardless of the specific physical location where the content resides.\n</p>\n<p>\nBy naming data instead of its location (IP address), NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. &#8232;While the current Internet mainly secures the channel between communication points,&#8232;NDN secures the content and provides essential context for security.

This technique is widely regarded as the single biggest invention in compilers in 20 years.  His research impact currently extends to 500 million people globally using software that integrates his technique, such as Mozilla&#8217;s Firefox browser.  In addition, Franz&#8217;s research has enabled third world countries to connect using no-cost cloud software such as Gmail and Google Docs, thereby closing the gap in the &#8220;digital divide&#8221;. </p>\n<p>Franz&#8217;s invention is a radical departure from the long-established convention of  &#8220;control flow graph&#8221;, a technique used for over five decades to model a program&#8217;s control flow that a compiler builds and then traverses while generating code.  Instead of constructing a control-flow graph of the program, Franz&#8217;s patent-pending technique called Trace Tree utilizes an intermediate representation that is constructed on-demand while the program is simultaneously executed, incrementally compiled and optimized. </p>\n<p>The advantage of the Trace Tree technique is that it utilizes one-seventh (1/7) of the memory footprint and one-thirtieth (1/30) of the compile time of traditional compilers.  Working with the Mozilla foundation, Franz has incorporated this technique into the Firefox browser, beginning with version 3.5.  By incorporating the Trace Tree, Mozilla was able to raise Firefox&#8217;s JavaScript performance 700%. </p>\n<p>Franz is currently in collaboration with Adobe to incorporate his just-in-time compiler into their next version of Flash.  In addition, Google&#8217;s Android team has adopted Trace Compilation for the next generation smart phone operating system.  These integrations coupled with the Firefox deployment will result in the impact of potentially several billion devices. </p>\n<p>Professor Franz is director at UC Irvine&#8217;s Secure Systems and Software Laboratory. A Distinguished Scientist of the Association for Computing Machinery and a Senior Member of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Franz has graduated 13 Ph.D. students, been awarded more than $7 Million in competitive Federal research funding as Principal Investigator, and has published more than 90 refereed papers. </p>\n<p>The Academic Senate's Distinguished Faculty awards are selected by the Committee on Scholarly Honors and Awards. </p>\n<hr/>\n<b><a name=\"leon_receives_excellence_in_leadership_award\"></a>\n                   Leon receives Excellence in Leadership Award</b>\n<p><b>Christine Leon</b>, Director of Student Affairs, has been named one of three UC Irvine Excellence in Leadership Award winners. </p>\n<p>Leon was nominated by the Student Affairs Office staff for her excellent leadership of student affairs staff and was named an award winner by Executive Vice Chancellor-Provost Michael Gottfredson at last week's campuswide Staff Service Awards ceremony. </p>\n<p>The Excellence in Leadership Award Program recognizes select staff supervisors who &#8211; through outstanding leadership &#8211; enhance staff morale, build an enriching work environment, and serve as a mentor or otherwise support the career development of their staff, all to the benefit of our UCI community. </p>\n<p>EVC/Provost Gottfredson described Christine as a magnetic and engaging leader, who is selfless, honest and one who makes sound decisions for the good of her staff and the students of ICS.
