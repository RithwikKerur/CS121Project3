This problem was shown to be NP-complete\nby Arkin and Hassin and later W[1]-hard by Pilipczuk and Wahlstrom,\nparametrized by k. On the other hand, there is an XP algorithm by Cygan et\nal. and a polynomial time algorithm for graphs without directed edges by\nHassin and Megiddo. Chitnis and Feldmann showed W[1]-hardness of the problem\nfor graphs of genus 1. We consider a further restriction to planar graphs and\nshow NP-completeness.\n\n<p>\nPaper by\nMoritz Beck, Johannes Blum, Myroslav Kryven,\nAndre Loffler, and Johannes Zink.\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07496.pdf\">\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07496.pdf</a>\n\n</body></html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
