Suppose that we have data consisting of a set of intervals, but for\neach query we want to list the intervals that overlap (that is, have\nnonempty intersection with) a query interval.  Describe how to use an\ninterval tree to answer these queries efficiently.\n\n\n2. Suppose we wish to use a segment tree to maintain a dynamic set of\nintervals (with a known set of interval endpoints) and answer queries\nrequesting the total length of the union of the intervals.\n\n(a) For a segment s, let N(s) be the number of data intervals associated\nwith s, and let L(s) be the total length of the union of the segments\ndescending from s in the segment tree (including s itself) that have\nnonzero values of N(s).  Give a formula for computing L(s) from the\nvalues of N and L at s and its two children in the segment tree, and\nconclude that these quantities can be maintained efficiently as\nintervals are inserted and deleted in the segment tree.  How can we\ncompute the total length of the union of all the intervals from these\nquantities?\n\n(b) Suppose we are given a collection of n rectangles in the plane\n(static, so we don't have to worry about insertions and deletions)\nand we wish to compute the area of the union of the rectangles.\nDescribe how to solve this by a plane sweep algorithm using the dynamic\ninterval union length data structure of part (a).\n\n\n3. In the lecture we described a data structure for point location\n(given a collection of disjoint line segments in the plane, find the\nfirst segment hit by a vertical ray from a query point) based on\ncombining a segment tree on the horizontal projections of the segments\nwith, for each node of the segment tree, a binary search tree on\nvertically ordered line intervals associated with that segment.\nSuppose we wish to use fractional cascading to speed up the queries in\nthis structure. Would it work better to cascade from the root of the\nsegment tree towards the leaves, or vice versa. (Hint: for which of\nthese two directions can you define a consistent vertical ordering of\nthe cascaded set of intervals associated with each segment?)\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
