I'm more interested in the case where the quotient \nis a manifold. Can one recover the manifold or even the center from \na polyhedron? What can be said about the elements of the \nfundamental group which are represented as faces?\n\n&gt;     Even in the Euclidean case, the problem is not likely to be\n&gt;solved very soon, although there it's pretty obvious that the\n&gt;number of combinatorial types is bounded.

There are easy examples\n&gt;that show that the ARE some more.\n\nI suppose the higher-genus and really small ones wouldn't work. The\nonly way I know of getting arbitrarily small polyhedra which tile \nis by tiling the gap between two horospheres. Are there essentially \ndifferent tilings?\n\n&gt;&gt; Is it still \n&gt;&gt; open whether the Dehn invariant of any polyhedron tiling H^3 is 0?\n&gt;\n&gt;    I don't know, but expect so.  This is not so hopeless - a\n&gt;counterexample tiling must have certain slightly paradoxical\n&gt;properties, and it's quite hopeful that one could use these\n&gt;to disprove its existence, so proving that the invariant must be 0.\n\nWell, I just typed out what I was trying to make work, but I think\nI just found a counterexample:\n\nConsider the (x,y,z+) upper-half plane model and the convex hull\nof the vertices (+-1,+-1,2), (+-1,+-1,1), (0,+-1,1), (+-1,0,1), and\n(0,0,1). In other words, a 2x2 square in the height 2 horosphere\nand 4 1x1 squares in the height 1 horosphere. Of course, the top \nsquare is congruent to the bottom squares. By translations in 2Zx2Z,\nthis shape tiles a region around the horosphere of height 2. This\nregion is congruent to regions around the horospheres of height 2^n\nfor all integers n; these tile H^3.\n\nNow, this shape probably doesn't have Dehn invariant 0. But even if\nit does, a small polygonal bump added to the top allows the same \nbump to be taken 4 times out of the bottom. So, choose the bump\nto have nonzero Dehn invariant D, and the new shape will have Dehn\ninvariant -3D.\n\n&gt;On the other hand, of course, if it needn't be, this could of course\n&gt;be proved by exhibiting just one special tiling.\n\nI hope the above works, but I've been up for some time so I actually\ncan't see it.\n\n&gt;    The paradoxical nature of the required tiling reminds me of\n&gt;another problem - that of defining the density of a sphere-packing\n&gt;in hyperbolic space.  \n\nFor foams in H^2 and H^3, I didn't find anything I could compute. \nWhat happens if you take the lim sup of the density within balls \nof increasing radius centered about each point p to get a function \nof p, and then iterate using the average value instead of density?\n\n&gt;I have read of a \"counterexample packing\"\n&gt;of spheres with the following properties:\n&gt;\n&gt;   i) There are two tilings T1 and T2 of the space into polyhedral\n&gt;cells that each contain just one of the spheres.\n&gt;\n&gt;  ii) Each of T1 and T2 admits an automorphism group of isometries\n&gt;that act transitively on its cells (so that all the cells of  Ti\n&gt;have the same volume, Vi).\n&gt;\n&gt; iii) The volumes  V1 and  V2  are different  (and both finite).\n\nThat is disturbing if the spheres are in any way symmetric or \nfairly large in comparison to V1 and V2. Otherwise, it still \ndisturbs me, but I suspect that frequently there exists a matching \nbetween the sets of tiles of two tilings given that the tiles have \nlarge diameter with respect to the ratio of their volumes, where a \ntile of T1 is adjacent to a tile of T2 iff their intersection \ncontains a ball of radius r.\n\n&gt;    Does anyone know a reference for this?\n&gt;\n&gt;      John Conway\n\nThanks,\n\nDouglas Zare\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~zare\">http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~zare</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
