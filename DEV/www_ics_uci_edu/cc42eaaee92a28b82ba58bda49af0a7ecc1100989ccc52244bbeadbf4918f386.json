(Similarly, a \n   WebDAV client might need to know all DAV: properties, but not care \n   about non-standard properties.) In such a case, the client must \n   choose between the <allprop> element, which will retrieve all \n   properties on the resource, and the <prop> element, which will \n   retrieve specified properties only. The problem with <allprop> is \n   that the resource may have many properties from other namespaces, in \n   which the application is not interested. The problem with <prop> is \n   that the client may not know all the property names which may be \n   present (for example, if the client is too general-purpose to permit \n   it to be configured with the list of property names, or if property \n   name munging is being used). A third choice would be to use \n\nStracke                                                       [Page 1]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV PROPFIND Namespace List      August 10, 1999\n\n   <propname> to list all the resource's properties without their \n   contents, then use <prop> with just the properties in the desired \n   namespace; the problem with this approach is that it requires an \n   extra HTTP request.\n\n   This document proposes a middle ground, an extension to <allprop> and\n   <propname> which provides a list of namespaces to search.\n\n   The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \n   \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this \n   document are to be interpreted as described in [MUSTS] .\n\n4 Extension definition\n\n   Two new XML elements are proposed, <namespace> and <namespaces>. In \n   the idiom of [WEBDAV]:\n\n4.1 namespaces XML Element\n\n   Name: namespaces\n\n   Namespace: DAV:\n\n   Purpose: The namespaces XML element specifies that the enclosing \n   allprop or propname element applies only to properties belonging to \n   the namespaces listed in the enclosed namespace elements.\n\n4.2 namespace XML Element\n\n   Name: namespace\n\n   Namespace: DAV:\n\n   Purpose: The namespace XML element specifies a namespace in the \n   namespaces list. <namespace> appears inside <namespaces>, and has a \n   single attribute, uri, the URI of the namespace.\n\n5 Examples\n\n5.1 Fetching all DAV: properties\n\n   Request:\n         PROPFIND /index.html HTTP/1.1\n         Host: www.example.com\n         Content-Length: xxxx\n         Content-Type: text/xml\n\n         <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n         <D:allprop>\n         <D:namespaces>\n         <D:namespace uri=\"DAV:\"/>\n         </D:namespaces>\n         </D:allprop>\n\nStracke                                                 [Page 2]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV PROPFIND Namespace List      August 10, 1999\n\n         </D:propfind>\n\n\n   Response:\n         HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n         Content-Type: text/xml\n         Content-Length: xxxx\n\n         <D:prop xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n         <D:lockentry>\n         <D:lockscope><D:exclusive/></D:lockscope>\n         <D:locktype><D:write/></D:locktype>\n         </D:lockentry>\n\n         <D:lockentry>\n         <D:lockscope><D:shared/></D:lockscope>\n         <D:locktype><D:write/></D:locktype>\n         </D:lockentry>\n\n         <D:creationdate>1999-08-11T12:12:12Z</D:creationdate>\n         <D:displayname>Example.com, The Fictious Site!</D:displayname>\n         <D:getcontentlength>17</D:getcontentlength>\n         <D:getcontenttype>text/html</D:getcontenttype>\n         <D:getetag>xyzzy</D:getetag>\n         <D:getlastmodified>1999-08-11T12:12:14Z</D:getlastmodified>\n         <D:resourcetype></D:resourcetype>\n\n         </D:supportedlock>\n\n         </D:prop>\n\n\n5.2 Listing names of properties in two namespaces\n\n   Request:\n         PROPFIND /index.html HTTP/1.1\n         Host: www.example.com\n         Content-Length: xxxx\n         Content-Type: text/xml\n\n         <D:propfind xmlns:D=\"DAV:\">\n         <D:propname>\n         <D:namespaces>\n         <D:namespace uri=\"http://foo.example.com\"/>\n         <D:namespace uri=\"mailto:fred@example.com\"/>\n         </D:namespaces>\n         </D:propfind>\n         </D:propname>\n\n\n   Response:\n         <D:prop xmlns:D=\"DAV:\"\n         xmlns:F=\"http://foo.example.com\"\n\nStracke                                                 [Page 3]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV PROPFIND Namespace List      August 10, 1999\n\n         xmlns:M=\"mailto:fred@example.com\">\n         <F:bar/>\n         <M:fred/>\n         </D:prop>\n\n\n6 Compatibility Considerations\n\n   Section 14 of [WEBDAV] specifies:\n\n         \"All DAV compliant resources MUST ignore any unknown XML \n         element and all its children encountered while processing a DAV\n         method that uses XML as its command language.\"\n\n   As a result, a client which uses <D:namespaces> on a server which \n   does not support it will get the base-level DAV behavior (listing all\n   properties), exactly as if it had issued a base-level DAV request. \n   Therefore, a client which sends PROPFIND requests using \n   <D:namespaces> MUST accept responses which include properties not in \n   the listed namespace(s).\n\n   Of course, it is always risky assuming that all implementations of a \n   young standard adhere to all points of the standard. In this case, \n   the risk is mitigated by the fact that section 23.3.2.2 of [WEBDAV] \n   presents a (hypothetical) similar extension, <E:leave-out>, and \n   states:\n\n         \"If the previous example were submitted to a server unfamiliar \n         with leave-out, the only result would be that the leave-out \n         element would be ignored and a propname would be executed.\"\n\n   Nevertheless, since there may be some servers which, for whatever \n   reason, violate this prescription (say, if they attempt to validate \n   the XML request against the DTD in section 23.2 of [WEBDAV] ), a \n   client which uses <D:namespaces> SHOULD be aware that it may receive \n   a 400 Bad Request from such a server, and SHOULD be able to retry the\n   request without using <D:namespaces>.\n\n7 Internationalization Considerations\n\n   This proposal builds on [WEBDAV], and inherits its \n   internationalizability.\n\n8 IANA Considerations\n\n   This proposal does not introduce any new IANA considerations, since \n   it does not specify any new namespaces (in the general sense), but \n   merely uses existing ones.\n\n9 Security Considerations\n\n   For a server, this proposal does not introduce any new security \n   considerations over those of [WEBDAV], since the information which is\n\nStracke                                                       [Page 4]\n\f\nINTERNET-DRAFT       WebDAV PROPFIND Namespace List      August 10, 1999\n\n   exposed is already available. There might be privacy considerations \n   for a client, since telling the server which namespaces one wishes to\n   search does reveal some information. Implementors must balance this \n   concern against the efficiency gains this proposal offers.\n\n10 Copyright\n\n   The following copyright notice is copied from RFC 2026 [Bradner, \n   1996], section 10.4, and describes the applicable copyright for this \n   document.\n\n   Copyright (C) The Internet Society April 5, 1998.
