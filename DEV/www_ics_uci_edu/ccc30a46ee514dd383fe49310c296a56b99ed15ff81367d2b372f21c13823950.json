I will put both of them together and talk about this paper which\npresents cryptographic and physical ZK protocols to prove that Alice has a\nsolution to a Sudoku puzzle. I will explain 2 of the cryptographic\nprotocols and 2 of the physical protocols from the paper.\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
