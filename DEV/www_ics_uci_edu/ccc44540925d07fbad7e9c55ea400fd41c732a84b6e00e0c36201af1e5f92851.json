The object is to form a path from S to\nthe home base (A for the first player, B for the second player) without\nvisiting any point more than once.  The first player to home base wins.\n \n\n      A.   .   .   .   .   .   .      \n\n       .   .   .   .   .   .   .    \n\n       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   \n\n       .   .   .
