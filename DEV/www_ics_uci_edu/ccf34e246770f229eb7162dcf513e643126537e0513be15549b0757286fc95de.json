How difficult \nis it to compute fundamental properties of a quantum system or simulate \na particular system over time? A central idea in understanding these questions \nis quantum entanglement. On one hand, entanglement is a valuable resource that \nenables quantum computation and communication. On the other hand, the fact that \nsome quantum systems have bounded entanglement accounts for the success of certain \ncomputational methods in finding ground states and simulating dynamics. I will \ngive an overview of recent work in understanding the complexity of ground states \nof quantum systems both from the perspective of computational complexity and \nfrom the perspective of quantifying entanglement. \n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
