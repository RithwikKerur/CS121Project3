In this auction framework, we\nconsider a bidder model where each participant has a probability p of\njoining a collective colluding group.  We show that any auction that is\nB-competitive without colluders, is B/(1-p)<sup>2</sup>-competitive in the presence\nof colluders no matter the colluding strategy.\n<p>\nThis is joint work with Sandy Irani, Gwendoline Shu-Hsien Chien, and\nMatthew Nguyen.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
