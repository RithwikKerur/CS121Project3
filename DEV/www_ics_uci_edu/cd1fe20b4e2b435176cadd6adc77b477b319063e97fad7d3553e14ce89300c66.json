We show that this problem, UNKNOTTING\nPROBLEM is in NP. We also consider the problem, SPLITTING PROBLEM,\nof determining whether two or more such polygons can be split(that\nis, whether they are capable of being continuously deformed without\nself-intersection so that they occupy both sides of a plane without\nintersecting it), and show that it also is in NP. Finally we show\nthat the problem of determining the genus of a polygonal knot (a\ngeneralization of the problem of determining whether it is\nunknotted) is in PSPACE.</p>\n\n<p>(From a FOCS '97 paper by Joel Hass, Jeffrey C.
