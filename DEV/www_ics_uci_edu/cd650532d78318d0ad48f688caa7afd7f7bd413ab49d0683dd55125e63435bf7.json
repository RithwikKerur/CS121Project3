In order to save and make money firms will tend to cut corners \nmany different ways. Here are just a few ways a business may cut corners:\n\n<ul>\n<li>Using lower quality goods for the production of their own goods.</li>\n<li>Using a substitute product by diluting their own good.</li>\n<li>Trick consumers, for example by false advertising.</li>\n</ul>\n\nAs we can see, cutting corners is not that hard to do. With today's \ntechnology it becomes even easier for a business to try and gain the extra \nedge.  With the emergence of computer advancements such as the Internet \nand the World Wide Web. It provides businesses with a <b>\"new tool\".</b>\n \n<p>We will now examine: \n<ul>\n<A href=\"#nt\"><li> How businesses use the \"new tool\" to advertise on the\nweb.</li></A>\n<A href=\"#change\"><li> How advertising with the \"new tool\" will change the \nway firms will buy, sell, and do business.</li></A>\n<a href=\"#conc\"><li> Is the \"new tool\" good or bad for \nbuisness?</li></A></ul> <hr>\n\n<A name=\"nt\"><h3>How businesses use the \"new tool\" to advertise on the\nweb.</h3></A>\n\n\n<p>This emergence of the \"new tool\" allows businesses to advertise their \nbusiness, their products, and general information. Advertising on the \nweb is not hidden. It takes only a few minutes for a user on a web \nbrowser to find examples of business advertising. Businesses tend to \nadvertise two different ways: <b>directly or indirectly.</b></p>\n\n<p><b>Direct</b> advertising by a business is when a firm will put out a \nspecific page on the web showing their product, a  specific service they \nprovide via the web, and even products for sale through the web or the \nphone. One can find many examples of direct advertising, such as:\n<ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.pizzahut.com/\"><li>Ordering pizza from Pizza Hut</li></a>\n<a href=\"http://branch.com/\"><li> Visit a mall with that carries almost \nanything you could want.</li></a>\n<A HREF=\"http://dorian.csi.nb.ca/~damber/lobster/\"><li>Have lobster \nFedExed from Nova Scotia.</li></A> </ul>\nThese are just to name a <i>few</i> of the many, many types of \nadvertising found on the web. For example one can just look up a \n<a href=\"http://ibd.ar.com/Catalogs/Catalog.HomePages.html\">catalog of \nvendors</a> or just \"surf the net\" for a product. </p>\n\n<p><b>Indirect</b> advertising by a business is very commonly found, \nwhether the firm knows they are advertising or not.  They are \nadvertising. This is the whole idea of what indirect advertising is all \nabout. Indirect advertising can be found through <a \nhref=\"http://www.yahoo.com/Entertainment/Magazines/\"> magazines</a> and \ngeneral information provided by businesses.  Here are a few examples of  \nindirect advertising:\n<ul>\n<a href=\"http://www.timeinc.com/ew/special/subinfo.html\"><li>Entertainment \nWeekly gives us a special subscription offer.</li></a>\n<a href=\"http://att.net/dir800\"><li>AT&T gives a list of 1-800 phone \nnumbers.</li></a></ul>\n<p>Like direct advertising, indirect advertising can be found almost \neverywhere on the web. The question now is: <i>How</i> does a firm \nadvertise? A business can do this two ways.  The first way is \nto make a company home page and the second way is to go through an \nadvertising service on the web. Even home pages can be processed and \npublished through special services. Services like\n<a href=\"http://www.business card.com/businesscard/\">Business Cards \nOnline,</a> <a href=\"http://www.mall.net/\">Internet Design Group,</A>\nand <a href=\"http://www.zynet.co.uk/zynet/tariff.html\">Zynet Services</a>  \ncan provide firms ads and home pages for the right price. A good \nexample of a business home page is <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\">Apple \nComputer's</a> home page or <a href=\"http://www.sony.com/\">Sony Music's</a> \nhome page.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<A name=\"change\"><h3>How advertising with the \"new tool\" will change the \nway we will buy, sell, and do business.</h3></a>\n<p> The internet has vastly changed the way that businesses have  \ntraditionally bought, sold, advertised, and communicated, between\nthemselves and with customers. The internet has increased the<i> speed\n</i> in which businesses can reach the consumers. It has reduced the<i>\ncost</i>associated with advertising. The internet<i> expands the  \nrange</i> to which advertising and marketing reaches.<a \nhref=\"http://tig.com/IBC/White/Communication.html\"> Communication \n</a>between the consumers and suppliers has also been bettered through the \nuse of the  internet.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of advertising and marketing a product has traditionally been\nhigh and to change the product line and then communicate the changes to\nthe consumer can be very cost-prohibitive, especially if done frequently.\nAssuming a 250 page catalog costs on the average $1.55 to produce, mailing\nthis to 250,000 people costs $387.800! The internet, even if we assumed\ncomparable cost can reach 20 million people. Think about the costs to\nupdate and send out a new catalog for summer. A <a \nhref=\"http://www.shopping2000.com/\">list of virtual catalogs</a> \ncan already be found on the internet. An advertisement on the internet can be\nconstantly updated and changed for a low cost. The speed of internet\n<a href=\"http://tig.com/IBC/White/Intermarket.html\">marketing, sales, and \nservice</a> can also help to keep ahead of the competitor. Consumer trends\ncan almost immediately be addressed and changes made to change the firm's\nactions accordingly. This saves  the company time and money. </p>  \n\n<p>The range and scope to which internet marketing and advertising   \nreaches is another change with which business must cope. larger and more\ndiverse groups of people can be reached on the web that may greatly\nenhance a firm's exposure and help them to reach a new consumer base that\nwould normally be restricted due to cost or lack of information. The  \nglobal aspect of the internet also makes any firm international and provides\ncustomers all over the world. Quite a benefit to any business.</p>  \n\n<p>The aspect of increased and better communication between the producer \nand consumer may be one of the most beneficial. Not only can a consumer  \norder over his own computer at home or at the office, the firm can\nprocess his order and even communicate via e-mail. E-mail is the most \nused of all internet tools and could become an important part of the   \nbusiness world. Examine a scenario where a business provides the   \nmarketing, and sale of a product over the internet. A person across the \nworld orders it and instantly his order is processed. If he chooses he\nprovides his e-mail address and fills out a short questionaire about  \nhimself and the product that he has just purchased. The firm also\nprovides an e-mail address if the consumer has any problems. A week late \nthe product has arrived and The consumer tries to put it together or\ninstall it or figure out how it works. He cannot. He e-mails the company\nwhich has 24 hour help and they send on-line text, pictures, diagrams and \nanything else that the consumer may need. This also is coupled with the\nstandard 1-800 phone line. So the buyer has his product, all the   \ninformation he can ask for, plus he gets it in the fastest time possible.\nThe business saves time and money on paperwork, gets info about the   \nconsumer that can help in their research and marketing, plus they have a\nfully satisfied customer. The better knowledge gained by the company about\nthe consumer through better communication results in the elimination of  \ncosts by offering what the consumer does want. The information and feedback\ncan also result in the bettering of a product. This may be more likely  \nthrough the internet due to the impersonal nature of using a computer to \nwrite  your comments via <a href=\"http://www.sco.com/comments.html\">a \ncomment form,</a> or answer some questions, ratherthan talking to a  \nrepresentative on the phone or having to write and mail a questionaire. </p>\n\n<p>While all of this may sound as a too-good-to-be-true advertising   \nutopia, be careful of what really exists and what actually can be done of\nthe internet. While 16 million people use the internet and its potential \nseems limitless, The actuality is that advertising here is a little bit  \ndifferent than the television-based kind that the average American is\nused to. New graphics, audio and video are beginning to transform the  \ninternet, the text based approach is still used heavily. Information on \nthe internet is demanded and given. The evolution has provided a new look \nto the internet, but a certain <a \nhref=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Etiquette.html\">web \netiquette</a> has been required of those that use this resource.  The  \nresult is a give and take idea. Considerable quantities of information \nare given and passed on the web and is given freely. The company that \nwishes to take and not give back may not be received so openly among the \ninternet users.</p> \n\n <hr>\n<a name=\"conc\"><h3>Is the \"new tool\" good or bad for buisness?</h3></a>\n<h3>CONCLUSION-Our opinion</h3>\n\n<p>The internet is a tool that can be very useful for business. As both\nthe internet and the business world evolve, the union between the two is\ninevitable. Already firms are discovering the usefulness and potential   \nthat the internet brings to their businesses. But can the internet handle \nthe increased influx of use and information that can be provided by the  \nswarm of businesses and their marketing and advertising strategies. Under\nits full potential the internet would be a wonderful thing. The\nconvenience that would be provided to consumers is without equal in our\nsociety today. Firms would better be able to serve, communicate, and\nexpand across this electronic highway. Business would be transacted in\nsuch a new, faster way that would involve more interaction and\ninformation retrieval that would cut down on the costs normally associated\nwith business today. The internet, however, is not ready today for \nthis amazing influx of information. The development of the internet must \nequal the increased demand for the use on it. The increased use of \nbusiness on the internet is not a bad thing, and in time it will develop \ninto a great resource for businesses, but for now business should not \novershadow the real purpose of the internet which is to provide  \ninformation on a global scale.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<P><A href=\"#TOP\">Return to the top of the paper. </A></P>\n<hr>\n<!--------===========CUT===HERE=========-------------->\nSubmitted March 16, 1995\nfor <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
