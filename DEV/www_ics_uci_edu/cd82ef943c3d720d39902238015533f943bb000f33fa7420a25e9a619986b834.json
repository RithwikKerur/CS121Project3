He has \nseen birds and insects flying and has wondered what the feeling must \nbe like. Then, when man was able to achieve flight, with the use of \nsome basic fluid physics and plain old ingenuity, he looked to go \nbeyond the barriers of the blue skies above.\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/icons/thinbar.gif\">\n<H2><A NAME=\"past\">The Past & Present: Earth Flight</A></H2>\nFrom the earliest of times, man has jealously studied winged beasts\nand yearned to share their freedom in the skies. And man, being an \nintelligent beast, has finally found success. The faltering flight of \nthe Greek youth Icarus, who flew too close to the sun, demonstrated that \nman does not innately fly.  Mankind went back to the drawing board \nand used his intellect to create a more stable platform on which to \nroam the skies: the airplane. \n\n<H3><A NAME=\"wright\">The Wright Brothers</A> and Their Flying \nMachine:</H3>\n\nIn September of 1904, a farmer's field in Dayton Ohio became the site \nof a miraculous\n<A HREF=\"http://hawaii.cogsci.uiuc.edu/invent/airphotos/public/First_Flight.jpeg\">\ncircling flight</A>.\nThis was the first flight\n<A HREF=\"http://dab.psi.net/ChapterOne/children/browse/wright.html>\nOrville and Wilbur Wright's</A> new contraption, the airplane\nThe flight lasted exactly one minute and thirty-six seconds, thrusting \nthe two bicycle repairmen into the record books for the \nlongest flight of an airplane.

He could fly a barnstorming carnival one day, \nand then be flying mail across the country the next.\n<P>\nIn 1927, the <A \nHREF=\"http://photo1.si.edu/images/gif89a/air-space/stlou1.gif\">\nSpirit of Saint Louis</A> had made a flight, non-stop across the \nAtlantic to Europe, with Charles Lindbergh at the controls. The world \nwas growing smaller by the year, a foreshadowing of the jet age, \nushered in by the military development of aircraft during the next \nwar, World War II.\n<H6><A HREF=\"#table\">Table of Contents</A></H6>\n\n<H3><A NAME=\"military\">The Military</A>\n<img src=\"http://www.vestnett.no/vulcan/pics/thumb/f117-1.gif\" ALT=\"f117-1.jpg\"></H3>\nIt is unfortunate that war and killing can lead to some of the \nquickest development in technology. It seems that some of the \ngreatest advances of aviation technology, or all in all technological \ndevelopment for that matter, have taken place to kill people more \nefficiently.\n<P>\nWhen airplanes first entered the military arena, they were used only \nfor reconnaissance purposes. This held true until one pilot took a gun \ninto the air, and then a bomb, turning the air arena upside down.\nThere was a new environment \nwhere it was kill or be killed, both for the pilots in the air, and \nfor the bombed out troops and civilians.\n<P>\nBased on the lessons of World War I, the bombers of World War II were \nmade to be much more efficient. This led to planes that flew higher and \nfaster, important in the emerging nuclear age. With the advent of \nnuclear \ncapabilities, it was thought that one either needed faster planes, or \nplanes that could fly higher. Either way, one would have to escape the \neffects of delivering nuclear ordnance. And even with this, much \nresearch was being done in the mixed arena of missile/space research \nto potentially make aircraft obsolete for these purposes .\n<P>\nThe military, in an effort to describe its operations more fully in \nan environment of downsizing and spending cuts, has found it helpful \nto describe their operations on a more pronounced scale, especially \nby putting some of their public information on the World Wide Web. \nThis seems to help build a rapport with the taxpayers\n<P>\nThe <A HREF=\"http://www.af.mil/\">United States Air Force</A>\nhas an extensive server which gives the description of many of the \nunits under its command and gives as much de-classified information \nas possible. It is unfortunate that they still do not have more \nhistorical information available, but they seem to be \nforging ahead with new projects and leaving the past to another day.\n<H6><A HREF=\"#table\">Table of Contents</A></H6>\n<H3><A NAME=\"civil\">Civil Aviation</A></H3>\nWhen it comes to Civil Aviation, one may think of late planes, and \nhoney-roast peanuts and which is sometimes true. But, were it not for \nthe pioneers of the past and the pressures of war development,\nwe would not have quality commercial pilots flying\nour planes today. Nor would flying be one of the safest and most \nrapid methods of travel over long distances. We owe some of this to \nthe military training of our pilots, and also to the \ndevelopment of the new technologies pilots test and use.\n<P>\nThe <A HREF=\"http://www.yahoo.com/Business/Corporations/Travel/Airlines/\">\nyahoo index of airlines</A> provides a link to some of the \ncommercial airlines, but something that we didn't expect to see was \nadvertisements, which still seem to be the scourge of the internet.\n<P>\nCivilian aviators also enjoy use of the Web in that they are able to \ndisseminate the latest information to one one another. There are \nnumerous <A HREF=\"http://adswww.harvard.edu/GA/ga_servers.html\">\ngeneral aviation servers</A> available for people to browse. This is \nan excellent way to learn about and perhaps join a new\n<A HREF=\"http://adswww.harvard.edu/GA/ga_servers.html/#flying_clubs\">\nflying club</A>\n<P>\n<H6><A HREF=\"#table\">Table of Contents</A></H6>\n<IMG SRC=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/icons/thinbar.gif\">\n<H2><A NAME=\"space\">The Future: Space Flight</A></H2>\n<P>\nAfter man was able to fly in the air of the biosphere and stratosphere, \nand look down at the Earth from what was perceived as great height, he \nbegan to dream of going even higher to investigate the heavenly bodies \nsurrounding the small blue sphere that is home. Man had entered the space \nage.\n<P>\nGovernments, hungry for new resources, were eager to establish \nagencies and administrations to organize efforts to reach into space. The \nnature of space exploration to find resources has grown and changed along \nwith the world political climate: sometimes competitive, other times,\ncooperation is the order of the day. Sputnik, the first ever man-made\nsatellite to orbit the earth, was sent up by the Soviet Union, beating the\nUnited States' space program, and, beating national morale. According to\n<A HREF=\"gopher://gopher.well.sf.ca.us/00/matrix/internet/hobbes.internet.timeline\">\nHobbe's Internet Timeline**</A>, the launch of Sputnik was enough of a \npolitical catalyst to lead to the formation of the Advanced Research \nProjects \nAgency within the U.S. Department of Defense, the organization that helped \nbegin the creation of the internet. But cooperation reigns now, with a \njoint Russian/U.S. mission having gone into space just a few days before \nwriting this essay.\n<BR><I>**(Hobbe's Timeline does have the erroneous year \n1956 for Sputnik's launch. The actual year is 1957.)</I>\n<P>\nAgencies, in some cases asked to\n<A HREF=\"http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/~jgreen/fpspace.html\">\njustify their existence</A>, have found it \nnecessary to take their &quot;reason for being&quot; to the people of the \nnation, and the world. This means an agency has to advertise and \npublicize, but advertising is expensive, and needs to be big enough to \nattract the attention and support of the citizens of a nation, or, of the\nworld. \n<P>\nOne answer has been to link an agency with other agencies through\njoint, cooperative missions\nand by sharing research\nexperiences with scientists and general citizens on the Internet, \nespecially via the World Wide\nWeb. This allows the agency to make the case that they are keeping the\nnation competitive with other world powers, that they are spending well\nthe vast moneys allocated them, and that they are spending in a way which\nis efficient, relevant, and holds the agency accountable to the citizens, \nor to those funding the agency's programs.\n<P>\nOne can find links to\n<A HREF=\"http://www.nasa.gov/nasa/other_agencies.html\"> other space\nagencies</A> at almost every space agency's Web site.  Also, joint\nresearch projects or missions are given a prominent place on Web site. One\nexample of this is the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.nasa.gov/hqpao/hqpao_home.html\">NASA Public Affairs\nPage</A> where one finds information on NASA's mission, and its\nbeginnings.  Another example is found in Italy at the\n<A HREF=\"http://hp835.mt.asi.it/00HTL/asi.html\"> Agenzia Spaziale\nItaliana</A>, where you will find information about the goals of the space\nagency, and their current missions, as well as information about their\ncooperation with the <A HREF=\"http://www.esrin.esa.it/\">European Space\nAgency.</A>\n<H6><A HREF=\"#table\">Table of Contents</A></H6>\n<H3><A NAME=\"coop\">Space Cooperation: Get There and Back with \nMaximal Efficiency</A></H3>\n<P>\nWe have come a long way from the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/history/astp/astp.html\">Apollo-Soyuz \nTest Project</A> which was the first international manned spaceflight \n(in this case, between the Soviet space agency and NASA). The project \nwas more \nof a test to look into the similarities and differences between the spacecraft\nand space programs, and less of a cooperation between the political entities\nof the the Soviet Union and the United States. The two space agencies \nwere looking into the possibilities of using each other's spacecraft for \nrescue missions, and also for potential future space missons. The 25 \nyear anniversary of this historic mission will be July 15-20, 1995. The \nastronauts may have only shared a few moments, some food, and the fitting \nof two halves of a medallion together, but these gestures led the U.S. \nand the then Soviet Union that much closer to cooperation in space \nflight.\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/history/astp/astp-goals.txt\">(ASTP goals)</A>\n<P>\nWhile the two superpowers of the time, the Soviet Union and the US, were \nbusy trying to feel out each other's capabilities, and still remain \ncompetitive, the\n<A HREF=\"ftp://ns3.hq.eso.org/pub/un/un-homepage.html\">United Nations Office \nfor Outer Space Affairs</A> realized that the launch of Sputnik by the\nby the Soviet Union in 1957, and the subsequent &quot;space race&quot; it \nhad started, would lead nations to possible conflicts in space. An ad \nhoc committee was created in 1958, and became an official committee at the \nUnited Nations in 1959. This committee has set out to establish rules and \nregulations that will help keep space a peaceful place, as well as \nrecognize that astronauts are impartial human explorers. They are not \ninvolved in conflict, and if they should land in another country, \nthey should be returned to their nation of origin. Cooperation was, \nand has become something important, something to preserve our world \nand also keep space free for all to study and explore.\n<P>\nOne of the latest examples of cooperation was &quot;launched&quot; on \nMarch 14, 1995, just a few days before starting on this paper, \nand is one of the most exciting joint missions between the US and Russia: \nthe launch \nof a <A HREF=\"http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/calendar/tm21.html\">\nRussian Soyuz TM-21 Rocket to their Mir Space Station.</A>\nThis is the first Russian (or Soviet, if the Soviet Union were \nstill intact) mission ever to carry an American Astronaut into \nspace. Two Cosmonauts, and Dr. Norman E. Thagard, an American \nastronaut, will conduct experiments aboard Mir, and will return to \nEarth aboard Space Shuttle mission\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-71/mission-sts-71.html\">\nSTS-71</A>, when the Space Shuttle will dock with Mir for the first \ntime ever.\n(Photo of Russian\n<A HREF=\"http://spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov/NASA.Projects/International.Cooperation/U.S.-Russian.Cooperative.Projects/STS-71.Mir.Docking.Mission/Mission.Images/Russian.Docking.Mechanism.gif\">\nDocking Mechanism on Mir</A> Space Station.)\n<P>\n<H6><A HREF=\"#table\">Table of Contents</A></H6>\n<H3><A NAME=\"colony\">The Ultimate Flight: A Journey to New \nColonies</A></H3>\nThis will be the ultimate form of cooperation possible between the \nnations of the Earth and their space programs. The mission to dock \nwith Mir is the first step in creating\n<A HREF=\"http://issa-www.jsc.nasa.gov/ss/prgview/prgview.html\">\nSpace Station Alpha</A>, a joint, multinational space station. Part \nof the reason for this cooperative effort is that Mir is already in \nspace and it is  an ideal &quot;stepping stone&quot; for building \nanother space station. It can support life for extended periods of \ntime, and can be resupplied with relative ease by the American Space \nShuttle. The Americans need something pre-established, while the \nRussians need \ncash (as &quot;rent?&quot;) and other countries are willing to pay to \nhave a lab for potentially ground-breaking research.\n<P>\nWhen the space station is completed, the next step will be to create \na colony on some other planet, or at least on another space station. \nThoughts about this are already in the works.\nA <A HREF=\"http://www.nas.nasa.gov/NAS/SpaceSettlement/\">\nspace settlement</A> will probably be a joint effort to keep costs \ndown in these harder economic times. It will also be a new experience \nfor cultural exchange and interaction in a smaller community. \nCivilians will eventually colonize, and a community with fewer \npersonal barriers will hopefully form.\n<H6><A HREF=\"#table\">Table of Contents</A></H6>\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/icons/thinbar.gif\">\n<H2><A NAME=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</A></H2>\nMan may not have wings, but the birds still wonder what the heck jet \nplanes are, and we still gawk in awe when the Space Shuttle is \nlaunched on another misson. Man has taken to the skies, and there is \nlittle chance we will ever be grounded again. We can fly in the worst \nweather with sophisticated computers, and we have been able to put \nmen on the moon. Where we will go next, and what planet we will \ncolonize, or orbit with a space station, no one yet knows. But we are \nno longer an earth-bound species and the future lies in the sky.\n<P>\n<IMG SRC=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/icons/thinbar.gif\">\n<H3><A NAME=\"myths\">Favorite Myths About Being Lightheaded While...</A></H3>\n<DL>\n<DD><B>At a Computer Terminal:</B> Cars are not the only things that \ncrash.\n<DD><B>In The Air:</B> Fish will swim in air at high altitudes.\n<DD><B>In Space:</B> You can't get there from here.\n<DD><B>On The moon:</B> It is made of brie cheese.\n</DL>\n<IMG SRC=\"http://iconnect.com/jordan/icons/thinbar.gif\"> \n\n<H3>Return to the <A HREF=\"#table\">Table of Contents</A></H3>\n\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/assignment-4.html>\nAssignment #4,</A>\nsubmitted March 18, 1995 for\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nInformation and Computer Sciences 1C</A> at the\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cwis.uci.edu/\">University of California, Irvine</A><BR>\n<LI>Send Comments and Questions regarding this document to:\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/hw3/11.html\">\n<ADDRESS>Sepehr Khonsari</A> \n&lt;eabu319@ea.oac.uci.edu&gt;</ADDRESS>\n<B>AND/OR</B>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/hw3/34.html\">\n<ADDRESS>Ellen King</A> &lt;eaaa045@ea.oac.uci.edu&gt;</ADDRESS>\n</UL>\n\n</BODY> \n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
