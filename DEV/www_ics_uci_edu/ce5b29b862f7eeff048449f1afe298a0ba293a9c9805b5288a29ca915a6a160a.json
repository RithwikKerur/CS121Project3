This even applies to writing programs:  A pair of programmers\n(working as described here) nearly always beats the stereotypical solitary\nloner.  The pair produces more high-quality code in less time, by far more\nthan two-to-one.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>In pair programming, two programmers share\none computer.  One is the &quot;driver,&quot; who controls the keyboard\nand mouse.  The other is the &quot;navigator,&quot; who observes, asks questions,\nsuggests solutions, and thinks about slightly longer-term strategies.  The\ntwo programmers switch roles frequently</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">&mdash;</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>every 15 minutes would be a good\ninterval for us, though that&#39;s flexible.  Even the activities of the\ndriver and navigator are flexible (except for who does the typing); the\ngoal is to work collaboratively, each partner assisting the other as needed,\nto produce the best joint result possible.  It is not pair programming if\none person does all the work or if the partners just split up the work and\neach does half independently.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>That&#39;s the basic idea:  Spend your time in the scheduled labs working with your partner,\none of you as driver and the other as navigator, switching regularly.  You\nmay need to arrange other times to meet, beyond the scheduled lab sections.\n We expect everyone to be as flexible and professional as possible in arranging\nthose times as necessary; if your schedule is highly constrained, explore\npossible outside meeting times with your prospective partners before you commit to the partnership.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>You may enjoy reading this paper about pair\nprogramming:  <A HREF=\"http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=332848&type=pdf&coll=ACM&dl=ACM&CFID=12916017&CFTOKEN=16268370\">All I Really Need to Know About Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten</A>,\nby Laurie A. Williams and Robert R. Kessler (<I>Communications of the ACM,</I>\nMay 2000).  <A HREF=\"http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Kindergarten.PDF\">[Alternate link]</A>\n</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>What about individual differences?  </B>People\nnew to pair programming often ask what happens if the members of the pair\nhave different abilities.  Actually, that is true of any pair of people\nin the world, probably even including identical twins.  The differences\nmay be great or small, one member may have more strengths than the other,\nbut this is exactly like most real-world working situations.  Part of accomplishing\na task is to get the most out of each member and make each member stronger\nand more productive on subsequent tasks.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>A clearly stronger partner may feel frustrated\nor slowed down by the other partner, but the stronger partner still benefits\nfrom the teamwork in many ways: The other partner&#39;s requests for clarification\noften point out flaws in the approach or solution, the teamwork skills gained\nhave great value in the job market, and the exercise of providing a clear\nexplanation solidifies and deepens the explainer&#39;s own understanding.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>The less strong partner may feel that questions\nhold the other partner back or that there is no benefit to participating\nactively, but pair programming studies show that paired work is consistently\nbetter than work the stronger partner does individually.  It is part of\neach partner&#39;s job to understand the whole task; that means asking questions\nwhen necessary and answering them when possible.</FONT></P>\n<P><font size=\"4\" face=\"Garamond\">You will choose a different partner for every assignment, so your partners' skill levels are certain to vary from week to week. Still, when you have a choice, you should try to pick a partner whose skill level is close to your own. This won't always be possible, and it's sometimes hard to compare skill levels at all, but we find that pairs are most productive when the partners are at about the same level. </font></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>How does this affect my grade?</B>  Of\ncourse the expectation in ICS H21 is that everyone will get a grade in the\nA range.  Participation in pair programming won&#39;t be the cause of any\nlow grades.  (Failure to participate fully and cooperatively, on the other\nhand, could be a problem.)</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>On assignments that specify pair programming,\neach pair will submit one solution, marked with both partners&#39; names.\n (For electronic submissions via Checkmate, just one member of the pair\nshould submit the solution, which should still contain both partners&#39;\nnames; we&#39;ll keep track of who&#39;s in what pair, so long as you keep\nus informed of your pairings in the first place.)  Each pair will receive\na single score on the assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>Also, for each paired assignment, each student\nindividually will submit a brief partner evaluation form, administered electronically,\nwhich will ask these questions:  Did your partner come to the scheduled\nmeetings on time and ready to work?  Did your partner read the assignment\nand preparatory materials before coming to the scheduled meetings, showing up wither with specific questions or ready to contribute?  Did\nyour partner cooperatively follow the pair programming model (rotating roles\nof driver and navigator, questioning and making observations as the navigator)?\n Did your partner contribute fully, fairly, and actively, to the best of his or her ability, to the completion\nof the lab assignment?  Was your partner&#39;s participation professional\nand cooperative overall?  </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT size=\"4\" FACE=\"Garamond\">Filling out the evaluation is required of each\nstudent for each assignment; forgetting the evaluation won't help your grade. We haven&#39;t yet determined exactly how the evaluations will be factored\ninto assignment scores or grades:  We hope and expect that everyone&#39;s\nresponses will be positive, in which case it won&#39;t make much difference,\nbut we will be looking for recurring negative evaluations.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>It may be instructive to read a selection\nof students&#39; <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/evalcomments.html\">partner evaluation comments</A>\nfrom a previous course; they give a picture of what good partnerships are\nlike (and a few disasters, too).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>Additional information:</B>  Pair programming\nis one aspect of the trendily-named programming methodology Extreme Programming.\n A search for &quot;pair programming&quot; or &quot;extreme programming&quot;\non the Web will yield many references.</FONT></P>\n<HR>\n<span class=\"style4\"><span class=\"style1\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/\">David G.
