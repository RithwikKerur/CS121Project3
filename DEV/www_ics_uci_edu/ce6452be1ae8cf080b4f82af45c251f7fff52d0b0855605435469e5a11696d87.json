Most people can tell you that \nanthropology deals with the exotic ways of the worlds people, that \nanthropology is a sort of record of different ethnic and cultural \ngroups, and that anthropologists also study human evolution. It is \nbecause of this latter aspect of the field that people often comment to \nthe effect of \"oh anthropology, so are you going to go digging in the \ndeserts of Africa?\" And while archaeology is, in fact, a facet of \nanthropology, they are not one in the same. In fact, anthropology is \nactually such a wide-ranging field that at times it becomes difficult to \nclassify. <p>     \nIn an introduction to anthropology course, one is often taught that the \ndiscipline can be generally divided into four categories. These are \ncultural (includes social anthropology-these are sometimes seperate \ncategories) anthropology, physical or biological anthropology, archaeology, \nand linguistics. Here, cultural anthropology is meant to define the \nstudy of various cultures and their unique characteristics, both cultural \nand social. Physical \nanthropology is the study of human evolution. Archaeology defines the \nsystematic recovery and scientific study of material evidence remaining from \npast human cultures, and linguistics encompasses the study of human languages \nincluding grammer and technical relationships. However useful these categories\nmay be, I believe it will soon become evident that anthropology is actually \nmuch farther reaching.<p>    \n\nIn this paper I would like to present an overview of many of the more \nspecialized fields within the discipline and focus on one of them in \nparticular-ethnomusicology. This will not be an exhaustive look at the \ndifferent subcategories of anthropology, but instead, will be designed to \ngive an idea as to the vastness of the field.<p>\n\n<H2>An Overview</H2>\nThe specialized fields of anthropology are, in general, extensions of the \nfour categories mentioned above. However, the more detailed or limited in \nscope a specialized field becomes, the more it seems to combine not only \nthese different categories but also it begins to incorporate different \ndisciplines entirely.<a href=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/v-lib/anthropology.html\"> \nThe World-Wide Web Virtual Library anthropology section</a> gives a good \nidea as to the depth that anthropological specialized fields contain.<p>\n\nBeginning with an example which would loosely be placed under the \ncategory cultural anthropology, we can look at <a \nhref=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~cjp/rees.html\"> Russian and East European Studies\n</a>. This extensive study covers cultural, political, social, and linguistic \nissues. For instance, one can take a \"virtual museum tour\" of the \nTreasures of the Czars, look at population statistics, or look at a map of \nthe Commonwealth of Independent States. Also, there are links to political \nissues such as the <a \nhref=\"http://www.umd.umich.edu:80/dept/armenian/\">Armenian \nReasearch Center</a> which covers Armenian history, \ngenocide, and the current stuggle in Nagorno-Karabagh. The linguistics \nresource area covers many Russian and East European languages such as \nEstonian, Slovenian, and Russian. Clearly, this study combines at least \nthree of the categories mentioned above.<p>\n\nLikewise, <a href=\"http://coombs.anu.edu.au/WWWVL-AsianStudies.html\">Asian \nStudies</a> programs are also broadening. One can \nfind extensive information concerning the Asian continent, language and \nliterature, art, and Asian religions including <a \nhref=\"http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/\">Islam</a> and <a \nhref=\"http://www.psu.edu/jbe/resource.html\"> Buddhism</a>. A very \nmodern area of research in cultural anthropology concerns gangs. I found \nan interesting document in this area entitled <a \nhref=\"http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/elab/buidoi/vietgangs.html\"><i> Life in a \nVietnamese Gang</i></a>. This study began as a film at the University of \nSouthern California and is about a 20 year old Vietnamese guy named Richy Phan\nwho gets involved with a gang here in Orange County. I found this document \nparticularly interesting as it includes gang poetry and a letter from Richy \nPhan in jail. Also, this study is a good example of contemporary cultural \nanthropology mixing traditional techniques with film.\n\n<p><a href=\"http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/langs.html\"> \nLinguistics</a> is the one subcategory of anthropology that is the \nmost straight forward. It is generally studied by linguists, although \nanthropologists frequently collect the information, and is usually \nrestricted to the study of one language although there are also \ncomparative studies. At the same time, human evolution, which is just one \nof the\nsubcategories of anthropology, has itself many facets. Under the area of\n<a href=\"http://golgi.harvard.edu/biopages/evolution.html\"> Evolution</a>\nin the WWW Virtual Library anthropology section several of these facets\nare listed. From this document human evolution seems to cover not only the\nstudy of primate and human development across time, but also includes\nbiochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and ecology to mention a few. \nSo it seems that human evolution, like so many other areas of\nanthropology, combines with other disciplines in its studies. <p> \n\nAlthough the examples above give an idea as to the incorporated \nsubcategories and disciplines that anthropological studies entail, it is \neasier to get an idea of the multiple areas of anthropology by \nvisiting a few of these specialized or limited areas of study. \n<UL>\n<LI>\n<a href=\"http://spirit.lib.uconn.edu/ArchNet/Topical/Ethno/Ethno.html\">\nEthnoarchaeology and Ethnohistory</a> is an interesting field \ndealing with the archaeology and history of specific ethnic groups. This \nsite includes documents which are ethnic historical and documents on the \ninterpretation of specific archaeological finds.\n<LI><a href=\"http://webnet.com.au/koori/homekori.html\"> The Australian \nIndigenous Populations Study</a> is a sight that incorporates traditional \ncultural anthropology such as social control and cultural resilience with \nother displines such as law (aboriginal land rights), history, and fine \narts. </UL>   \n\n<H2>Ethnomusicology</H2>\n\nEthnomusicology is a specialized field of anthropology which combines \ncultural anthropology and music. This limited area of study is unique in \nthat it is not offered at many universities and in that it requires some \nbackground knowledge in the <a \nhref=\"http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjpm/class/elements.html\"> elements of \nmusic</a>, such as pitch, rhythm, melody, and harmony. The \nanthropological aspect of this area comes into play with the collection \nof data. Anthropologists, in this case ethnomusicologists, will collect \nthe relevant data (music) by using a classic cultural anthropology \ntechnique called field study. With a field study, the researcher will \nactually physically go to the place of interest (ex. Iran), stay for a \nfair period of time (often 6 months to 2 years), and collect information \nby personal interview. During this time the researcher will learn the \nlanguage and cultural features of the given country, become friendly with \nthe people, and conduct his/her investigative study.<p>\n\nStudies in ethnomusicology try to study and understand the music of \ndifferent ethnic groups in the context of that group's cultural \ncharaceristics and traits. They ask questions such as, for instance, \n\"what element of African tribal culture makes their music abundant in \nslow beating drum rythms?\" Although the focus of these types of studies \nare on the music rather than the culture, the culture is, of course, an \ninfluential factor in that music. <p>\n\nStudies in ethnomusicology have been conducted on many different \ncountries and ethnic groups within those countries (ex. studies on \nJewish music within Turkish culture). For example, studies have been done \non the music of <a \nhref=\"http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjpm/class/latin.html\"> \nLatin America</a>,<a \nhref=\"http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjpm/class/africa.html\"> \nSubsaharan Africa</a>, and <a \nhref=\"http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mfjpm/class/India.html\"> India</a>. \nThese studies \noften focus on the non-Western elements of the music and compare these \nelements to Western standards. Also, these type of studies often focus \non the religious music of the culture and its influence on the popular \nstyle. In fact, studies in ethnomusicology have amounted steadily and \nthere is now a Web site called <a \nhref=\"http://umbc7.umbc.edu/~signell/efhm/index.html\"> \nEthnoForum/hypermedia</a> that deals exclusively with ethnomusicology.<p>\n\nSince ethnomusicology is such an unusual and concentrated area of study, \nit is best to browse through one of these studies to get an idea as to \ntheir content and form. An excellent comprehensive example of an \nethnomusicological study is entitled <a \nhref=\"http://www.reg.uci.edu/UCI/FACULTY/RGARFIAS/BURMA/burma1.html\"><i> \nThe Burmese Piano Music of V KO KO</i></a> and was done by Prof. Robert \nGarfias \nhere at UCI. This study includes historical context, musical style and \nframework, and the characteristics of that specific cultures musical \nfacets. It is well worth it to visit this site and gain an \nunderstanding as to the fundamentals of ethnomusicology research. \n    \n\n<H2>Conclusion</H2>\nI think that anthropology has been affected positively by the World-Wide Web. \nIt has given the field an avenue to public awareness and it has given \nanthropologists a way to stay on top of recent research. In conclusion, \nanthropology was not always such a wide ranging area of study. If fact, at \nits inseption it was a fairly narrow field, limited to matters of human \nevolution and traditional cultural studies. However, anthropology is now a \ndiscipline which has not only broadened in scope in recent years, but \ncontinues to grow.  \n\n<H3>References:</H3>\n<OL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.usc.edu/dept/v-lib/anthropology.html\"> \nhttp://www.usc.edu/dept/v-lib/anthropology.html</A><BR> World-Wide Web \nVirtual Library: Anthropology\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/\"> \nhttp://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/</A><BR> Islam's Home Page\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.psu.edu/jbe/resource.html\"> \nhttp://www.psu.edu/jbe/resource.html</A><BR>Journal of Buddhist Ethics  \n<LI><A HREF=\"http://cwis.usc.edu/dept/elab/buidoi/vietgangs.html\"> \nhttp://cwis.usc.edu/dept/elab/buidoi/vietgangs.html</A><BR>Life in a \nVietnamese Gang\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/langs.html\"> \nhttp://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/langs.html</A><BR>Languages and \nLinguistics\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://webnet.com.au/koori/homekori.html\"> \nhttp://webnet.com.au/koori/homekori.html</A><BR> Internet Interface \nSystems Pty Ltd-Australian Indigenous Populations\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://umbc7.umbc.edu/~signell/efhm/index.html\"> \nhttp://umbc7.umbc.edu/~signell/efhm/index.html</A><BR> EthnoForum/hypermedia\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.reg.uci.edu/UCI/FACULTY/RGARFIAS/BURMA/burma1.html\"> \nhttp://www.reg.uci.edu/UCI/FACULTY/RGARFIAS/BURMA/burma1.html</A><BR> \nMusic of U Ko Ko by Prof. Robert Garfias</OL> \n<!--------===========CUT===HERE=========-------------->\n\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
