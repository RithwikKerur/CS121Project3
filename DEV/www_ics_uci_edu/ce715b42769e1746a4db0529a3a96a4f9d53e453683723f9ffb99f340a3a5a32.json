It&#39;s\neven harder if you&#39;re not doing it in your native language.  But you\ncan still communicate effectively if you apply these strategies:</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Speak slowly.  Your students will have more\ntime to understand what you&#39;re saying and you&#39;ll have more time\nto choose your words.  It&#39;s fine to be silent for a few seconds, too;\npauses let students catch up.</FONT><BR>\n<BR>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Look at your students.  By maintaining eye\ncontact, you can see if your students are following along as you speak.</FONT><BR>\n<BR>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Welcome students&#39; questions on any topic.\n If your students know that you&#39;re willing to answer questions, they&#39;ll\nhelp you be clearer by letting you know when you aren&#39;t.</FONT><BR>\n<BR>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Write a short outline of your presentation\non the board in advance (or use overhead transparency slides or computer-based\nslides).  This helps students follow along.</FONT><BR>\n<BR>\n</LI>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Write each key term on the board (or use slides).\n Also, make particularly sure that you have the correct pronunciation of\nthe key terms you&#39;re teaching about.  Check with a native English speaker\nin your field and practice those words especially.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Developing fluency in a second language doesn&#39;t\nhappen overnight; it&#39;s a developmental process that occurs over many\nyears.  Nobody should expect to speak like a TV announcer right away.  Nonetheless,\nyou can accelerate the development of your skills by taking every opportunity\nto exercise them:  Spend a lot of time (both social and academic) with colleagues\nwho are native English speakers.  Listen to English television and radio.\n Even reading the newspaper in English will help develop your language skills.\n Adults often feel embarrassed when they can&#39;t speak as well in their\nsecond language as they can in their native language, but despite those\nfeelings, you should take every opportunity to use English in conversation.\n As you do this, you will become more comfortable in the classroom and a\nmore effective teacher.</FONT></P>\n<BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
