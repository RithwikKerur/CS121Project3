This even applies to writing programs:  A pair of programmers\n(working as described here) nearly always beats the stereotypical solitary\nloner.  The pair produces more high-quality code in less time, by far more\nthan two-to-one.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">In pair programming, two programmers share\none computer.  One is the &quot;driver,&quot; who controls the keyboard\nand mouse.  The other is the &quot;navigator,&quot; who observes, asks questions,\nsuggests solutions, and thinks about slightly longer-term strategies.  The\ntwo programmers switch roles frequently&mdash;every 15 minutes would be a good\ninterval for us, though that&#39;s flexible.  Even the activities of the\ndriver and navigator are flexible (except for who does the typing); the\ngoal is to work collaboratively, each partner assisting the other as needed,\nto produce the best joint result possible.  It is not pair programming if\none person does all the work or if the partners just split up the work and\neach does half independently.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">That&#39;s the basic idea:  Spend your time in the scheduled labs working with your partner,\none of you as driver and the other as navigator, switching regularly.  You\nmay need to arrange other times to meet, beyond the scheduled lab sections.\n We expect everyone to be as flexible and professional as possible in arranging\nthose times as necessary; if your schedule is highly constrained, explore\npossible outside meeting times with your prospective partners before you commit to the partnership.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">You may enjoy reading this paper about pair\nprogramming:  <A HREF=\"http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=332848&type=pdf&coll=ACM&dl=ACM&CFID=12916017&CFTOKEN=16268370\">All I Really Need to Know About Pair Programming I Learned in Kindergarten</A>,\nby Laurie A. Williams and Robert R. Kessler (<I>Communications of the ACM,</I>\nMay 2000).  <A HREF=\"http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/Kindergarten.PDF\">[Alternate link]</A></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><strong>What about individual differences? </strong>People new to pair programming often ask what\nhappens if the members of the pair have different abilities.  Actually,\nthat is true of any pair of people in the world, probably even including\nidentical twins.  The differences may be great or small, one member may\nhave more strengths than the other, but this is exactly like most real-world\nworking situations.  Part of accomplishing a task is to get the most out\nof each member and make each member stronger and more productive on subsequent\ntasks.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">A clearly stronger partner may feel frustrated\nor slowed down by the other partner, but the stronger partner still benefits\nfrom the teamwork in many ways: The other partner&#39;s requests for clarification\noften point out flaws in the approach or solution, the teamwork skills gained\nhave great value in the job market, and the exercise of providing a clear\nexplanation solidifies and deepens the explainer&#39;s own understanding.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">The less strong partner may feel that questions\nhold the other partner back or that there is no benefit to participating\nactively, but pair programming studies show that paired work is consistently\nbetter than work the stronger partner does individually.  It is part of\neach partner&#39;s job to understand the whole task; that means asking questions\nwhen necessary and answering them when possible.</FONT></P>\n<P><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">You will choose a different partner for every assignment, so your partners' skill levels are certain to vary from week to week. Still, when you have a choice, you should try to pick a partner whose skill level is close to your own. This won't always be possible, and it's sometimes hard to compare skill levels at all, but we find that pairs are most productive when the partners are at about the same level&mdash;there's a more balanced give-and-take.</font></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><strong>How does this affect my grade? </strong>Participation in pair programming won't be the cause of any low grades. (Failure to participate fully and cooperatively, on the other hand, could be a problem.) On assignments that specify pair programming,\n  each pair will submit one solution, marked with both partners&#39; names.\n  (For electronic submissions via Checkmate, just one member of the pair\n  should submit the solution, which should still contain both partners&#39;\n  names at the top of the file; we&#39;ll keep track of who&#39;s in what pair, so long as you keep\n  us informed of your pairings in the first place.)  Each pair will receive\n  a single score on the assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Also, for each paired assignment, each student\nindividually will submit a brief partner evaluation form, administered electronically,\nwhich will ask these questions:  Did your partner come to the scheduled meetings on time and ready to work? Did your partner read the assignment and preparatory materials before coming to the scheduled meetings, showing up either with specific questions or ready to contribute? Did your partner cooperatively follow the pair programming model (rotating roles of driver and navigator, questioning and making observations as the navigator)? Did your partner contribute fully, fairly, and actively, to the best of his or her ability, to the completion of the lab assignment? Was your partner's participation professional and cooperative overall?</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Filling out the evaluation is required of each\nstudent for each assignment; forgetting the evaluation will lower your participation\nscore. </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">We will tally these evaluation scores and use them in computing the\nparticipation part of the grade (taking care that nobody&#39;s score is\nhurt by a single bad partnership or a selection of partners that happen\nto give low scores).  <!--We may also give you a small bonus if your partner\ndoes particularly well on the following week&#39;s quiz; we have yet to\nwork out the details, but this should be an added incentive to master the\nmaterial as a team.-->\n<!-- -->\n</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">It may be instructive to read a selection of\nstudents&#39; <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/evalcomments.html\">partner evaluation comments</A>\nfrom a previous course; they give a picture of what good partnerships are\nlike (and a few disasters, too).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><strong>Additional information: </strong>Pair programming is one aspect of the trendily-named\nprogramming methodology Extreme Programming.
