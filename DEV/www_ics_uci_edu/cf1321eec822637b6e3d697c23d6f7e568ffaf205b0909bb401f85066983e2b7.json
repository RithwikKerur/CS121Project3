The same holds for Assignment 5. And each choice is independent: for example, you can work alone on Assignment 4 and work with a partner on Assignment 5, or work alone on both, or have a partner on both. You are responsibile for finding your partner(s).</p>\n\n<p>If you do work in a programming team, that team turns in one, jointly-done programming assignment; do make sure both members' names and ID numbers are included in comments at the start of the code. Obviously, if you work alone on the assignment, you turn in your own assignment, written solely by you.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you work alone or in a team, do remember to follow the course academic honesty rules as discussed in the Course Reference.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<div class=\"history\">\nWritten by Norman Jacobson, September, 2006; the section on partner evaluation was adapted\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; from text in <i>Informatics 41 Fall 2006 Pair Programming Guidelines</i> \n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;by David G.
