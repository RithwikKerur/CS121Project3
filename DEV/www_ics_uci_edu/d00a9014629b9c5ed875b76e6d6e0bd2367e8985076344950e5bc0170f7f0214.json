The first\nis the ability to transition a device or system into a sleep state\nif it is idle. The trade-off is that a fixed amount of energy is\nneeded to transition the device back into an active state in which\nit can begin to process jobs. We extend previous work on this problem\nand develop online algorithms for devices with multiple levels of\nsleep states. Each sleep state has a different power consumption level\nand different cost in transitioning back to the active state.\n\nThe second way in which power savings can be achieved is by varying\nthe speed at which jobs are run. We utilize a power consumption curve \nwhich indicates the power consumption level given a particular speed. \nThe problem is to schedule arriving jobs in a way that minimizes total\nenergy use so that each job is completed by its deadline. Our work \naddresses systems whose speed can be varied and which have a sleep state. \nWe devise both offline and online algorithms for this problem.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
