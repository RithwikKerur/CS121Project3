Our\nstructure allows the number of key-value pairs to greatly exceed this\nthreshold during normal operation. Exceeding the threshold simply\ntemporarily prevents content listing and reduces the probability of a\nsuccessful lookup. If later entries are deleted to return the structure\nbelow the threshold, everything again functions appropriately. We also\nshow that simple variations of our structure are robust to certain\nstandard errors, such as the deletion of a key without a corresponding\ninsertion or the insertion of two distinct values for a key. The\nproperties of our structure make it suitable for several applications,\nincluding database and networking applications that we highlight.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on a preprint by Goodrich and Mitzenmacher, <a\nhref=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2245\">arXiv:1101.2245</a>.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
