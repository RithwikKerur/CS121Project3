This problem is known to be NP-complete. We consider\nnatural restrictions of this problem where constraints are placed on the\npossible orientations of edges. In particular, we show that if each edge\nhas prescribed direction \"left\", \"right\", \"down\" or \"up\", the problem of\nfinding a rectilinear drawing is polynomial, while finding such a drawing\nwith the minimum area is NP-complete. When assigned directions are\n\"horizontal\" or \"vertical\" or a cyclic order of the edges at each vertex\nis specified, the problem is NP-complete. We show that these two\nNP-complete cases are fixed parameter tractable in the number of vertices\nof degree 3 or 4.\n\n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
