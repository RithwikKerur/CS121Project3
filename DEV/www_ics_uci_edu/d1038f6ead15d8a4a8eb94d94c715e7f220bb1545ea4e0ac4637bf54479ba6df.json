Given a point w, allegedly on the wheel,\none can construct two more points w_1 and w_2 on the wheel by drawing lines\nof length L from w through p and w through q.  Repeating this process,\nyou can make a computer drawing of (lots of) points which must\nlie on the wheel W to be consistent with the data (w,p,q,L).\nBy starting with points w very close to the line through p and q,\nyou can generate continua which must lie in W.  These continua\ntend to be non-locally connected, due to incoherence between\nstable and unstable manifolds in this dynamical system\n(a well-known phenomena).  I suspect this can be made into a proof\nthat there is no wheel with two axes.  It should be considerably\nsimpler with the assumption that the wheel is star-shaped from\np and q.  But perhaps the discussion is \"academic\", since a solution\nof a large portion of the problem appears in:\n\n@article{Schafke:Volkmer,\n\tkey=\"SV\",\n\tauthor={R. Sch\\\"afke and H.
