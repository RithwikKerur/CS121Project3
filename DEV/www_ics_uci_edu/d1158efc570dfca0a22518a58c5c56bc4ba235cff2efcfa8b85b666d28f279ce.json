You will need to find out what the instructor expects you to\ndo, make sure there aren&#39;t any insurmountable scheduling conflicts,\nand begin to prepare for your teaching assignment.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\"><B>In advance &mdash; </B>There are some things you can\nfind out  by yourself in advance:</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">When and where does the class meet?</FONT><font face=\"Garamond\"><BR />\n  </font></LI>\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">When and where do the discussion and lab sections\nmeet?</FONT>\n  <font face=\"Garamond\"><em>Check these using the <A HREF=\"http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/\">on-line schedule of  classes</A>\n(<A HREF=\"http://websoc.reg.uci.edu/\">http://websoc.reg.uci.edu</A>);\ntimes and rooms often change, and sometimes\nas late as the first week of classes.</em></font></LI>\n<LI><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">Do the lectures or sections conflict with your own classes or other obligations? <em>You may need to make adjustments once you know what your TA duties involve.</em></FONT><font face=\"Garamond\"><BR />\n</font></LI>\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">How has this instructor (or other instructors) organized\nthis course in the past?</FONT>\n  <font face=\"Garamond\"><em>Most instructors&#39; home pages have links to syllabi\n(and sometimes other materials) for the courses they teach.  A few minutes\nspent looking at these will give you a good outline of the course&#39;s\norganization (though of course things may change from one quarter to the\nnext).</em><BR />\n  </font></LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\"><B>Asking the instructor &mdash; </B>The questions listed\nhere apply to a broad range of courses and go into some detail.  You shouldn&#39;t\nexpect the instructor to provide absolute, definitive answers to all of\nthese questions.  It&#39;s impossible to predict every task that may need\ndoing during the quarter, and it&#39;s important to be flexible as the needs\nof the class become clearer over time.  Instructors may prefer to let you\nresolve some of these issues yourself, or in consultation with other TAs\nor readers for the course.  Nonetheless, the sooner you get answers to any\nof these questions, the better you can plan and prepare and the better you\ncan balance your teaching responsibilities with your other obligations.</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\">Attending lecture:  Do you prefer or require that\nI attend the lectures?
