One such concept\nis of being able to cancel an auction.  These cancelable auctions have the\nproperty that if the revenue collected does not meet a certain\npredetermined criteria, then the auction can be cancelled and still remain\ntruthful.  My talk will focus on these cancelable auctions.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
