The evaluation is due at the date and time given in the Course Schedule.</p>\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<h4>Evaluation Questions</h4>\n</div>\n\nTo evaluate your partner,\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Copy the form into the <i>body</i> of an email; do not make it as an attachment.</p></li>\n<li><p>Complete the evaluation. You can indicate your choice from various options by deleting all the options for the question except the one you want to pick. Answer the open-ended questions by simply typing in your repsonses.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make the subject of the email \"First Partner Evaluation\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Email the completed evaluation to <font class = \"codefacesmall\">21-questions@ics.uci.edu</font></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Although the open response questions are phrased to elicit a yes or no response, you are encouraged to include comments to elaborate on your answer; the goal is to paint us a picture of the nature of your partner&#146;s participation in paired work, and what you think about pair programming (so far). </p>\n\n<p>If you were given approval to work alone instead of in a pair, complete this evaluation about yourself as best as you can, revising it as necessary to make sense in that context. For example, the first question could be interpreted as &#147;Did you come to lab on time and ready to work?&#148;</p>\n<br><br>\n<center><b>Pair Partner Evaluation Form</b></center>\n<p>My Name:</p>\n\n<p>My UCI ID Number:</p>\n\n<p>My Partner's Name:</p>\n\n<p>My partner's technical competency is (choose one):</p>\n<pre>\n\tMuch better than mine\n\tSomewhat better than mine\n\tAbout the same as mine\n\tSomewhat less than mine\n\tMuch less than mine\n</pre>\n\n<p>My partner and I were _______ compatible (choose one option to fill the blank):</p>\n\n<pre>\n\tVery\n\tReasonably\n\tNot at all\n</pre>\n\n<p><b>Open response questions</b></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Did your partner come to the scheduled meetings on time and ready to work?

Your new partner cannot be your current partner, unless you took on a new partner after Lab Exam 2 was given; in that case, you and your current partner can remain partners for Labs 4 and 5, if you both agree.</p>\n\n<p> As before, we prefer you and your partner chose each other, asking for a TA&#146;s assistance if you cannot find a partner. Report the new partnership via email to <font class = \"codefacesmall\">21-questions@ics.uci.edu</font> no later than the date given in the Course Schedule. </p>\n\n<h4>Why the Switch</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Learning to work with different individuals is an important skill in general, and in the computer science workplace in particular; virtually all projects are accomplished by teams where membership changes ocassionally (and sometimes often).</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Sometimes one of a pair will drop the course, or stop participating in it, leaving the other person of the pair without a partner. Reforming pairs lets us correct that situation.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Switching gives you an opportunity to pair up with another who has passed (and not passed) the same, or close to the same, lab exams; we strongly recommend you take advantage of this opportunity.  Such a pairing puts together students who have (close to) the same tasks to complete, maximizing the benefit to both partners. \n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n<div class=\"history\">\nWritten by Norman Jacobson, September, 2006; the section on partner evaluation was adapted\n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; from text in <i>Informatics 41 Fall 2006 Pair Programming Guidelines</i> \n<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;by David G.
