I have spoken with him several times about the adventure and the situation could easily have turned tragic. Luckily everyone survived. His website <a href=\"http://www.photobits.com\" title=\"Eli Charne's website, Photobits.com\">Photobits.com</a> has photos, a blog, and other information about the adventure. All I know is that I won't be booking travel to Antartica any time soon and certainly not with the company he chose!</p> \n\n<p>As most of my friends know, I have had a fairly broad set of interests \nwhich I have enjoyed.  My long history here at UCI has provided me with many\nchances to extend myself into areas I would not have ventured into on my own.\nMany things are possible, and I am glad to have had a chance to explore many\npaths.\nRead on to learn more about the things I have done and still do for the most \npart.\n</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3>Academic</h3>\n\n<p>Well, my long torturous academic history has been one full of ups and \ndowns.  I like to think it was mostly a good thing (the path less\ntaken), although I know it was not something that most people can\nunderstand.\n</p>\n\n<p>An interesting thing to note is that number of successful people have \nfollowed the same path. I think my independence stems from the outlook I \ngained from Richard Feynman. I had a few lectures by him and he was amazing.\nHe would not advise you on how to live, but he say that following your interests\nleads to understand thing more deeply than you would otherwise. \n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>What I studied (short list):</b>\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Physics -- I wanted to work on Neutrino Physics.\n</li>\n<li>Philosophy -- I wanted to be a Phenomonologist. \n</li>\n<li>Art History -- I wanted to be an expert on 2Oth Century American Art, 19th Century\nEuropean Art, and Venetian Art.\n</li>\n<li>Computer Science -- I wanted to be a hypermedia expert.\n</li>\n<li>Ecology -- I wanted to work as a field biologist in the Eastern Sierra Nevada.\n</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n<h3>Sports</h3>\n<p>I raced for four season on the UCI Cycling Team. I raced both road and \ntrack. Cycling is a very dangerous sport and in the course of racing and training\nI suffered 3 concussions, 3 major fractures (pelvis, elbow, and wrist), and \nlarge number of soft tissue injuries. I have destroyed 2 bike frames, 4 wheels,\nand 6 helmets. (Not to mention the times I have been hit by cars.)\n</p>\n\n<p> But for all the bad, I still love it. I miss my teammates and I miss \ntraining 10,000 miles a year. Collegiate cycling is also very special\nbecause you race against the same people every week and you're representing\nyour school. This makes for a lot of comradarie. The conference UCI is\nin is the West Coast Cycling Conference of the\n        <a href=\"http://www.usacycling.org/ncca2/\">NCCA</a>,\n        the National Collegiate Cycling Association.  I also raced in the the\n        <b>USCF</b>,\n        the United States Cycling Federation, and trained\n        under some USCF coaches and occasionally trained at the\n        Olympic Velodrome.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>The Best Races were:</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mt. Baldy TT -- always in February, and always cold. 12% grade, snow falling,\nand the solitude of climbing alone. It's also a hoot to be watching the \nskiers and boarders (bundled up in their cars, and staring at you)\npassing you while you're riding like a maniac (\nsweating like pig, gasping for air, in shorts and short sleeves, and dancing on\nthe pedals).\n</li>\n<li>Glendora Mt. Road TT -- next weekend after Baldy, less elevation gain, and less steep but always \na challenge.\n</li>\n<li>Jamul RR -- tough, tough climbs and 50mph decents. One year the chase\nmotorcycle crashed because it could not hang on the same line we were on in the\ndownhill hairpins. In cold winters the snow melt in the spring makes streams \non the road -- frigid cold water makes you shiver to the bone but a very \n\"cool\" experience.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I also belong to <a href=\"http://www.team-internet.org/\">Team@Internet</a>, \nan international racing club made up of\na lot of people from the old Usenet rec.bicycles.racing news group. It's a good\ngroup of highly skilled people. Very proffessional group.\n</p>\n\n<hr /> \n<h3>Volunteer</h3>\n\n<p>I currently volunteer as a member of the Southern California Nordic Ski Patrol at Mt Pinos in the Los Padres National Forest. Our team has been recognized as the top nordic ski patrol 3 times by the National Ski Patrol. Our team is currently part of the California Office of Emergency Service's Winter SAR team. </p>\n<p>I used volunteer my time as a member of <a href=\"http://www.ocsr.org/\">Orange County Search and Rescue</a>. Unfortunately, the team disbanded in 2004! Part of the reason was trying to fit in with Homeland Security and having an agency to partner with. We had partnered with the Forest Service to patrol in the Clevland Nation Forest, Trabuco Ranger Distict. We would get basic wild land fire training every year so we could provide ground support during a fire.</p>\n<p>\n  My biggest regret so far has been my inability to save my friend Bill Bretz's home while we worked in support of the USFS fighting the 2001 Alpine Fire.  \n</p> \n\n<p>\nI used to volunteer my time to build houses for Habitat for Humanity, but I am running out of free time to do it. It is a good thing to be involved with so I encourage any who may be interested.  \n</p>\n\n<p>I now volunteer as a Nordic Backcountry Ski Patroler for the Mt. Pinos Ski \nPatrol. It's hard work, but the people I am with are great. One summitted Everest\nand a number have been to the top of Denali. \n</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3>Hobbies</h3>\n\n<p>I studied Art History (along with Computer Science) so I am a\nrather knowledgeable fellow on Venetian painters, 20th Century American Art,\nGreek and Roman Antiquities, and Impressionist artists. I am engaged in the \ndebate on the attribution of Pastorale or Concerts champetres (Louvre, Paris). \nMost people nowadays think it's Titian, but I think it is closer to \nGiorgione. \nFunny thing about all this is that my \ndepartment chair always thought I was better at sculpture analysis than \npainting or photography.\n</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of photography, I try to stay active in a creative medium by \nshooting photos. I am most interested in people, but I tend not to get\npeople to be subjects for me. I guess that's why I'm not a pro at this :-)\n</p>\n\n<p>I like a bunch of outdoor activities like skiing, hiking, SCUBA, and \nkayaking. \nWish I had time to do them more often :-(\n</p>\n\n<p>Another hobbie which may be more of a sport (or obsession) is Rock Climbing, \nwhich I seem to training for at a rate of 4 nights a week! I am glad to have \nstarted it up back again after retiring from it a while back. I really \nenjoy the people I climb with now, and hope to continue to improve.\n</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3>Friends</h3>\n\n<p>I have gotten to know a lot of people over time and I really feel proud to\nhave come in contact with some outstanding people. I'll just list a bunch that\ncome to mind: Julie Justus, Jim Kohlenberger, Kent Madson, Doug March, \nBabs Sandeen, Jakob and Eva Barden, Henrik Fragrell, D. Mason Kington, \nKaren Newman, Darby Ellison, Amy Sue Waldman, Alice Presley, Elizabetta\nDi Nitto, Neno Medvidovic, John Self, Jeffery Blevins, Heidi King, Margaret Mar, \nLilly Wang, Peter Bowler, Amy Osajima, Wendy Kohatsu, Boons, Brooke Jacobs, \nMary Inglish,\nThomas Kistler, Eli Charne, Peter Kammer, Matt and Leann Crib, \nDave DiGiorgio, Cecile,\nPeter De Barber, Urs Mader, Bill Bretz, Malcolm MacNiven, and Tammy McNulty. \n</p>\n\n<p>I know I am missing a lot of people on the list, but if you knew just\nhow plain good some of those listed are, then you wouldn't have watch\na TV show called \"Touched by and Angel\" anymore because you would know\nthat powerful goodness exists. Julie for instance used to work providing\nshelters for homeless families stuck on LA's skid row, and later worked\non assisting impoverished families in Venice Beach. \n</p>\n\n<p>Many of my friends are far away now, but I wish them all the best and \nhope that I can cultivate new relations which will be just as rewarding.\n</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h3>Fun Times</h3>\n<ul>\n<li> With the folks from the Supercourse on a <a href=\"bishop.html\">night out in Bishop </a>-- a super\ngroup of kids, all very talented and very good people.\n</li>\n<li> Some shots from Khoi Nguyen on a trip to <a href=\"death_valley_trip/\">Death Valley.</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n<h3>Places to Visit</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><img src=\"javalogo.gif\" height=\"96\" width=\"55\" alt=\"Sun Java logo\" /> Visit the Sun`s <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/\">\nJava</a> page.  Java is the hotest thing going on in the programming world\nright now.  A lot of hype, and hope for Java.\n</li>\n<li><img src=\"hac2.gif\"\nwidth=\"96\" height=\"45\" alt=\"Hughes Aircraft Co. logo\" /> Visit the \n<a href=\"http://www.hac.com/\">Hughes \nAircraft Company</a> home page.  \nI used to work on Sentinel, Fire-Finder, and SD projects at Hughes.  \nI enjoyed working with some fine engineers -- especially \n\"my people\" from Fullerton.  (Raytheon may own it, but Hughes Aircraft \nstill holds a place in our hearts.)\n</li>\n<li> I like books, so I encourage you to read as many as you can.  \nI think that books really do help to broaden your mind, so what better way\nto combat the \"dumbing down of America.\"  ( \nTheodore Roosevelt averaged reading 2 books a day as president!  \nI think that we could defintely\nmake time to read more in our lives.)\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.book.uci.edu/\">UCI's\nBookstore</a> was a pioneer store on the web.  Amazon and Barnes and Noble \nhave spent millions in making their sites. UCI can't compete with\nthose guys in terms of both buying power or computer power, so don't \nexpect too much.  It is a very nice store though.\n</p>\n\n</li>\n<li>I have a few friends working at the \n<a href=\"http://www.alz.uci.edu/\">\nAlzheimer's Clinic</a> at UCI.  It is properly titled the Institute for Brain\nAging and Dementia, check out the site if you are interested.\n</li>\n\n<li>For those intrested in volunteer outdoor service organizations, one \nwhich I train with is the local, \n<a href=\"http://members.aol.com/xcpatrl/index.html/FrameSet1.html\">Southern California Nordic</a> branch of the National \nSki Patrol.  The national page is here:<a href=\"http://www.nsp.org/\">\nNational Ski Patrol</a>.  But a more useful site the \n<a href=\"http://www.skipatrol.org/\">Ski Patrol</a> web-page which has more\nmedical, safety, and avalanche information.  \nCaveat, the site is oddly organized.  \n</li>\n</ul>\n<p/>\n\n<hr/>\n<address>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</a>\n\n<br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">University of California, Irvine</a>\nCA 92697\n</address>\n<p>\nLast modified: Thursday, 14 July 2005\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" valign=\"bottom\">\n      <a href=\"http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer\"><img\n          src=\"http://www.w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10\"\n          alt=\"Valid XHTML 1.0!\" height=\"31\" width=\"88\" /></a>\n</td>\n\n<td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n<address class=\"copyright\">Copyright &copy; 1996-2005\n</address>\n</td>\n\n<td align=\"right\" valign=\"bottom\">\n <a href=\"http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http://www.ics.uci.ed\nu/~yuzok/css1.css\">\n  <img style=\"border:0;width:88px;height:31px\"\n       src=\"http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss\"\n       alt=\"Valid CSS!\" />\n </a>\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.eff.org/blueribbon\"><img\nsrc=\"brstrip.gif\" alt=\"[Blue Ribbon Campaign icon]\"\nheight=\"41\" width=\"150\"/></a>\n</td>\n\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
