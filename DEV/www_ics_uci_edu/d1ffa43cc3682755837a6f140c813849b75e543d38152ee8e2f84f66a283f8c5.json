This class has no in-lecture exams; your grade is determined from how well you do on the project. </p>\n\n<p>Lecture is where we present an overview of each assignment, information you need to get\nstarted installing and using the tools needed for the project, and information\nabout database design and use relevant to FabFlixs development.  It will be held as needed; see the Course Calendar for details. During some lecture times ther will be additional office hours instead of a lecture; again, see the Course Calendar for details. There are no\ndiscussion or lab sections.</p>\n\n<p>The course TA, Setareh Rafatirad, will hold office hours, to be settled upon by week two of the quarter, to assist you with your project work.\nHe will also, along with the instructor, conduct the\nend of phase demonstrations (discussed below). Setareh also has\nresponsibility for the correct and timely recording of your assignment scores.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<a name=Prerequisites></a>\n<h3>Prerequisite</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>To be enrolled in CS122B, you must have taken CS122A or the cross-listed course EECS116 or &quot;the equivalent.&quot; &quot;The equivalent&quot; is a course from\nanother institution that was granted transfer subject credit here, or workplace\nor other experience that closely matches the material covered in CS122A. If you\nare currently enrolled in CS122B and have not completed a prerequisite course, contact\nthe instructor right away and be prepared to demonstrate that you have gained\nthe prerequisite knowledge through some other means. If you have not, you will\nnot be allowed to remain enrolled in the course. </p>\n\n<p>Though not formal prerequisites, you should be a proficient Java programmer, have some familiarity with HTML and C/C++, and work well with others; in previous quarters, students who have lacked these skills have tended to do poorly in the course.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<hr>\n<a name=Enrollment></a>\n<h3>Enrolling in CS122B</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Procedures for dropping the class, petitioning to add the class, changing your grade\noption and related matters are discussed in <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/cs122b/EnrollmentInformation.html\">Enrollment Information</a>.

Under <font class = \"codefacesmall\">UCInetID Activation</font>, click on <font class=\"codeFaceSmall\">Faculty, Staff And Students</font> and follow the instructions. Be sure to have your student ID and social security number handy; you&#146;ll need them to complete the activation process.</p>\n\n<p>You will also need an ICS computer account to use ICS computers. If you are already enrolled in the course, or a major in the Bren School of ICS,\nyour account has already been created. If you are petitioning to add the\nclass (and are not a Bren School major), your account will be created a day or two\nafter you enroll. \n\n<p>You need to activate your ICS account to use it: Bring  your UCI student ID card (and yourself!) to the lab attendant in ICS 364. Your ID will be verified; you then take an on-the-computer quiz about the rules regarding use of ICS computer resources and provide a password. Your account is now ready for use. For details on activating ICS accounts, see the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab/students/acct_activate.php\">Account Activation</a> Web page..</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name=Announcements></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Keeping up with course announcements</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>Throughout the quarter, we post messages of general interest to the \n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/cs122b/Announcements.html\">\nAnnouncements</a> Web page.  Be sure to read it regularly.</p>\n\n<p>We send urgent or particularly important announcements\nby email to your UCInetID account. So, we <i>require</i> that you check\nyour UCInetID email regularly, once daily during the week at least (and recommend checking daily on weekends and holidays as well). If you prefer to read these messages from another\naccount, you need to set your UCI account to forward your email to your\npreferred account; see the <a href=\"http://www.nacs.uci.edu/help/handouts/forward.html\">\nForwarding UCI E-mail </a>Web page for details.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name =\"Texts\"></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Texts</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>None!

Do keep postings limited to CS122B topics; off-topic messages are subject to deletion. Only answer a question if indeed you know the answer to it&#151;lots of\nconfusion can result if wrong information gets spread around!

Work is done by teams of two (except in  special circumstances; see the introductory material in the FabFlixs Project for details). We expect team members to take on a substantially equal part of the learning and work needed to complete the project.</p>\n\n<p>The project is broken into six phases. Phase 0 is where the team sets up the environment\nneeded to develop FabFlixs; it is not graded. Phases 1 through 5 are where the\nteam adds functionality to the FabFlixs system. The work done in these phases\nis graded; the team can earn from 0 to 4 points for each phase's work,\ndepending upon its completeness, correctness, performance and\n&quot;stylishness.&quot; Each member of the team will receive the same score.</p>\n\n<p>Shortly after each of Phases 1 to 5 are turned in, your team will demonstrate to course\nstaff the functionality and performance of the features implemented\nin that phase; each team member should participate\nequally in the demonstration. If the demonstration is done well, and each\nmember participates equally, each team member will earn 1 point. If one member\ndoes well and the other does not appreciably participate, the participating\nmember will get 1 point, but the other member will get 0 points. A member can also\nearn a half of a point if s/he does participate, but not up to the level of the\nother team member, or the presentation as a whole is lacking. This 0, .5, or 1\npoint is added to the individual's score for the phase. So there are a possible\nof 5 points total for each phase.</p>\n\n<p>Each graded phase is worth 20% of your course grade, so a student's score for the course is the sum of the points earned on each of the five graded\nstages. We will assign final grades on <i>at least</i> the following scale; the cutoffs may be lower: Grades in the A range (A-, A, and in exceptional cases, A+), 90% and above; grades in the B range, 80%-89.99%; grades in the C range, 70%-79.99%; grades in the D range, 60%-69.99%; and F grades below that. Using an established point scale means that you are\nnot graded in direct competition with your classmates. Any student who makes a concerted effort to complete course work and gets at least some of the FabFlixs project working will not receive an F.</p>\n\n<p>Contact the TA or me if you have questions about your score. We will\nbe happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we must ask that you bring us\nyour grading questions <i>within one week after a phase's score is posted</i>.</p>\n\n<p>Your assignments will be graded as quickly as feasible; grades will be posted on the eee GradeBook for this class.</p>\n\n<p>More details about team formation (and dissolution), the FabFlixs project's requirements,\nthe project's phases, phase demonstrations, grading, and related matters, are in <a href=\"//www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/cs122b/Project/00-Project.html\">The FabFlixs Project</a> document.</p>\n\n<p>Final course grades, the scores used to compute them, a number of statistics about the class and an end-of-quarter note explaining grade computation will be available on\nthe course Web page soon after the course is over. Follow the links to <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/cs122b/CourseGrades.html\">Course Grades</a> and <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/cs122b/NoteOnGrades.html\">A Note on Course Grades</a> to access that information.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name=Computer></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Team computer</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>To develop the project, you team will need access to a PC onto which you can install the\nenvironment needed for FabFlixs development (and, of course, to develop\nFabFlixs itself). We recommend that the computer be a PC-compatible or Mac running\nWindows.  We know this environment will properly run the tools we require and recommend for this course, and it is the environment we support; in particular, that implies we can help you when you have questions or problems. Though we have not tested whether the course tools work in a Linux or Macintosh O/S environment, students in the past have used these or similar tools in such environments with great success&#151;provided they were reasonably expert in these tools and environments before coming to this course. Course staff will help as best as we can with unsupported environments, but we cannot spend significant time helping you resolve issues with these non-course-standard environments.</p>\n\n<p>The computer can be a laptop or desktop, though a laptop will be easier for\nyou, as you can do your demonstrations directly from that computer by bringing it\nto your team's demonstration meetings.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you that do not have access to a development or demonstration computer, we have provided access to three machines in the main computer room, ICS 364, that you can use for either (or both) purposes. They are located along the windows between air conditionoing units 11 and 13, and are called <font class = \"codefacesmall\">beautifulshiner</font>, <font class = \"codefacesmall\">blue-shiner</font> and <font class = \"codefacesmall\">delta-smelt</font>. If you want to use these computers, email me your name, your team name, and your ICS account name; I will pass that information on to ICS Support, who will add your accounts to those that can log in to these machines. These machines are not pre-configured for this course and so you may have to set them up as you would for a personal machine; see <a\nhref=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/cs122b/Project/03-Phase0.html\">Phase 0 of the FabFlixs project</a> for details.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name=Cooperation></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>About cooperation</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p>You are expected to know and follow UCI and Bren School academic honesty\npolicies; do read them.

The team may not have another person write part of its assignment or let someone\nplan the detailed strategy it will use to attack the problems the assignment\nposes. The team may ask other students for help on technical matters, such as\nwhich of several tools or <i>general</i> approaches might be useful in tackling a particular problem, how to use a particular tool, the appropriate syntax of language or tool statements or commands, what a particular SQL command does or how to interpret an error message. You\nmay, of course, get help from the TA and me: we know what sort of help is allowable, so feel free to ask us any question you have (but we may decline to answer it if it means we would be doing your work for you). </p>\n\n<p>When you use information given in\ntexts or other sources, you must credit the source of that information, be it a book, program code, article, web site, radio or TV broadcast, person or some other source; not doing so is <i>plagiarism</i>, and is considered academically dishonest.</p>\n\n<p>Violations of academic honesty will be dealt with in accordance with Bren School and UCI policies.</p>\n\n<p>Best advice: If you are unsure whether certain behavior is acceptable, ask before you engage in it!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name=GettingStarted></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>What to do to get started in CS122B</h3>\n</div>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Read the course Web pages and the Web documents they reference. \n\t<li>If you need to add the course or change your grade option, follow the instructions on the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jacobson/cs122b/EnrollmentInformation.html\">Enrollment Information</a> sheet.\n\t<li>Find a partner. \n\t<li>Arrange for team access to a personal computer. \n\t<li>Activate your UCInetID and ICS accounts, if they are not yet active. \n\t<li>Begin working on Phase 0. \n</ul>\n\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<a name=Advice></a>\n<hr>\n<h3>Good advice and helpful hints</h3>\n</div>\n\n<p><i>Attend the lectures;</i> Lectures are a required part of the course, so I will not repeat a lecture you chose to skip, though of course I will answer questions about it.
