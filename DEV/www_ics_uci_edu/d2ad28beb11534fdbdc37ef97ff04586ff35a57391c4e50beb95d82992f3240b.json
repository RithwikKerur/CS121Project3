We integrate the middleware abstraction\r\nlayer with the hardware/OS abstraction layer and study mechanisms for capturing resources/architectures at these two levels and allowing interactions between the levels.\r\n\r\n    </td>\r\n    <td>\r\n      <img align=right src=\"heter.gif\">\r\n    </td>\r\n  </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<!--#include file=\"0t.html\" -->\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
