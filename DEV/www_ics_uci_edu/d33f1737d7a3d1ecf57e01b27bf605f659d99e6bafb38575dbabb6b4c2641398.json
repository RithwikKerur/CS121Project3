As long as man and creatures have roamed the \nearth, comets could be seen in the sky.  The Chinese have been \nobserving <a \nhref=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/halley.html\"> \nHalley's Comet</a> since 240 B.C. and was viewed as <a href=\"\nhttp://eyes.gsfc.nasa.gov/\">phenomena</a> that occured only in the \natmosphere until \n1577.  Then a man named Tycho Brahe proved that they were not atmospheric \nelements, but rather celestial bodies.  Since then, obviously astronomy has \nlearned much more information about comets.  But even in today's highly \nscientific era, much of the information we now have on comets is \nbased on theory from gathered data.    <p>\n\n\n<h2>What Is A Comet?</h2>\n<img src=\"comet.gif\"><p>\nComets are commonly known as \"dirty snowballs\" or large balls of cosmic \ndust and ice.  They are left over pieces of astral matter that for one \nreason or another was not involved in the formation of <a \nhref=<http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/nineplanets.html\">planets</a> or moons when the universe was first born.  A comet is formed around a centrally located disk called a coma. Surrounding the coma are many fragments of elments that are commonly\n found in space.  The \"tail\" of the comet is consistes of hydrogen, \ncarbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.  All of these radicals can be broken away \nfrom methane, ammonia, and water which all can exist as ices.  What is \nalso intetresting to note is that comets do not follow Newtonian \ngravitational laws which suggests the theory that the escaping gases \nproduce  a force which hurls the comet through space.  Short lived comets \nalso lose force with time, which suggests that they are similar to \nburning torches, running on only a given amount of fuel.\nThe head of a comet, including the hazy coma, can exceed the size of <a \nhref=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/earth.html\">earth</a>.  That is a scary thought, considering that one day a comet may colliode with our planet.  \n<h2>How The <a \nhref=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/sol.html\">Sun</a> Effects Comets</h2>\n<p>\nA comet is approaching the sun by way ofa great gravitational pull.  As \nthe ball of gases and ice gets nearer to the sun's extreme heat, the \nhigh temperatures cause the comet to become visible.  The molecules of \nthe comet are blown away by the solar wind at a speed of 250 miles per \nsecond.  As a comet's orbit takes it away from the sun, the reduced heat \nand solar wind causes the tail to receed.  So all of the comets that yuou \nand I see pictures of are neer the sun, since the tails are long and \nmagnificent.  The nearer to the \nsun, the more visible the comet.  The sun's gravitational pull causes \ncomets to have an elliptical orbit.  The orbits are so vast that it \ncarries the astral body far out of the solar system. There is also a \ndirect relationship between comets and meteor showers.  When a comet \ncomes relatively close to earth, the debris given off by the tail creates \na meteor shower as it falls into our atmosphere.   \n\n\n<h2>The Importance Of Comets</h2>\n<p>\n\nComets have an effect on our present, past, and future.  Currently they \nare an object of fasciniation and may hold with it the secrets of the \nformation of the universe.  Spawned at the dawn of time, comets may \nhelp to explain how the dinasaurs came to be extinct.  There is a large \ncrater off the eastern coast of Central America that is believed to be an \nimpact crater caused by a comet or <a \nhref=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/asteroids.html\">asteroid</a>. .  \nThis may explain \nthe mysterious dissapearing act put on by our plant's previous tennants.  \nAs we look to the future, the question of whether or not a catastrophic \nevent like this could happen again.  The chances of a the elliptical \norbit of a comit crossing the path of the earth is very small.  However, \nif the head of the comet were to hit a populated area, there would be \nmuch death and destruction.  Our fate would be in the hands of <a \nhref=\"ttp://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/NASA_homepage.html\">NASA</a> to stop the \ncollision.  As of this year(1995), 878 comets have been recognized by \nscience.  They are a relevant part of our <a \nhref=\"http://seds.lpl.arizona.edu/nineplanets/nineplanets/overview.html\"> \nsolar system</a> \n\n<hr>\nSubmitted March 16, 1995 for \nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
