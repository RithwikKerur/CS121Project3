We\nconstruct the straight skeleton of an $n$-gon with $r$ reflex vertices\nin time $O(n^{1+\\e} + n^{8/11+\\e}r^{9/11+\\e})$, for any fixed $\\e&gt;0$,\nimproving the previous best upper bound of $O(nr\\log n)$.  Practical\nvariants of our algorithm run in time $O(n\\log n + nr)$ using space\n$O(n + r^2)$ and in time $O(n\\log n + nr + r^2\\log n)$ using only\nlinear space.\n \nOur algorithm simulates the sequence of interactions between edges and\nvertices during the shrinking process, using a technique of Eppstein\nfor maintaining extrema of binary functions to reduce the problem of\nfinding successive interactions to two dynamic range query problems:\n(1) maintain a changing set of triangles in $\\Real^3$ and answer\nqueries asking which triangle would be first hit by a query ray, and\n(2) maintain a changing set of rays in $\\Real^3$ and answer queries\nasking for the lowest intersection of any ray with a query triangle.\nWe also exploit a novel characterization of the straight skeleton as a\nlower envelope of triangles in $\\Real^3$.\n \nThe same time bounds apply to constructing non-self-intersecting\noffset curves with mitered or beveled corners, and similar methods\nextend to other problems of simulating pairwise interactions among\nsets of moving objects.\n \nThis is joint work with David Eppstein.

However only in  1961 did Wolfgang Haken give an explicit\ndecision procedure to recognize unknottedness, based\non normal surface theory. This talk reviews the history of\nproblems in computational topology and knot theory. It\nthen describes  explicit complexity bounds for the unknotting\nproblem. Recognizing if a knot diagram with $n$ crossings is\nunknotted is in the  complexity class NP. If a knot diagram is\nunknotted, then there  is an explicit unknotting that takes\nat most $O(2^cn)$ Reidemeister moves, with $c=10^12.$\n(These results are joint work with Joel Hass(U.  Calif.-Davis)\nand Nick Pippenger(U. British Columbia)).\n\n\t\t\tAlgorithms for Variants of the TSP\n\t\t\t\tEstie Arkin\n\t\t\t      SUNY Stony Brook\n\nWe discuss some variants of TSP tour and path optimization problems:\n \nThe Scatter Traveling Salesman Problem\nWe study the problem of computing a Hamilton tour or path on a set of\npoints in order to maximize the minimum edge length. We give\ncomplexity results, approximation algorithms and exact algorithms for\nsome special cases. We also consider a generalization in which the\npoints on the tour should be far not only from their immediate\npredecessor and successor, but also from other neighbours on the tour.\nThe motivating applications are in manufacturing (sequencing of rivet\noperations) and medical imaging.\n \nThe Rooted Orienteering Problem\nWe study the problem of computing a circuit visiting as many points as\npossible from a given a set of points, including a designated root,\nsuch that the total (Euclidean) distance traveled is bounded by a given\nnumber $B$. We give the first constant factor approximation for this problem.\n \nWork on some of these problems is joint with Yi-Jen Chiang,\nJoe Mitchell, Giri Narasimhan, Steve Skiena and Tae-Cheon Yang.\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
