And the isosceles triangle\ncan be subdivided into two similar isosceles triangles and an\nequilateral triangle, all three having the same area, by trisecting its\nhypotenuse and connecting the resulting points to the opposite vertex.\nThe following image shows several levels of this subdivision process,\nwith the triangles at each level scaled to have the same area.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"levels.gif\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nRepeating this subdivision and scaling process produces an infinite\ntiling of the plane (or actually a family of different tilings) which\nI call the \"labyrinth tilings\" for reasons to\nbe made clear below.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"tiling.gif\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nAt first glance, this tiling looks quite uniform: it is formed by a\nregular pattern of 60-120 rhombuses, each subdivided by a diagonal into\ntwo triangles.  The only variation occurs in the choice of which diagonal to use.\nNevertheless we will see that this tiling has quite an interesting\naperiodic structure.\n\n<H2>Position Coding</H2>\n\nFor many aperiodic tilings, one can prove aperiodicity by considering\nthe ratios in which the different kinds of tiles are used.  If these\nratios are irrational, the tiling is aperiodic.  For instance\nthe occurrence in the Penrose tiling of the golden ratio shows that it\nis aperiodic.  Unfortunately, this does not work for our labyrinth\ntilings: the isosceles and equilateral triangles occur in the ratio 3:1.\nWe need to prove aperiodicity a different way.  We will do so using a\nmethod for using certain sequences to encode the positions of triangles\nin the tiling.\n<P>\nNote that from any step <I>k</I> in the subdivision process that forms the tiling,\nthere is only one way of reversing the process and recovering the tiling\nat step <I>k</I>-1.  For, any equilateral triangle at step <I>k</I> must\nhave exactly two isosceles neighbors (and one equilateral neighbor);\nthis equilateral triangle and pair of isosceles neighbors forms a larger\nisosceles triangle at step <I>k</I>-1.  The remaining isosceles\ntriangles form triples meeting at their obtuse angles, which form larger\nequilateral triangles at step <I>k</I>-1.  From the triangles at step <I>k</I>-1\nwe can recover those at step <I>k</I>-2, and so on.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"poscode.gif\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nDefine the <I>position code</I> of each triangle in a labyrinth tiling\nto be the infinite sequence of shapes and orientations of these larger and larger\ntriangles at previous levels of the subdivision.\n<P>\nThe position code of a single triangle determines the arrangement of\ntriangles in all neighborhoods of the triangle, and therefore determines\nthe overall labyrinth tiling.\nTwo triangles belong to the same tiling when their position codes\ndiffer in only a finite number of places.\n(There are also some cases when two points separated by an infinite ray\nof a tiling can have position codes differing in infinitely many places.)\n<P>\nThe existence of these position codes shows that any labyrinth tiling is aperiodic.\nFor, any point in the triangle belongs to a unique triangle at any previous level\n<I>j</I>&lt;<I>k</I> of the subdivision process.  In particular we can choose\n<I>j</I> so that the triangle is larger than any given period of\ntranslational symmetry.  No point within this large triangle can be\ntaken to any other point in the triangle by a translational symmetry.\nSo no such symmetry can exist, and the tiling is aperiodic.  (Note that,\njust as in the case of the Penrose tilings, a finite number of\nrotational symmetries may still exist).\n\n<H2>Labyrinths</H2>\n\nThe edges in the labyrinth tilings lie at six different slopes,\nat 30 degree angles to each other.  If we look at only those edges which\nare horizontal or vertical, an interesting pattern emerges.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"labyrinth.gif\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nThese edges seem to mark out the boundaries of a\nspace-filling labyrinth that covers the entire plane.\n(The labyrinths of the ancients, unlike modern mazes, were typically\n<I>unicursal</I>, having\nneither branches nor dead ends [<A HREF=\"phillips.html\">Phillips</A>].)\nBecause of the tiling's six-fold symmetry, this labyrinth is overlaid\nwith two others, at 30 and 60 degree angles to it.\n<P>\nThese patterns can be explained using position codes.\nIt turns out that,\ngiven any two points in the tiling, either\nan infinite horizontal or vertical ray in the tiling crosses the line\nsegment between them, or there is a unique sequence of triangles that forms a path\nconnecting them and is not crossed by any horizontal or vertical edges.\n<P>\nTo prove this, look at the position codes of the two points.\nEventually the large triangles in the codes get so large that there is\nonly room for two possible configurations: either the two points are in\na single large triangle, or they are in two adjacent triangles.\n<P>\nIf the two points are in adjacent triangles at all the infinitely many levels\nof the position codes, and if those triangles are always separated by a\nhorizontal or vertical segment, then these segments combine to form an\ninfinite horizontal or vertical ray or line.  In this case, this line\nmay separate the points from each other.\n<P>\nOtherwise, at some level <I>j</I>\nof the subdivision process, the path we are looking for connecting the two points\nconsists simply of these one or two triangles from the position codes of\nthe two points.\nWe now show that each level of the subdivision process preserves the\nexistence of these paths.  To do this, we use a slightly modified version of the\nsubdivision process that ends up tiling a larger area than the original triangles.\nAt each step, we follow the usual subdivisions described above, except that\nif the resulting area has an isosceles triangle hypotenuse on its boundary that\nis neither vertical nor horizontal, we add the matching triangle on the\nother side of that edge.  Because of this addition, all isosceles\ntriangles with slanted hypotenuses can be assumed to form matched pairs.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"hvsubdiv.gif\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nAs can be seen above, if before the subdivision a set of triangles is\ncrossed by a path of triangles (connected to each other by slanted edges),\na modified version of the same path will wind through the same region\nafter the subdivision.  Therefore there is a single\npath covering a region surrounding the two given points, which produces the unique path connecting the points that I claimed existed.\n\n<P>\n<HR><P>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"index.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
