The results aren't real deep, nor are they\nalways satisfying from the standpoint of the goal of describing\na metric that is efficiently computable and in which closeness\nwould imply \"similar geometry\" -- but the paper is a start\nin the direction of developing efficiently-computable metrics\nthat are stronger than the Hausdorff metric with respect to\nmeasuring how well one figure approximates another geometrically,\nas well as positionally.  The paper of Stern, cited below, is\nanother such attempt.\n\nBelow are some references on metrics (Hausdorff and beyond).\nSome are topology references that may be useful to computational\ngeometers only from the standpoint of originating the suggestion\nof adding another comparison of two figures to their Hausdorff\ndistance in order to obtain a stronger metric.  Others are\ncomputational geometry references.\n\nAtallah, M.J.

The\n&gt;question\n&gt;|&gt; is : How can I characterize that two compact sets are shape close.\n&gt;\n&gt;Looks like you could use a dilatation operator on your set, and then use\n&gt;Haussdorff.\n&gt;\n&gt;By the way, how do you define shape? If it has some relationship with measure,\n&gt;then if your sets are given by union of some sets, get first rid of the\n&gt;null-measure\n&gt;sets.\n&gt;\n&gt;I would use the first method. There is a metric used in image processing which \n&gt;does about what you want, but I do not remember the name (sorry!, it is\n&gt;not my field,\n&gt;I just used to do maths with some of these guys). It definitely had\n&gt;something to do with\n&gt;dilatation.\n\nYou're thinking of \"mathematical morphology,\" the image processing\narea that uses dilation.  The Hausdorff metric has been called the\nbasis of mathematical morphology, for whatever that's worth.\n\nAs the original post hinted, the Hausdorff metric is sensitive to\noutlying points in a shape.  The so-called template metric, the other\none mentioned in the original post ( d(x,y) = area(x-y) + area(y-x),\nwhere x and y are shapes ), ignores outliers, and the construction\nof the Minkowski sum of a shape and a small ball (i.e. dilation) \nis not continuous in this metric.\n\nThe issue of what is a \"shape\" is, of course, important, but we in the\nimage processing world try to ignore such details when possible.  I\nrealize that's not appropriate here.  In general, the natural domain\nof the Hausdorff metric is the set of compact shapes, and the natural\ndomain of the template metric is the space of measurable subsets.  As\nnoted, we can ignore sets of measure zero for the template metric, but\nnot for the Hausdorff metric.\n\nBut there are many other ways to define metrics between shapes. One I\nuse in my work is the transport, or Monge-Kantorovich metric:\n\nFor S_1,S_2 subsets of the real plane, d(S_1,S_2) = \n    inf { int_{S_1} int_{S_2}  abs(x_1 - x_2)  dp(x_1,x_2) },\nwhere the inf is taken over all probability measures p on S_1 x S_2\nwith fixed marginals:\n    int_{S_1} int_{U_2} dp(x_1,x_2) = area(U_2)/area(S_2),\n    int_{U_1} int_{S_2} dp(x_1,x_2) = area(U_1)/area(S_1).\nThink of this as the amount of work required to rearrange the pieces\nof shape S_1 into the shape of S_2.  The transport metric is a good\ncombination of the template and Hausdorff metrics in practice, since\nit gives equal weight to all points of a shape.  Its natural domain is\nthe space of probability measures, if we assign a measure\n\tp_S (U) = area(S \\cap U) / area(S)\nto each shape S.  In this way we can also discuss \"fuzzy shapes,\"\nwhere membership in a shape near a boundary is not a binary\ndecision.\n\tThe transport metric can be quickly calculated with linear\nprogramming.\n\nAnother popular metric in image processing now has been studied at\nBrown: the optimal diffeomorphism metric d(S_1,S_2) = \n\tinf { int_{S_1} |Jp|^2 + int_{S_2} |J(p^{-1})|^2 },\nwhere the inf is taken over all one-to-one, onto differentiable\nmaps p:S_1 -&gt; S_2 with inverse p^{-1}, and J is its Jacobian.\nThe main problem with this metric is that two shapes identical except\nfor an infinitesimal tear will be infinitely far apart because they\nare not topologically equivalent and admit no diffeomorphisms.\nThere have been extensions and changes to this metric to deal with \nthese situations.\n\nNote that the question of \"what metric to use to find a distance\nbetween shapes\" is very dependent on what you're trying to do.  I\nthink the transport metric gives answers that are fairly close to what\nhumans would give, but if you're trying to find a hairline crack\ndefect in a machine tool, that's not a very good solution.  So\nconsider your needs while you're considering your metrics.\n\nSuggested references:\n\nDavid Mumford, \"Mathematical theories of shape: do they model\nperception?\", _SPIE Proceedings Volume 1570_, San Diego, 1991.\n\nDavid Mumford, \"The problem of robust shape descriptors,\"\n_Proceedings of the IEEE First International Conference on Computer\nVision_, London, 1987, 602-606.\n\nS.
