There were 55 people in attendace.  The\nmeeting was chaired by Jim Whitehead, and minutes were taken by Stephen\nMartin, and John Stracke.  Jim Davis began the meeting by leading discussion\non Advanced Collections capability.  This discussion ran through the\nAdvanced Collections Requirements, followed by the Advanced Collections\nProtocol.  The most significant comment concerned the need to clarify the\ntext to distinguish between a URL, a resource, and a reference.  Jim Davis\nrecorded several discussion points, which he will take to the discussion\nlist.\n\n<P>Lisa Lippert next led discussion on the Access Control requirements\ndocument. Participants commented that the document needs to be clear on\nwhether the goal is to make an access control protocol which exactly maps to\nthe access control mechanisms of underlying repositories, or whether the\ngoal is to have an access control protocol which is WebDAV-specific, and\nwhich will likely not map exactly to the access control mechanisms of many\nrepositories.  The sentiment in the room was to support the latter.\n\n<P>At this point, there was brief discussion of the mailing list\nthread on &quot;Hierarchical URLs and collections&quot; which was\nperceived to be the issue of whether the same chunk of persistent\nstate can be accessed via multiple URLs, and if so, whether the WebDAV\nDistributed Authoring Protocol specification needs to set policy for\nhow to handle operations on these multi-URL chunks of state.\nDiscussion of this issue will continue on the list.\n\n<P>Chris Kaler finished the meeting by presenting a summary of the recent\nVersioning and Variant Authoring Design Team meeting.  There was brief\ndiscussion of whether it was OK for the Design Team to address automatic\nversioning (versioning for downlevel clients), and simple configuration\nmanagement support (similar to CVS).  No dissent was raised for addressing\nautomatic versioning.  Some participants noted that the versioning protocol\nmight be useful even if it didn't address configuration management, but\ndidn't object to development along this path.\n\n</body>\n</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
