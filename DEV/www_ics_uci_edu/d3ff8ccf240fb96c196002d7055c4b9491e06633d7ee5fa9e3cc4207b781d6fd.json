Rosenblum, Information & Computer Science, University of\nCalifornia, Irvine\n</h3>\n<p>\nThe organization of WISEN attests to the growing interest among many\ndifferent communities in the problem of how to provide efficient delivery of\nevent notifications on an Internet scale.  But what exactly is \"event\nnotification\", and what exactly does \"Internet scale\" mean?  Each community\nhas its own interpretation of these terms, and the interpretations typically\nreflect the specific needs of the community.  In this talk I will offer a\ncharacterization of Internet scale event notification that is intended to be\nacceptable to the broad range of communities represented at WISEN.\n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
