I'll be more then glad to \r\nshare his history with you, and i would be very appreciative if you could halp \r\nme with some information in return.\r\n\r\nELYUKIM URI was born between the years of 1835-1845, to his father ? (whose \r\ninformation i'm missing), in the galicia part of poland, there he grew up, \r\nmarried his first wife with whom he raised a family, unfortunately, his wife \r\npassed away at early stage, and he remarried HINDA the daughter of r' ISSAC \r\nPREISS from \"KOSICE\" .{i don't remember if she was a widow or still a girl} \r\nwhen r' ELYUKIM remarried he moved to KOSICE, which was near or a part of \r\nHUNGARY and because of that he changed his surename from \"URI\" to \"UHR\", \r\nwhich means an emperor in hungarian language, he had three children with his \r\nwife HINDA {one of them was my g.g.mother named RACHEL who married my \r\ng.g.father r' PINCHAS TZVI RUBIN, they had about 9-10 children & they both \r\nwhere killed in the gas chambers in auchswitz by nazi germeny}, reb ELYUKIM \r\npassed away at the age of about \"80\" between the years of 1915-1925 and was \r\nburied in kosice. His wife passed away on DEC.10 1937 and she to was buried \r\nin kosice. In fact I even have a photograph of her tomestone where she is \r\nmentioed as\" wife of famous rabbi elyukim uhr\".\r\n\r\nAlso, while doing research, I once came across of the jewish cemetery listing \r\nin KOSICE, among the many people buried there,was:UHR ILIAS, AUGUST 3 1919, \r\nAGE 80, It was my assumption that it may have been ELYUKIM UHR.{here is the \r\naddress take a look at it:}\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kosice.sk/history/zidovsky/jew_ux.htm \r\n\r\nHastly, I would like to know how you obtained the information that ELYUKIM was \r\na son of r' YAAKOV, and if you would think it is the same ELYUKIM I'm talking \r\nabout\r\n\r\n                                                            GOOD LUCK!\r\n\r\n                                                            sincerely yours\r\n\r\n                                                            JOEL RUBIN\r\n_____________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Mon, 20 Aug 2001 21:52:39 -0400\r\nTo: joel rubin &lt;sighet2000@yahoo.com>\r\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" &lt;moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: uri {uhr} family tree\r\nBcc: moishe@langsam.com\r\n\r\nHi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your inquiry.
