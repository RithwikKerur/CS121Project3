However, the scaling requirements of large distributed systems (like\nthe internet) also require interfaces for event notification that are as\nsimple as possible.\n \nI will describe a simple distributed event notification system developed as\npart of the work done by the Java(tm) distributed computing group. Some of the\nmore interesting features, such as transparent interposition of third-party\nentities in the delivery chain and the use of portable object code, will be\ndiscussed. Finally, wild speculation will take place as to the relevance of\nthis work to internet-scale applications.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/IRUS/\">\nIrvine Research Unit in Software</a><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">\nInformation and Computer Science</A><BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">\nUniversity of California, Irvine</A><BR>\nIrvine, CA 92697-3425\n</ADDRESS>\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
