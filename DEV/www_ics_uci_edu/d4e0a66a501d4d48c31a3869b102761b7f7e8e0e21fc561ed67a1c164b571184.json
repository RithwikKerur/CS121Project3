They believe in inspiring women to pursue careers\r\n      in the field as diversity in the field will help cater to the broad and creative audience.<br><br>\r\n      Their many goals include discovering the reason for the lack of women in the fields on computer \r\n      technology, and trying to solve this problem by identifying what captures female interest in\r\n      terms of research, and inventions to build a better united national platform for progress. This year,\r\n      they've joined forces with ReturnPath to help the female community in technology grow. <br><br>\r\n      UC Irvine's Women in Information and Computer Science (WICS) would like to thank <b>NCWIT and ReturnPath</b> for\r\n      entrusting us with the $500 Seed Fund to aid our efforts to introduce more girls and women\r\n      to computer science. Using the Seed Grant, WICS plans to host a \"Conference\" to showcase\r\n      the brilliant past and present work of faculty and graduate students in an effort to highlight\r\n      the female members of our technical community.  Visitors would be able to talk to the creators\r\n      of the projects and get to know the field in a more intimate manner as well as develop an interest in computers.\r\n      WICS hopes to demonstrate that Computer Technology is more than what most people know.<br><br>\r\n      The event targets those who are undecided/undeclared major students in our university as well\r\n      as the juniors and seniors enrolled in the local high school. Other departments at UCI are\r\n      also invited, attracting them with how combining their given fields with technology can have \r\n      a huge impact in their careers. This will not only raise awareness about technology and computing,\r\n      but also encourage them to pursue a major or even a minor in the field of computer science.\r\n</p>\r\n      <p class=\"style55\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div id= \"header\">\r\n  <img src=\"NewHeader4.png\" width=\"767\" height=\"198\" /> </div>\r\n\r\n  <!--\r\n  <div id=\"container-footer\">\r\n  <div id=\"content-footer\">\r\n    <div class=\"style26\">\r\n      <div id=\"textpadding\">\r\n        <div align=\"right\" class=\"style123\"><strong><span class=\"style68\"> <br />\r\n        </span></strong><span class=\"style68\"> Copyright &copy; UC Irvine, 2006 - 2009.
