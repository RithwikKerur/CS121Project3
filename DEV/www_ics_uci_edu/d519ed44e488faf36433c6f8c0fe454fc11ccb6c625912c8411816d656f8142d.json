A move consists of\nsubtracting a nonzero square from the current value, producing\na new current value for the other player. You may not subtract\nmore than the current value. The player who reaches 0 wins.\nFor example, 1 is a winning value because having this value on\nyour move means you can win the game. In fact, from 1 you can\nwin in 1 move by subtracting 1. 2, on the other hand, is a\n\"zugzwang value,\" or z-value, because no matter what move you\nmake, your opponent will be left with a winning value. In fact\nthe only legal move from 2 is to subtract 1 leaving 1 for the \nother player. Every natural number is either a winning value\nor a z-value, but never both. Zugzwang is a chess term\nindicating a position wherein the obligation to move is a\ndisadvantage. The z-list, or the set of all z-values, can be\ngenerated by these production rules:\n\n  1. 0 is the first z-value. (This simplifies matters.)\n  2. Given that you have a list of all z-values less than n,\n     n is a winning\n     value IF AND ONLY IF it is greater than some z-value on\n                          the list by a nonzero square.\n           OTHERWISE, n must be a z-value.\n\n    Out of all the over 180,000 z-values less than 40 million,\nONLY ONE z-value ends in a 6: 11,356. Z-values that end in 1,\n3, or 8 are also few and far between. I suspect the set of\nall z-values that = 1(mod 5) or 3(mod 5) is finite. Perhaps\nthis has something to do with the fact that both 5 and 10 can\nbe expressed as the sum of 2 different squares. A cursory\nstatistical analysis of the distribution of z-values with\nrespect to other modulus bases seems to corroborate this.\nModulus bases 13 and 17, which can also be expressed as the\nsum of 2 different squares, show some uneven distribution, but\nnothing as severe as bases that are multiples of 5. Other\nbases, which are neither the sum of 2 different squares nor\nmultiples of such a base, show remarkably even distribution.\n   The set of z-pairs, or z-values that differ by 2, appears\nto be infinite. The largest such pair found so far is\n39,955,435 and 39,955,437. The z-list itself must be infinite,\nsince assuming there exists some greatest z-value G leads to\na contradiction when you consider that G^2 + G + 1 must be a\nz-value.\n   There are plenty of directions to go from here; for example\nthere are related games \"subtract-a-cube,\" \"subtract-a-power\"\netc. One could abandon the restriction that the generation\nrules be based on any game at all. Regrettably, my only access\nto the net is through a monitor, so I cannot send my software\nor data.

One can make a hand\nwaving argument that they ought to disappear eventually, which goes like this.\n\nConsider the distribution of z-values mod N. Numbers are prevented from being\nz-values by being a smaller z-value plus a square. Thus an excess of values in\none residue class will tend to suppress subsequent z-values in classes differing\nfrom the first by a quadratic residue mod N, and a deficit to enhance them. If\n-1 is a quadratic residue mod N this leads to positive feedback between the two\nresidue classes, and (especially dramatic hand wave here) one will eventually\nkill off the other completely. The non-zero quadratic residues mod 5 being +1\nand -1, we see the enhancement of 0 and 2 practically preventing 1 ever appearing\nat all, while 3 gets more of a chance with less suppression from 4 than from 2.\n0 and 4 are fighting each other and 0 must eventually suppress 4 entirely.\n\nThe same sort of effect ought to happen mod 13, 17, 29, ... and it would also\nbe interesting to have statistics for these also. The argument above would \nsuggest that the only surviving residue classes should form a set such that\nno pair differ by a quadratic residue.\n\n|&gt; \n|&gt; &gt;   The set of z-pairs, or z-values that differ by 2, appears\n|&gt; &gt;to be infinite. The largest such pair found so far is\n|&gt; &gt;39,955,435 and 39,955,437.\n|&gt; \n|&gt; There are 2816 pairs less than 2^28, with the largest being 268,063,140 and\n|&gt; 268,063,150.\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^ (Arthur Rubin has sent me e-mail correcting this to 268,063,142)\n\nIf the above argument is correct, they ought eventually to disappear, as 2 is\na quadratic residue mod 17 (for example). In fact, the gaps between z-values\nshould tend to infinity, though no doubt terribly slowly.\n\nAnother question concerns the computational cost of determining the z-values\nup to N. To compute the Nim values of all positions up to N would cost N^{3/2}\nusing the obvious methods, but one can do better than this if one only wants \nthe z-values as one can use early abort strategies (you know a value is not a\nz-value as soon as you have found *one* z-value and *one* square that sum to \nit). How much does/could this save?\n\nChris Thompson\nJANET:    <a href=\n\"mailto:cet1@uk.ac.cam.phx\">cet1@uk.ac.cam.phx</a>\nInternet: <a href=\n\"mailto:cet1@phx.cam.ac.uk\">cet1@phx.cam.ac.uk</a>\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
