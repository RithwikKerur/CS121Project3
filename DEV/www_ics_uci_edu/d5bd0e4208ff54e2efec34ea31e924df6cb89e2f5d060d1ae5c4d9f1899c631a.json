OpenCV.js extends the OpenCV language binding by\nproviding a JavaScript interface. It allows emerging web applications with multimedia processing\nto benefit from the wide variey of vision functions available in OpenCV.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe goal of this project is to extend and improve performance of OpenCV.js.  It has several thrusts:\n<LI>\tHigh performance: allow OpenCV.js to be used in demanding applications, e.g. video processing.  The\nOpenCV.js is based on ASM.js specification and near native performance is obtained on most modern browsers.\nWe also added support for SIMD.js to take advatage of processor's vector (SIMD) processing capabilities. \n</LI>\n<LI>\tCover a large subset of OpenCV. Currently, more than 50 classes and 800 functions from libraries including core, image processing, vidoe processing, image codecs, machine learning are already supported in our version of OpenCV.js. \n</LI>\n<LI>\tAPI Correspondence: We aimed to provide an API close to originial OpenCV API to make\nit easier to write/port applications.\nCompare the two code <A HREF=\"./snippets.html\">snippets</A> of the <I> erode </I> function in C++ and the equivalent OpenCV.js implementation. \n</LI>\n<br>\nOpenCV.js is publicly available at our github repository  \n<A HREF=\"https://github.com/ucisysarch/opencvjs\">here</A>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b> OpenCV.js has been released as part of the OpenCV library!!! See documentation and tutorials at https://docs.opencv.org/master</b>  Also available on NPM: # npm -i opencv.js\n<br> <br>\n<br>\nThis project is supported by Intel Corp.\n</dir>\n\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
