However, with the rise of\nhigh-tech computers in the 80's and 90's, a new kind of crime\nemerged along with it.  The act of stealing computer\nsoftware, known as piracy, has been growing out of proportion\nin the past few years.  As a result of this, software\ncompanies are losing billions of dollars in lost revenue\nevery year for which the legitimate consumer ultimately\nsuffers with higher prices.  Many attempts were made by both\nthe government and software companies to counter this trend,\nbut to no avail.  Time is running out and as our world\neconomy becomes increasingly dependent on information and\ntechnology, protecting intellectual property is essential for\nour future.  In this paper, I will explore the world of\ncomputer piracy along with possible solutions for resolving it.</P>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>Definition</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>Computer piracy, by definition, is the unauthorized\nduplication of computer software.  It can occur when a person\npurchases software and duplicates it in order to give it to\ntheir friends, relatives, or whomever.  That person can then\nmake more copies and give it to their friends which\nperpetuates this ongoing cycle.  Another way in which\nunauthorized distribution takes place is through illegal\ncomputer bulletin board services (BBS) that distribute\nhundreds of copyrighted commercial software as well as\npornography and other censored material.  Computer piracy\ndoes not only occur between private friends and BBS's, but\nalso through corporate sites where an enormous number of\npirated software is distributed.</P>\n<BR>\n<UL>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.digital.com/gnn/bus/hewm/intellectual_property.html\">Software as intellectual property</A>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.portal.com/~cyberlaw/cylw894.html\">Software \nPatents</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://gnv.ifas.ufl.edu/WWW/PIRATE/RESOURCE.HTM#part2\">Software \nCopyright Resources</A>\n</UL> \n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>How has it come this far?</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>The reason that computer piracy has become so big is\nbecause it is so easy to get away with.  First of all, it\nonly takes a computer and an inexpensive blank disk in order\nto duplicate the particular software for distribution.\nSecond, since the information on diskettes are recorded\ndigitally, the precision and integrity of the software's code\nis always perfect.  Digital information can be copied at no\ncost and with practically no detection since the 1000th copy\nmade of a particular software will be indistinguishable from\nthe original.</P>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>Facts and Figures</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>It is estimated that the software industry lost more\nthan $12.8 billion due to piracy with $2.2 billion in the\nU.S.  alone according to the Business Software Alliance.\nThey also estimate that 35% of the total software in the U.S.\nmay be illegal, 80% in Japan, and an incredible 99% in Thailand.\nWith staggering figures like these, the software companies have\nno other choice but to raise the prices on their software in\norder to make up for the lost revenue.</P>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>Legal Issues</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>Stopping computer piracy or even controlling piracy\nalone is a very difficult task as it was evident in the past\nevents.  At first, the government proposed and passed\ndifferent kinds of laws discouraging computer piracy.\nAccording to the U.S. Copyright Law, computer piracy is a\nfederal offense and civil damages can be as much as $50,000\nor more and criminal penalties include fines and\nimprisonment.  This may seem like a pretty tough law, but\nunfortunately people ignore it because computer piracy is\nvery easy to get away with.  Consequently, the government got\nspecific by passing a legislation that made\npossessing ten unauthorized copies of a software program a\nfelony.</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview.html\">Copyright \nAct of 1976</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"gopher://isaac.engr.washington.edu/0R54109-56869-/arch/usenet/comp.os.os2.announce/Comp.os.os2.announce.9411\">Reward for information about piracy</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://gnv.ifas.ufl.edu/WWW/PIRATE/POLICY.HTM#part1\">Software \nCopyright Policies and Guidelines</A></UL> \n\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>Past Failed Attempts</H2>\n<BR>\n<P>With new laws proving to be\nineffective, software developers tried to counter computer\npiracy by developing a technique called 'copy-protection'.\nThey tried to outsmart software thieves by either altering\ntracks on the diskette in order to make it harder to\nduplicate or making the software perform 'document checks' in\nwhich the program requests particular information from the\nowner's manual of the software in order to run the program.\nThis would insure that the person currently running the\nprogram is the legitimate owner.  This also eventually became\na futile attempt by software companies; highly skilled\ncomputer hackers used their knowledge to remove the copy-\nprotection.  After all of this, it is evident that new strict\nlaws by the government nor schemes to outsmart potential\nthieves by the software industry do not intimidate the\nhackers any bit.</P>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>Roots to the problem</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>When trying to resolve computer piracy, you must first\nlook at the roots that contribute to it.  In analyzing the\ncauses of computer piracy that I have already mentioned,\nit can be broken down to two main factors.\nFirst, one source of computer piracy is between private\ncitizens (between friends and BBS's). Second, another main\nsource of computer piracy occurs on corporate sites.  </P>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>Ethics and Moral Issues</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>Computer piracy is very common among private citizens.\npeople can make copies for their friends, family, or just\nabout anyone.  Unfortunately, many people innocently feel\nthat they are doing nothing wrong by making a few copies for\ntheir friends.  They do not realize that they are not only\ndoing a disservice to themselves by breaking the law, but\nalso by causing everyone to suffer from the increase in\nprices on future software.  When\na consumer legally purchases a piece of software from a\nvendor, there is a contract that exists between the software\ncompany and the consumer.  Most people believe that once they\nhave purchased software,\nthey own it.  This is not quite true.  In fact, what has been\npurchased is the license allows the purchaser to use the\nproduct.  The software company still owns the software.  This\nlack of understanding often leads to breaches of contract\nthrough software piracy, and in many cases the pirates are\nnot even aware of the illegalities of their actions.  We must\nalso understand that there is a mutual trust between the\nconsumer and the software developer; \"the consumer trusts that\nthe software developer will develop the best possible\nsoftware along with the fairest prices and the software\ndeveloper trusts that the consumer will use the software only\nin the manner for which they have purchased it\" and will not\nmake any unauthorized copies.(SPA)</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.allencol.edu/ethics.html\">Academic Computing \nCenter <I>Ethical</I> Policies</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"gopher://inform.umd.edu:7070/0gopher://gopher.inform.umd.edu:70/00/Computing_Resources/NetInfo/ReadingRoom/software-piracy\">The Ethics of Software Piracy</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"gopher://gopher.cni.org/0R100557-108080-/cniftp/forums/cni-copyright/93.11\">In the matter of Software Piracy</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"gopher://megasun.bch.umontreal.ca/00/IntRes/Help/internet.spa\">Piracy on the Internet!</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://gnv.ifas.ufl.edu/WWW/PIRATE/TRAINING.HTM#part3\">Software \nCopyright Training Materials</A>\n\n</UL> \n\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>Possible Solutions?</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>We must educate the consumers, here and abroad, on the\nlegal and ethical issues of computer piracy.  Although a lot\nof attention is given to the new computer technology,\ncomputer piracy is rarely addressed in the media or in the\neducational institutions.  Raising the public's awareness\nabout computer piracy is a very realistic proposal\nand can be executed without much hassle.  One prime example\nwho are already executing this plan are the two major anti-\npiracy organizations: Business Software Alliance (BSA) and\nSoftware Publishers Association (SPA).  One objective for\nboth the BSA and the SPA is education; they want the public\nto understand what computer piracy is.  In order to do this,\nthese organizations have printed numerous brochures about\npiracy and also made public messages on television to inform\nthe public about what is going on.  The SPA have also set up\na 1-800# for the public in which they can call with questions\ndealing with piracy and its legalities.  I believe that the\ngovernment can also take part in this by making publicized\nmessages on television/radio and even implement them through\neducation in the schools.  These are both good means of\ngetting the message out to the public.</P>\n     <P>In dealing with big corporations about computer piracy,\nI think that actions and litigation must be put forth against\nthem.  Non-profit organization such as the SPA are the\nleading groups that help litigate and convict corrupt\ncorporations.  These SPA alone filed 245 lawsuits for illegal\nsoftware copying, had 332 cease and desist orders issued, had\n577 organizations targeted for investigation, and fined $3.6\nmillion in total fines to corporate sites in 1993 alone\n(Brandel 12).  With these numbers, we can see that the SPA\nhas done a substantial job into fighting piracy for a single\norganization.</P>\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"gopher://una.hh.lib.umich.edu/00/ebb/soft/soft9309.008\">BSA \n(Business Software Alliance)</A>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.express-systems.com/csminfo.htm\">SPA (Software \nPublishers Association)</A>\n</UL>\n\n <HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>And the Rest of the World?</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>Even if the United States succeeds in the fight against\npiracy, the rest of the world still remains a big problem.\nComputer piracy is even worse in Asia, Europe, and other\nparts of the world.  In some countries, laws do not exist in\nwhich the unauthorized duplication of copyrighted material is\nprohibited.  Even though 80% of all the software in the world\nis from the United States, we cannot simply act as the \"world\npolice\" and enforce its own laws on other countries.  I\nbelieve that the U.S. government should get involved and try\nto communicate with the governments of other countries in\norder to help prevent piracy abroad.  We should encourage\nforeign countries to enforce its copyright laws if they do\nhave one and establish copyright laws if they don't have one.</P>\n\n</B>Other foreign countries and their laws:\n<UL>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"gopher://sunny.stat-usa.gov/00/STAT-USA/NTDB/Market/Imi94/111095754\">Spain</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"gopher://sunny.stat-usa.gov/00/STAT-USA/NTDB/Market/Imi94/111093590\">Guatelmala</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"gopher://sunny.stat-usa.gov/00/STAT-USA/NTDB/Market/Imi94/111092756\">India</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"gopher://sunny.stat-usa.gov/00/STAT-USA/NTDB/Market/Imi94/111092472\">Czech Repub.</A>\n</UL>\n\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2>Conclusion</H2>\n<BR>\n     <P>In conclusion, when we mention the word \"pirate\", two\ndifferent versions of it come to our minds.  The first are\nthe ruthless and violent men on a ship who stole treasures\nfrom other people hundreds of years ago.  The second thing\nthat comes to mind is a person that illegally duplicates\ncomputer software without buying it.  It may be difficult to\ndraw a relationship from these two viewpoints, but the act\nof either piracy is pretty much the same thing.  It is theft.\nBoth were and are illegal and both hurts the legitimate\nowner.  In dealing with the piracy that occurs nowadays, many\nattempts will be made in the future in trying to prevent\nsoftware piracy.  No one single solution will ever completely\nstop computer piracy instantly.  However, if we look at the\ndifferent roots of piracy and try to tackle each problem one\nat a time, I believe we can do the next best thing for our\nfuture.</P>\n<BR>\n<UL>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://www.novell.com/Programs/Piracy.html\">Novell's Anti \nPiracy Program</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"http://gnv.ifas.ufl.edu/WWW/PIRATE/index.html\">Univ Florida \nSoftware Copyright Information</A> \n</UL>\n<HR>\n<BR>\n<H2> Bibliography</H2>\n<UL>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.digital.com/gnn/bus/hewm/intellectual_property.html\">http://www.digital.com/gnn/buus/hewm/intellectual_property.html</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.portal.com/~cyberlaw/cylw894.html\">http://www.portal.com/~cyberlaw/cylw894.html</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.express-systems.com/csminfo.htm\">http://www.express-systems.com/csminfo.htm</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.novell.com/Programs/Piracy.html\">http://www.novell.com/Programs/Piracy.html</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://gnv.ifas.ufl.edu/WWW/PIRATE/index.html\">http://gnv.ifas.ufl.edu/WWW/PIRATE/index.html</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview.html\">http://www.law.cornell.edu/usc/17/overview/html</A>\n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://www.allencol.edu/ethics.html\">http://www.allencol.edu/ethics.html</A>\n\n</UL>\n </BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
