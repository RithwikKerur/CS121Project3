I have received \na few responses stating interest in the problem  (and one good reference), \nbut alas no Solution.\n\nIn this post I intend to explain, in some detail, the Theory behind these\nEquations, in the hopes that a complete understanding of the Problem will \ngenerate a good approach to the Solution.  I welcome any and all comments \nor suggestions concerning this topic (please respond by e-mail).\n\nI realize that this article may be excessively long for a post, but I have\nfound myself unable to produce an \"abstract\" that adequately expresses the\nintriguing qualities of the subject matter. It is my hope that the content  \nof this article will justify its use of bandwidth.\n\nThanks in advance for your time.\n\nDon Mc Connell\n<A HREF=\"mailto:bdsm@fermat.wpi.edu\">bdsm@fermat.wpi.edu</A>\n\n                               HEDRONOMETRY: \n\n         The Search for Solutions to the Perfect Tetrahedron Equation\n\nSUMMARY. \"Hedronometry\" is an extension of Trigonometry to 3-Dimensions,\n         focussing on the relationships between the Angles and the Faces \n         of a Tetrahedron.  Tetrahedra have more degrees of freedom than \n         Triangles, and consequently are not uniquely determined by, say,\n         the Areas of their Faces in the way that Triangles are uniquely\n         determined by the Lengths of their Edges.  Yet there do exist a \n         number of Hedronometric analogues to Trigonometric formulae  -- \n         the \"Neo-Pythagorean Theorem\" and two \"Laws of Cosines\" to name\n         a few -- that provide vaguely familiar relationships between the\n         Faces and Angles.  These formulae are discussed first.\n            \n         Restricting our focus to \"Perfect Tetrahedra\" -- Tetrahedra for\n         opposite Edges are Orthogonal (as Vectors) -- we find ourselves\n         with a class of figures that _are_ uniquely determined by their \n         Face-Areas (up to permutation of the Faces, of course).  \n\n         The \"Perfect Tetrahedon Equation\" -- \"P.T.E.\" -- (of which the \n         \"3 'Simple' Quartics\" were versions) describes the closer ties \n         between Face-Areas and Dihedral Angles in Perfect Tetrahedra, \n         providing the key to determining the overall shape of a Tetra-\n         hedron whose Face-Areas are given.  However, even though the\n         P.T.E. represents a _nice_ relationship, its Solutions appear\n         to be anything BUT nice. I am convinced, nevertheless, that a\n         inspired simplification can be performed on the results I have\n         been able to obtain, yielding forms of the Solutions that reflect\n         the beauty of the Problem.  \n\n         The challenge I set forth, then, is to find that simplification:  \n\n    FIND THE \"NICE\" FORMS OF SOLUTIONS TO THE PERFECT TETRAHEDRON EQUATION.\n\n   Note.  \"Hedronometry\" is by no means a new subject. I understand that\n          some of the ideas presented here were developed over a century \n          ago, as aspect of \"Tetrahedrometry\". (I forget the name of the \n          Mathematician who published two volumes on the subject). The 2\n          results I mentioned (Pyth. Thm. &amp; Law of Cosines) can be found\n          in fairly recent Journal publications (e-mail for references).\n\t  But I have no idea if the problem I pose or the answers I seek\n          already exist in the literature.\n\nAlright, now to begin.\n\nNOTATION: Let the Vertices of a Tetrahedron be labelled  Q, A, B, and C.\n\t  The Faces (and their Areas) opposite these Vertices we denote \n          R, X, Y, and Z, respectively. An Edge (thought of as a Vector) \n          through points U and V we denote UV; thus the Edges are QA, QB, \n          QC, AB, BC, and CA.  We use \"| |\" for the Length of an Edge.\n          Dihedral Angles we denote like the Edges, hopefully without\n          confusion. \n\nNow although the Face-Areas X, Y, Z, and R do not define a Tetrahedron we \ndo have the following:\n\nTHE NEO-PYTHAGOREAN THEOREM:\n\n          If Tetrahedron QABC has a \"Right Corner\" at Q  (that is, if \n          Edges QA, QB, and QC are mutually perpendicular), then...\n\n                            2     2     2      2\n                           X  +  Y  +  Z   =  R\n          \n          (the Sum of the Squares of the Areas of the Leg-Faces is equal\n          to the Square of the Area of the Hypotenuse-Face).\n\n   PROOF. Exercise. It's pretty easy, requiring nothing more sophisticated\n          than Heron's Formula for Triangle Area.\n\nCOMMENT 1: Sadly, the Converse of this Theorem is not true... Having the \n           \"Sum of Squares\" relation does not guarantee the existence of\n           a Right Corner. Thus, there are \"Pythagorean Tetrahedra\" that\n           are not \"Right-Corner Tetrahedra\".\n \nCOMMENT 2: Happily, this idea extends to 'n' Dimensions as a Theorem for\n           an n-dimensional \"Right-Simplex\", where n mutually perpendicular \n           Edges meet at a Vertex.  But this is a story for another day.\n\nJust as the (ordinary) Pythagorean Theorem can be viewed as a special case \nof the Law of Cosines, so the Neo-Pythagorean Theorem is a special case of...\n\nTHE FIRST LAW OF COSINES  (\"LOC.1\"):\n\n             2     2   2   2  \n            R  =  X + Y + Z  - 2 Y Z cos QA - 2 Z X cos QB - 2 X Y cos QC\n\n   PROOF. Exercise.  This, too, is easy, though it involves a great deal\n          of symbol manipulation and a working knowledge of the formulae\n          from Spherical Trigonometry (in particular, a Law of Cosines!)\n          in order to relate Dihedral Angles to \"Face-Angles\" like &lt;AQB.\n\n COMMENT: When Q is a Right Corner, QA, QB, and QC are all Right Angles,\n          so that LOC.1 reduces to the Neo-Pythagorean Theorem.\n\nBy Symmetry, we can find similar expressions for X^2, Y^2, and Z^2 in terms\nof other Faces and \"opposite\" Dihedral Angles. The four expressions combine\nto give...\n\nTHE SECOND LAW OF COSINES (\"LOC.2\"):\n\n            2    2                      2     2    2\n           R  + X  -  2 X R cos BC  =  H  =  Y  + Z  -  2 Y Z cos QA\n \n            2    2                      2     2    2\n           R  + Y  -  2 Y R cos AC  =  J  =  Z  + X  -  2 Z X cos QB\n\n            2    2                      2     2    2\n           R  + Z  -  2 Z R cos AB  =  K  =  X  + Y  -  2 X Y cos OC\n\nCOMMENT 1: Notice that Faces R &amp; X \"bound\" Angle BC, and Faces Y &amp; Z \"bound\"\n           Angle QA;  moreover, BC and QA are \"opposite\" one another in the\n           Tetrahedron.  Similar observations hold for the other Equations.\n\nCOMMENT 2: There is a geometric interpretation of the numbers H, J, and K.\n           They are the Areas of \"Pseudo-Faces\", and can be calculated by:\n\n                      &lt;QA&gt;x&lt;BC&gt;         &lt;QB&gt;x&lt;CA&gt;         &lt;QC&gt;x&lt;AB&gt; \n                  H = ---------     J = ---------     K = ---------\n                          2                 2                 2\n\n           Where 'x' is the Cross Product.  This fact isn't very important\n           now, but it will aid discussion later.  Also, using H^2, J^2, \n           and K^2 as they are used in LOC.2 will help with simplification.\n\nCOROLLARY to LOC.2:\n                       2     2     2     2     2     2     2\n                      X  +  Y  +  Z  +  R  =  H  +  J  +  K\n\n  PROOF. Simply set the sum of the second column from the statment of \n         LOC.2 equal to the sum of the third column, then simplify using\n         the statement of LOC.1.\n\nOkay, so now we know that all information about a Tetrahedron can be gleaned\nfrom six Numbers:  X, Y, Z, R, H, J, and K, with the Corollary making one of \nthese Numbers (you choose) unnecessary.  These Areas and \"Pseudo-Areas\" give\nus Dihedral Angles, by LOC.2;  the Dihedral Angles give us Face-Angles, by\nSpherical Trigonometry;  and Face Angles together with Face Areas give us \nlengths of Edges.  Unfortunately, all 6 of these Area Numbers are virtually \nindependent of one another (but subject to a 'Triangle Inequality' of sorts).\nHowever, with \"Perfect Tetrahedra\" (defined below), we get a situation in \nwhich X, Y, Z, and R suffice to determine all information about the Tetra-\nhedron. \n\nDEFINITION: A _Perfect_Tetrahedron_ QABC is a Tetrahedron whose opposing\n            Edges are orthogonal (when thought of as Vectors).  That is,\n            if  &lt;UV&gt;  represents the Vector going through Points U and V\n            and '.' represents the Euclidean Dot-Product, then\n\n                     &lt;QA&gt;.&lt;BC&gt; = &lt;QB&gt;.&lt;CA&gt; = &lt;QC&gt;.&lt;AB&gt; = 0\n\n     NOTE:  In a Perfect Tetrahedron, the Pseudo-Faces can be computed as\n\n                      |QA||BC|       |QB||CA|       |QC||AB|\n                  H = --------   J = --------   K = --------\n                         2               2             2\n\nThe following Lemma and its Corollary will be useful.\n\n    LEMMA: Let UQV be the Angle between Edges (Vectors) QU and QV.\n\n           In a Perfect Tetrahedron QABC,\n\n                        cos BQC       cos CQA       cos AQB\n                       ---------  =  ---------  =  ---------\n                          |QA|          |QB|          |QC|\n\n    PROOF: Vector methods handle this nicely, although High School Trig\n           can do the job as well.\n\n COROLLARY to LEMMA:\n\n        The Face Angles at a Corner of a Perfect Tetrahedron are either\n        all Acute, all Right, or all Obtuse;  further, a Perfect Tetra-\n        hedron can have _at most_ one \"Right\" Corner or \"Obtuse\" Corner.\n\nBy this Corollary, we may assume that Q is not a Right Corner. Therefore,\nwe may use the Lemma to write:\n\n   |QA| = k cos BQC,  |QB| = k cos CQA,  |QC| = k cos AQB,   for some  k.\n\nUsing these facts, and the formulae for the Areas of X, Y, and Z,\n\n          |QB| |QC| sin BQC       |QC| |QA| sin CQA       |QA| |QB| sin AQB\n      X = -----------------,  Y = -----------------,  Z = -----------------, \n                  2                       2                       2\n                     \nwe can get\n\n     X    cos CQA sin BQC                       cos QB + cos QC cos QA\n    --- = --------------- = (by Spherical Trig) ----------------------\n     Y    cos BQC sin CQA                       cos QA + cos QB cos QC\n\n     Y    cos QC + cos QA cos QB    (      Z    cos QA + cos QB cos QC )\n    --- = ----------------------    (and  --- = ---------------------- ) \n     Z    cos QB + cos QC cos QA    (      X    cos QC + cos QA cos QB )\n\nNow, using the formulae for X/Y and Y/Z, as well as the Formula in LOC.1,\nwe can solve for cos QA, cos QB, and cos QC in terms of X, Y, Z, and R.\nThus, the Face Areas completely determine the Tetrahedron.  So, the only\nthing to do is solve this system of Equations...\n\n          ** THIS IS WHERE THE \"3 'SIMPLE' QUARTICS COME IN **\n\nNOTATION: Let A = cos QA, B = cos QB, and C = cos QC.  Then the System\n          we are trying to solve looks like this...\n\n            X    B + C A      Y    C + A B   (  Z    A + B C )\n           --- = -------     --- = -------   ( --- = ------- )\n            Y    A + B C      Z    B + C A   (  X    C + A B )\n \n             2     2    2    2\n            R  =  X  + Y  + Z  - 2 X Y C - 2 Z X B - 2 Y Z C\n\nMaple V (Release 2) assimilates the basic idea here quite rapidly, giving \nthe following \"Solutions\" (though in a slightly different form):\n\n                                2   2   2   2\n                 ( Y - X C ) ( X + Y + Z - R - 2 X Y C )\n             A = ---------------------------------------, \n                                 2   2\n                          2 Z ( X + Y - 2 X Y C )\n\n                                2   2   2   2\n                 ( X - Y C ) ( X + Y + Z - R  - 2 X Y C )\n             B = ----------------------------------------,\n                                 2   2\n                          2 Z ( X + Y - 2 X Y C ) \n\n            ----         3 3  4       2 2  3      2     2   2   2     ----\n           |         12 X Y  C  -  8 X Y  C  ( 2 X + 2 Y - Z - R )        |\n           |                                                              |\n           |                                                              |\n           |             /      2      2    2   2     2   2   2   2  \\    |\n           |          2 |  ( 7 X  + 7 Y  - Z - R ) ( X + Y - Z - R )  |   |\n           |   + X Y C  |                                             |   |\n           |            |                   2 2    2 2                |   |\n           |             \\            -4 ( X Y  - Z R )              /    |\n C = RootOf|                                                              |\n           |                                                              |\n           |         2   2   /      2 2   2 2       2   2   2   2  2 \\    |\n           |  - C ( X + Y ) |  4 ( X Y + Z R ) - ( X + Y + Z + R  )   |   |\n           |                 \\                                       /    |\n           |                                                              |\n           |                                                              |\n           |                 2   2   2   2      2   2   2   2             |\n           |        - X Y ( X + Y + Z - R ) ( X + Y - Z + R )  =  0       |\n            ----                                                      ----\n\nOf course, C is the hard part, and here our investigations come to a \nscreeching halt.\n\nThe Quartic Polynomial of which C is a Root is a form of the Perfect \nTetrahedron Equation.

I mention these other two \nQuartics because, while the Solutions to any _one_ of them look hopelessly\ncomplex, we can observe that, since the Solutions must satisfy the simple\nrelation shown in the LOC.2 Corollary, there must be some method in the \nmadness. \n\nTo plead this case a little more convincingly, let me remind the Reader \nthat any Quartic Equation\n                          4     3     2\n                       a q + b q + c q + d q + e = 0,\n\nhas Roots of the form\n                              b\n                      q =  - --- + (**STUFF**)\n                             4a\n\nConsequently, the Solutions to the three P.T.E.'s have the form\n\n                            2   2   2   2\n                      2    X + Y + Z + R\n                     H  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.1**) \n                                 3\n\n                            2   2   2   2\n                      2    X + Y + Z + R\n                     J  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.2**)\n                                 3 \n\n                            2   2   2   2\n                      2    X + Y + Z + R\n                     K  =  --------------  + (**STUFF.3**)\n                                 3\n                                \nThis gives that\n\n    2   2   2     2   2   2   2\n   H + J + K  =  X + Y + Z + R   +  **STUFF.1** + **STUFF.2** + **STUFF.3**\n\nIn accordance with the Corollary to LOC.2, we can conclude that\n\n             **STUFF.1** + **STUFF.2** + **STUFF.3**  =  0\n\nNow, the **STUFF**'s are pretty complicated expressions, involving complex\nnumbers and nested Radicals.  But as complicated as these thing are, they \nMUST cancel each other out in the end, and this is encouraging.  Somehow, \nsome way, these **STUFF**'s can be artfully manipulated into expressions \nthat \"obviously\" cancel.  I have searched for over 5 years for this method \nof artful manipulation, but to no avail.  Maple hasn't been much help in \nthe general case:  I have waited for over an hour at a sitting for Maple \nto churn out even the _ugly_ Solutions to the P.T.E., but the task seems \nto require a great deal more time than I can spend waiting.\n\nLet's take a specific example to show the extent of the problem for even \nsimple numerical values:\n\n   Assign: X = 1 , Y = 2 , Z = 5 , R = 9.  \n\n  COMMENT: The values are chosen to avoid some special circumstances, and \n           in the hopes that they -as prime powers- might be 'recognizable' \n           inside a complicated expression.\n\nThese give the following P.T.E. system:\n\n                      8        6          4\n                   3 H  - 444 H  + 16353 H  - 2822400  =  0\n\n                      8        6          4\n                   3 J  - 444 J  + 15345 J  - 3415104  =  0\n\n                      8        6          4\n                   3 K  - 444 K  +  5265 K  -  28224   =  0\n\nMaple solves these Equations readily.  In evaluated form, we get...\n\n                     2                               -8\n                    H  = 86.30112783 + .2120961320 10  i\n\n                     2                               -8\n                    J  = 22.08279673 - .1249277220 10  i\n\n                     2                               -6\n                    K  = 2.616075639 - .2103278201 10  i\n\n(Of course, there are really four choices for H^2, four for J^2, and four \nfor K^2, since these quantities are Roots of a Quartic.  However, one can \neasily pick out a particular set H^2, J^2, K^2 that satisfies the Corollary \nto LOC.2;  in fact the twelve total Solutions can be partitioned into four \nsuch sets.)\n\nIn complicated mess form (brace yourselves)...\n\n               3/4   (                1/2   2/3         1/3             )1/2\n   2         %2    + (  3700 %3  -  %2  ( %1   - 3684 %1   + 2047089 )  )\n  H = 37 +  ---------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     1/6  1/4\n                                2  %1   %2\n\n                3/4  (                1/2   2/3         1/3             )1/2\n   2        - %5   + ( -587708 %6 - %5  ( %4   - 4132 %4   + 1389201 )  )\n  J = 37 +  ----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    1/6  1/4\n                               2  %4   %5\n\n                3/4  (                1/2   2/3         1/3            )1/2\n   2        - %8   + ( -550708 %9 - %8  ( %7   - 8612 %7   + 329681 )  )\n  K = 37 +  ---------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    1/6  1/4\n                               2  %7   %8\n\nwhere\n                                 ______          2/3         1/3\n   %1 = 2532898313 + 2279200 i \\/416363,  %2 = %1   + 1842 %1   + 2047089, \n                                        ____\n                              %3 = 64 \\/ %1 ,\n       \n                                ______           2/3         1/3\n   %4 = 252741049 + 2507120 i \\/416363,   %5 = %4   + 2066 %4   + 1389201,\n                                        ____\n                              %6 = 64 \\/ %4 ,\n\n                               ______           2/3          1/3\n   %7 = 119179929 + 227920 i \\/416363,   %8 = %7    + 4306 %7   + 329681,\n                                        ____\n                              %9 = 64 \\/ %7\n\nNotice that this could be simplified a little bit (although Maple doesn't \nseem to realize this fact); more importantly, observe that the **STUFF**'s \nare the fractions following the 37's in each line...and these **STUFF**'s \nhave to cancel; but getting them into \"obvious cancelling form\" requires \nsome bit of insight that I just haven't acquired.\n\nIn this numerical case, we can perhaps see better that the problem becomes \none of \"denesting\" the nested Radicals. \"Denesting\" is a method of algebraic \nmanipulation with its core in the theory of Field Extensions.  As an example,\n               ____________\n              /        ___     can be \"denested\" to     ___     ___\n            \\/ 5 + 2 \\/ 6                             \\/ 2  + \\/ 3 .\n\nSusan Landau -- in \"Simplification of Nested Radicals\", SIAM J. Comput., \n21 (Feb.1992) 85-110 -- explains Denesting and provides an algorithm for \ndenesting arbitrarily \"deep\" Radical Expressions. (I freely admit that I \ndo not fully comprehend the steps involved, but I have only begun to look \ninto this avenue of investigation.) I am not sure if the algorithm will \nreadily transfer to the general X-Y-Z-R case, since the steps require \nknowledge of Irreducible Polynomials and such things, which I should think \nwould be extremely difficult to determine when dealing with variables \ninstead of _numbers_.  At this point, I'd be happy to see the denested \nforms of the three Expressions above; examination of these might provide \nsome valuable insight to the general case, fostering a good guess or two\nthat could save a lot of time.\n\nHaving mentioned time, I find that perhaps I should not waste much more of \nthe Reader's.  I'll close up this post with a listing of some Special Case \nSolutions to the P.T.E.'s....Perhaps someone can discern the Grand Pattern \nfrom these scattered examples.  The Solutions for H^2, J^2, and K^2 are \nordered such that repective Solutions for these three quantities satisfy \nthe Corollary to LOC.2. Some of the Roots are extraneous (see discussion \nbelow), and '**' represent Roots that are too complicated to write out.\n\n   CASE                      ROOTS OF P.T.E.s         \n\n                                               2     2 \n\"EQUI-HEDRAL\"              2     2     2    4 X   4 X   \nX = Y = Z = R             H  =  J  =  K  =  ---,  ---, 0, 0   \n                                             3     3\n\n                             +-+-+-+-+-+\n                                            2   2     2   2\n\"TRISO-HEDRAL\"           2    2     2    3 X + R   3 X + R\nX = Y = Z   R           H  = J  =  K  =  --------, --------, 0, 0 \n                                             3         3\n                             +-+-+-+-+-+\n                                 \n   \"DOUBLY            2   2   2     ___    2   2     ___         2        2\n BISO-HEDRAL\"        H = X + R + 2 / S ,  X + R - 2 / S , (X + R), (X - R)\n X = Y, Z = R            --------------   --------------\n                              3                  3\n\n                      2   2   2     ___    2   2     ___         2        2\n                     J = X + R + 2 / S ,  X + R - 2 / S , (X - R), (X + R)\n                         --------------   ----------------\n                               3                 3\n\n                      2       2   2   ___          2   2   ___\n                     K = 4 ( X + R - / S  ),  4 ( X + R + / S  ), 0, 0\n                         ------------------   ------------------\n                                 3                    3\n                 \n                          4   2 2   4\n                     S = X - X R + R\n\n                             +-+-+-+-+-+\n\n  \"PYTHAGOREAN\"          2     2   2\n  2   2   2   2         H  =  Y + Z,  **, **, **   \n R = X + Y + Z                                      \n                         2     2   2                \n                        J  =  X + Z,  **, **, **    \n                                                    \n                         2     2   2                \n                        K  =  X + Y,  **, **, **    \n\n                              +-+-+-+-+-+\n\n    \"FLAT\"               2            2\nR = X + Y + Z           H  = ( Y + Z ), **, **, ** \n              \n                         2            2\n                        J  = ( X + Z ), **, **, **\n\n                         2            2\n                        K  = ( X + Y ), **, **, **\n\nNOTE: I should mention something about extraneous Roots.  In the Root \n      List for each of H^2, J^2, and K^2 in the cases above, the last \n      three Roots can be considered extraneous. Let me explain.\n\n      Notice that if  H = 0, then (by the formula given for calculating \n      H from the Cross Product) either |QA| = 0  or  |BC| = 0; so either \n      Y = Z = 0 or X = R = 0. Similarly, if J = 0, then either X = Z = 0\n      or Y = R = 0;  and if  K = 0, then either  X = Y = 0 or Z = R = 0.\n\n      Now the Triso-hedral/Equi-hedral case, the '0' Roots for the triple\n      H, J, K imply that X = Y = Z = R = 0.  But in this case the formula \n      in the \"first\" entries of the Root List give us the answer.  Thus,\n      there is no need for the '0' entries.  Moreover, the \"second\" entry\n      is unnecessary since it simply copies the \"first\". \n\n      In the Doubly Biso-hedral case, H^2 can equal (X - R)^2 only if we\n      have X = Y = Z = R = 0, which means that H's value can be computed\n      from its \"first\" Root formula, and so can the corresponding values\n      of J and K;  similarly, for when J^2 = (X - R)^2.  So the last two\n      entries in these Root Lists are extraneous. Moreover, one can show\n      that  X^2 + R^2 - 2sqrt(X^4 - X^2*R^2 + R^2)  is non-positive, and\n      reaches zero only when X^2 = R^2; but if these are identical, then \n      the \"second\" Root formulae for H^2 and J^2 yield 0, so that we get\n      X = Y = Z = R = 0, and find that, again, the \"first\" Root formulae \n      suffice.\n\n      In the Pythagorean case, one can use arguments about Edges to show\n      that the Tetrahedron _must_ be a Right-Corner Tetrahedron;  that is,\n      the Neo-Pythagorean is an \"if and only if\" Proposition in the realm\n      of Perfect Tetrahedra. (Another nice thing about Perfect Tetrahedra!) \n      Thus, A = B = C = 0, and the \"first\" Roots give the Solutions, so we \n      don't even need the '**'s.\n\n      One can show that in the Flat Case, the Tetrahedron is in fact flat:\n      all Faces lie in the same Plane, and the Vertex Q lies at the Ortho-\n      centre of Face R. Here, H must be Y + Z, J must be X + Z, and K must\n      be X + Y (by Edge arguments).  The '**' Solutions in this case are\n      extraneous as well.\n\n      Is it true in general that 3 of the Solutions for each of H^2, J^2, \n      and K^2 are extraneous?  I don't know.  Numerical experimentation has \n      always lead to twelve values (all together) which could be grouped \n      into H-J-K triplets satisfying LOC.2.  Some of the numbers have been \n      negative or even complex which _does_ make them extraneous as Area-\n      Values. (In the numerical example above, it may be that the Imaginary\n      components are _supposed_ to be zero.) My GUESS is that there is only \n      one valid triplet (except in special cases where we have repeated \n      Roots), and that \"3/4\"s of each P.T.E. contains useless information,  \n      but I don't know for sure yet if that is the case.\n\nWell, anyway, that's about all I care to inflict upon you for now.  Anyone\ninterested in other aspects of Hedronometry (such as its analogue in \nHyperbolic Space among other things) should feel free to inquire.  I have\na little notebook full of bits and pieces (but nothing especially *deep*).\n\nLet me close now by saying that, although it is *trivial* Mathematics, \nHedronometry has been a pet project of mine since my High School Days.\nI've been struggling with various forms of the P.T.E. off and on for\nnearly 10 years, and I'd very much like to get its Solution pinned down.\nSo I appreciate all the help I can get in this matter.

He has also restricted to the case where every\npair of opposite edges is perpendicular and wants the dihedral angles\nin terms of the four areas.  The straightforward approach with vector\ncalculus in R^3 yields algebraic equations for the cosines of the\nangles that seem unnecessarily complicated.\n\nIn article &lt;1lcdgd$shl@bigboote.WPI.EDU&gt; you write:\n&gt;THE FIRST LAW OF COSINES  (\"LOC.1\"):\n&gt;\n&gt;             2     2   2   2  \n&gt;            R  =  X + Y + Z  - 2 Y Z cos QA - 2 Z X cos QB - 2 X Y cos QC\n&gt;\n&gt;   PROOF.

X,Y,Z, and R are your four areas, and let\ncAB be the cosine of the angle between faces with area A and B.  The\nkey to this equation is the shadow principle:  At high noon, a plate\nwith area A at an angle alpha from the ground casts a shadow of area\ncos(alpha) A.  By resting the tetrahedron on the ground on each \nface and applying the shadow principle, it follows that:\n\nR = cRX X + cRY Y + cRZ Z\nX = cRX R + cXY Y + cXZ Z\nY = cYX X + cRY R + cYZ Z\nZ = cZX X + cZY Y + cRZ R\n\nNow multiply each equation by the left-hand side and subtract the last\nthree equations from the first.\n\nThe real lesson here is that you can describe a tetrahedron by\na 4 x 4 symmetric matrix of numbers:\n\n(     R^2, -cRX R X, -cRY R Y, -cRZ R Z)\n(-cRX R X,      X^2, -cXY X Y, -cXZ X Z)\n(-cRY R Y, -cXY X Y,      Y^2, -cYZ Y Z)\n(-cRZ R Z, -cXZ X Z, -cYZ Y Z,      Z^2)\n\nAs long as all four rows add to zero and the matrix is positive\nsemidefinite (in other words v^T M v <U>&gt;</U> 0 always), it corresponds to an\nactual Euclidean tetrahedron.  Your three pseudo-areas (cross-products\nof opposite edges) should be somewhere in this matrix also, but I have\nto think about exactly where.

A k-dimensional simplex has k+1 (affinely independent) vertices,\n(k+1)k/2! edges, (k+1)k(k-1)/3! two dimensional faces, and so forth up to\nk+1 (k-1)-dimensional faces.  Just as triangles can exist in E^3,\nk-simplices can exist in E^n for any n &gt;= k.\n\nAny convex polytope (the generalization of polygons and polyhedra to E^n)\ncan be partitioned into simplices (just as any convex polygon can be\npartitioned into triangles), so in principle if you can compute the volume\nof arbitrary simplices, you can compute the volume of any convex polytope.\n\nThere are several pretty and easily implemented formulae which give\nthe volume of a k-dimensional simplex sitting in euclidean n-space, S,\nin terms of different kinds of given information, such as the coordinates\nof the vertices  or the lengths of the edges.  These formulae can be used\nby anyone who knows how to compute a determinant, although software such\nas Mathematica will probably be needed to evaluate really large\ndeterminants.\n\nI will write Vol_k for ``k-dimensional volume'' (really k-dimensional\nLebesgue measure, for those who know what this means); thus Vol_1 means\nlength, Vol_2 means area, and so forth.  Unless stated otherwise, S\nwill denote a k-dimensional simplex in E^n, where n \\geq k.\nVol_k(S) will mean the k-dimensional volume of S.\nA hyperplane in E^n is an (n-1)-dimensional plane.\n\n1.

Thanks to David for archiving it as\npart of his impressive collection.\n\nI thought I would post two informational updates here:\n\nFirst:  I am no longer at Worcester Polytechnic Institute or the\nUniversity of Washington, by the way;  my current e-mail address\nis   mcconnel @ vvm . com (without the spaces ... I'm just a bit\nparanoid about address-harvesters).  Incidentally, I promised\nreferences to anyone who e-mailed me about the topic ... in the\nyears since the post, I've lost track of those references. Sorry.\n\nSecond:  I essentially \"solved\" the Perfect Tetrahedron Equations\n(PTEs) recently.  At least, I solved something equivalent to the\nproblem posed by them:  I found a Heron-like formula that gives\nthe volume of a perfect tetrahedron in terms of the areas of its\nfaces.  (A \"perfect\" tetrahedron is one whose pairs of opposite\nedges determine pairs of orthogonal vectors.)  With face areas\nand volume known, various substitutions into other formulae can\nyield things like dihedral and face angles, and areas of \"pseudo-\nfaces\" (the primary target of the previously posted PTEs);  thus,\nall aspects of a Perfect Tetrahedron are derivable from the areas\nof its faces.\n\nMy solution isn't explicit, but is encoded in a single quartic,\ninstead of the four I'd given before;  the one quartic is far more\ncomplicated to express than the other four, but I haven't done a\ngreat deal of analysis to see what I can fix up.\n\nHere 'tis:\n\n   Let X, Y, Z, and R  be the areas of faces of a perfect\n   tetrahedron, and let  W = 81 * volume^4 .

It's interesting that this approach seems to invariably \nlead to a quartic equation (although yours is the first I've seen \nwhere the quartic is in terms of the volume itself, rather than\none of the edge lengths).  \n\n================================================================\nIn general there is no complete generalization of Heron's formula\ngiving the volume of a general tetrahedron in terms of the areas\nof its faces, because the face areas don't uniquely determine the\nvolume (in contrast to the case of triangles, where the three\nedge lengths determine the area).\n\nHowever, it IS possible to derive a \"Heron's formula\" for \ntetrahedrons if we restrict ourselves to just those that would \nfit as the \"hypotenuse face\" of a right 4D solid.  (Notice that \nEVERY triangle is the face of a right tetrahedron, which explains\nwhy Heron's formula is complete for triangles).\n\nTo review, remember that Heron's formula for triangles is essentially\nequivalent to Pythagoras' Theorem for right tetrahedrons.  If A_xyo,\nA_xoz, and A_oyz denote the areas of the three orthogonal faces of a\nright tetrahedron, and A_xyz denotes the area of the \"hypotenuse \nface\", then it's easy to show that\n\n   (A_xyz)^2  =  (A_xyo)^2  +  (A_xoz)^2  +  (A_oyz)^2         (1)\n\nThis is not only a generalization of Pythagoras's Theorem, it's also\nessentially Heron's formula for triangles.  Note that if a,b,c denote\nthe three orthogonal edge lengths of the tetrahedron, then the areas\nA_xyo, A_xoz, and A_oyz are simply  ab/2, ac/2, and bc/2. Furthermore,\nthe edges of the hypotenuse face d,e,f are directly related to a,b,c\naccording to the 2D Pythagorean theorem\n\n                     a^2 + b^2  = d^2\n                     a^2 + c^2  = e^2                         (2)\n                     b^2 + c^2  = f^2\n\nso we can express the squares of the areas A_xyo, A_xoz, A_oyz in\nequation (1) in terms of d^2, e^2, and f^2 to give the ordinary\nHeron's formula explicitly.\n\nIncidentally, it might be (and has been) argued that this derivation\ndoes not apply to obtuse triangles, because the \"hypotenuse face\" of\na right tetrahedron is necessarily acute (i.e., each of its angles \nmust be less than 90 degrees).  However, ANY triangle can be the \nhypotenuse face of a right tetrahedron, provided the orthogonal edge\nlengths and areas are allowed to be imaginary.  (It's interesting\nto speculate on whether the ancient Greeks might have been aware of \nthis aspect of the problem.)\n\nAnyway, we can do the same thing for tetrahedrons based on the\ngeneralized Pythagorean theorem for volumes of *right* 4D solids\n\n (V_wxyz)^2 = (V_wxyo)^2 + (V_wxoz)^2 + (V_woyz)^2 + (V_oxyz)^2   (3)\n\nIf we let a,b,c,d denote the orthogonal edge lengths of the 4D\nsolid, then the volumes of the four orthogonal \"faces\" are simply\nabc/6, abd/6, acd/6, and bcd/6, so equation (3) can be rewritten\nas\n\n (V_wxyz)^2 = (abc/6)^2 + (abd/6)^2 + (acd/6)^2 + (bcd/6)^2      (3')\n\nAlso, the areas of the four faces of our \"hyoptenuse\" solid can be \nexpressed in terms of a,b,c,d by means of the 3D Pythagorean theorem\n\n         (ab)^2 + (ac)^2 + (bc)^2 = 4(A_1)^2\n         (ab)^2 + (ad)^2 + (bd)^2 = 4(A_2)^2                     (4)\n         (ac)^2 + (ad)^2 + (cd)^2 = 4(A_3)^2\n         (bc)^2 + (bd)^2 + (cd)^2 = 4(A_4)^2\n\nThus, given the four face areas A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, we have four\nequations in the four unknowns a,b,c,d, so we can solve for these\nvalues and then compute the area using (3').\n\nThis is the point at which people usually turn away from this\napproach, for two reasons: [1] everything we're doing is restricted\nto the special tetrahedrons that can serve as the hypotenuse of a \n\"right\" 4D simplex, so we're certainly not going to end up with a \ngeneral formula applicable to every tetrahedron (and such formulas \nare already available anyway via the usual determinants), and [2] it\nturns out to be somewhat messy to solve the set of equations (4).\n\nPressing on anyway, we can reduce (4) to a single quartic in the\nsquare of any of the four variables a,b,c or d.  Arbitrarily\nselecting c, and letting A,B,C,D denote 4 times the squares of\nthe face areas (i.e., the right hand sides of equations (4)),\nwe can express the quartic in x=c^2 with coefficients that are\nfunctions of B and the elementary symmetric functions of A,C,D\n\n       s1 = A+C+D       s2 = AC+AD+CD      s3 = ACD\n\nIn these terms the quartic for x=c^2 is\n\n                                                  [12B] x^4 \n                       +   [3s1^2 - 12s2 + 14Bs1 - B^2] x^3\n     +  [2B(s1^2 + 6s2) - B^2 s1 - s1^3 + 4s1s2 - 36s3] x^2\n + [2B(s1s2 + 6s3) - B^2 s2 + 4s2^2 - s1^2 s2 - 12s1s3] x\n                                        - [s3 (s1-B)^2]   =   0\n\nOf course, the analagous quartics can be given for a^2, b^2, and\nd^2, but once we have any one of them we can more easily compute\nthe others.  For example, given c we can compute b from the relation\n                          ___________________\n                         / (c^2 + A)(c^2 + D)\n           b = -c  +-   / -------------------\n                      \\/      (c^2 + C)\n\nand the values of a and d follow easily, allowing us to compute\nthe volume using equation (3').  It would be nice if we could express\nthe volume as an explicit function of the face areas, but I don't\nknow if such a formula exists.\n  _______________________________________________________________\n |  MathPages  /*\\     <A HREF=\"http://www.seanet.com/~ksbrown/\">http://www.seanet.com/~ksbrown/</A>           |\n |            /   \\                                              |\n |___________/\"I know thee not, old man.
