Specifically, with the current diversity of\nclients for the Web (and we can only expect to see more!), it's become\nimportant to write HTML that will look good on <STRONG>any</STRONG>\nclient, and not just on the specific client which the author may have\naccess to.<P>\n\nTo that end, there are a few solutions.  One approach is this one --\ndocuments which point out common errors one might make in the\ncomposition of HTML.  The other approach is software based -- a\n\"lint\"-like program for catching semantic errors in HTML, and perhaps\neven correcting them.<P>\n\nThe thing to bear in mind is that, if you follow these guidelines,\nyour document may not look as best as it possibly can on a particular\nbrowser.  However, it also will not look ugly on any browser, which is\nthe risk you take by disregarding these recommendations and tweaking\nyour HTML for, say, Mosaic.  Unfortunately, Mosaic may render things\ndifferently from Lynx which may render things differently from TkWWW,\netc, etc, etc.  These guidelines, in essence, should ensure the\n<EM>best fit across the space of all possible browsers</EM>, if you\nget my drift.<P>\n\nThis document does <STRONG>not</STRONG> purport to be a style guide,\nor a beginner's manual to HTML.  <A HREF=\"#furtherinfo\">Fine documents\nalready exists for these purposes.</A><P>\n\n<EM>(Note: This document is fairly stable, but still open to\namendment.

Specifically, this would include anything which\nshould routinely be done in the creation of documents for the benefit\nof both reader and author.\n\n<H3><A NAME=\"sigs\">Signing Documents, and Time-Stamps</A></H3>\n\nIt is a good idea to sign and date all documents served on the Web, so\nthat people viewing the documents can form some impression of the\nauthority of the document (i.e. how recent it is, and how reliable the\ninformation provider is).  For example, <A HREF=\"#signature\">this\ndocument has been signed.</A><P>\n\nAlso, when dating a document, try to avoid ambiguous formats.  For\nexample, both the month/day/year and day/month/year format are used on\nthe web -- so is \"4/2/94\" April 2 or February 4?  A solution to this\nis to use the name of the month (or an abbreviation).<P>\n\nFinally, the best way to sign a document is to to include a <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/LINK.html\">LINK</A>\nelement of type \"made\" in your <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/HEAD.html\">HEAD</A>\nelement.  For example:<P>\n\n<PRE>\n&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;TITLE&gt;This is my Title&lt;/TITLE&gt;\n&lt;LINK REV=\"made\" HREF=\"mailto:author@some.site.org\"&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n</PRE>\n\nFor an example, look at the HTML source of this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<H2><A NAME=\"ce\">Common Errors</A></H2>\n\nThis section details common errors in HTML composition, that may lead\nto documents which are not fully device-independent.  The behaviors of\nthese errors are undefined, so certain browsers may render them as\nintended <STRONG>but not all browsers are guaranteed of doing\nso</STRONG>.  Therefore, these mistakes should be avoided, even if\nyour browser of choice renders your documents correctly.\n\n<H3>Contents</H3>\n\n<UL>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#break\">Paragraph Break Errors</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#entity\">Character and Entity Reference Errors</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#url\">URL Errors</A>\n\n<UL>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#url-dirs\">Directory Reference Errors</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#url-fqdn\">Not Using Fully Qualified Domain Names</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#url-rel\">Improper Use of Relative URLs</A>\n</UL>\n\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#quote\">Missing Quotes in Start Tags</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#endtag\">Missed End Tags</A>\n</UL>\n\n<H3><A NAME=\"break\">Paragraph Break Errors</A></H3>\n\n<em>This is probably the most prevalent kind of error, and is the number\none culprit in cases of ugly HTML rendering.  If you fix nothing else,\nfix these!</em>\n\nPerhaps the biggest misconception about the &lt;P&gt; element is that\nit signals an end-of-paragraph, rather then a paragraph break.  <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/P.html\">According\nto the specification</A>, \"&lt;P&gt; is used between two pieces of\ntext which otherwise would be flowed together\".<P>\n\nIn most cases this is not important -- functionally, the &lt;P&gt;\nserves as an end-of-paragraph marker.  However, in certain contexts,\nuse of &lt;P&gt; should be avoided, such as directly before or after\nany other element which already implies a paragraph break.  To wit,\nthe &lt;P&gt; element <EM>should not be placed either\n<STRONG>before</STRONG> or <STRONG>after</STRONG> the <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Headings.html\">headings</A>,\n<A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/HR.html\">HR</A>\n(can I get a ruling on this?  people don't handle HR consistently... X\nMosaic has no white space before or after, and Lynx appears to put\nwhite space after),\n<A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/ADDRESS.html\">ADDRESS</A>,\n<A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/BLOCKQUOTE.html\">BLOCKQUOTE</A>,\nor <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/PRE.html\">PRE</A>.</EM>\n<P>\n\nIt should also not be placed immediately before or after a <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Lists.html\">list\nelement</A> of any stripe.  That is, a &lt;P&gt; should not be used to mark the\nend-of-text for &lt;LI&gt;, &lt;DT&gt; or &lt;DD&gt;.  These elements\nalready imply paragraph breaks.<P>\n\n<H4><A NAME=\"p-caveats\">Caveats</A></H4>\n\nSome clarifications on the above might be in order.  One is the\nthe difficulties of rendering appropriate white space by a browser.\nWhile it is true that all of the entities mentioned above imply a\nparagraph break, this only occassionally means that they also imply\nwhite space between sections -- this depends on the browser.  So,\nwhile you might feel inclined to add a &lt;P&gt; in order to fix white\nspace problems, please think twice and avoid it if you can.<P>\n\nAlso, when using the glossary list (<A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Lists.html#z32\">DL</A>),\nplease try to avoid using multiple DD's (definitions of terms) in\norder to provide multiple entries for a term (DT).  Instead, use a\n&lt;P&gt; marker between paragraphs in a definition.  The use of a DD\n(definition) without a matching DT (term) is illegal, although a DT\nwithout a DD can be used without dire consequences.<P>\n\nAll clear now?\n\n<h3><A NAME=\"entity\">Character and Entity Reference Errors</A></h3>\n\nSimply put, a <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Text.html#z4\">character\nreference</A> and an <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Text.html#z5\">entity\nreference</A> are ways to represent information that might otherwise\nbe interpreted as a markup tag.  For instance, in order to represent\n&lt;P&gt; in this text, I had to use <CODE>&amp;lt;P&amp;gt;</CODE> in\nmy raw HTML.  There are currently <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Entities.html\">five\nentities for this purpose in HTML</A>, as well as several entities\nwhich allow encoding of the <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/ISOlat1.html\">ISO\nLatin-1 Character Set</A>.<P>\n\nThe most common error in the use of references is to leave off the\ntrailing semicolon.  Also, no additional spaces are needed before or\nafter the entity/character reference.\n\n<h3><A NAME=\"url\">URL Errors</A></h3>\n\nAnother misunderstood aspect of HTML is in the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/url-primer.html\">composition of\nURL's</A>.\n\n<H4><A NAME=\"url-dirs\">Directory Reference Errors</A></H4>\n\nOne grey area involves references to directories.  It is\npossible to request an index of a directory from an HTTP server.  The\ntypical response from the server is to either return a pregenerated\nindex document (which is often the document \"index.html\" in the\nreferenced directory), or to construct an HTML document on the fly\nwhich contains a listing of all files in the directory.  However, when\nmaking such a directory reference, <EM>it is important to make sure to\nhave a trailing slash on the URL</EM>.  That is, if you were to\nrequest the index of the directory which this document resides in, you\nwould want to refer to it as <A\nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/\">\nhttp://www.willamette.edu/html-composition/</A>, not as <A\nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/html-composition\">\nhttp://www.willamette.edu/html-composition</A>.\n<P>\n\nSome servers are able to catch these errors, and provide\nredirection to the proper URL, but it's best to get the URL right in\nthe first place -- notably because not all browsers support\ntransparent redirection.<P>\n\n<H4><A NAME=\"url-fqdn\">Not Using Fully Qualified Domain Names</A></H4>\n\nProblems can arise when the hostnames in URLs aren't fully qualified\nIn local networks, you can usually refer to your own machines simply\nby their names -- for instance, here at Willamette we refer to our\nlocal WWW server as \"www\".  However, the server's FQDN (fully qualified\ndomain name) is \"www.willamette.edu\".  The FQDN provides enough\ninformation that any host, anywhere on the Internet, can find this\nparticular machine.  (It's like trying to find all the Vermeers in New\nYork :).<P>\n\nWhat happens is that an HTML might construct a link that looks like\nthis:<P>\n\n<CODE>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www/~jtilton/metanoia/\"&gt;Metanoia -- A\nChange In Spirit&lt;/A&gt;</CODE><P>\n\nwhich produces a link to <A\nHREF=\"http://www/~jtilton/metanoia/\">Metanoia -- A Change In\nSpirit</A> that will only work for people in the local network that that\nmachine is on.  A correct link would look like this, instead:<P>\n\n<CODE>&lt;A HREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/metanoia/\"&gt;Metanoia&lt;/A&gt;</CODE><P>\n\nwhich would allow all of you who are interested in <A\nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/metanoia/\">Metanoia</A> to\nactually follow the link.<P>\n\nThis leads almost directly into:\n\n<H4><A NAME=\"url-rel\">Improper Use of Relative URLs</A></H4>\n\nFinally, a brief section on relative URLs.  It is possible to\nconstruct a \"relative\" URL, which gives you the following advantages:\n\n<UL>\n<LI> It's shorter.\n<LI> It makes a collection of documents which are linked together more\nportable (easier to move from directory to directory, or server to server).\n</UL>\n\nHowever, relative URLs can also break things.<P>\n\nA relative URL is a URL which doesn't contain all the necessary parts\nof a \"full\" URL (scheme, host, path information).  There's a large\nnumber of things which might fit this description!  The browser will\ntry to assume the parts that have been \"left out\" by using the information\nfrom the URL of the document which contains the link.  However, not\nall browsers will make these assumptions in the same way.  Here's a\nshort list of what's \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" (based on experience, and not\non a specification anywhere -- unfortunately).\n\n<DL>\n\n<DT> <STRONG>Safe:</STRONG> Same directory relative URL's\n<DD> A reference to a document in the same logical directory (such as\n<A HREF=\"\">&lt;A HREF=\"strict-html-gp.html\"&gt;Good\nPractices&lt;/A&gt;</A>) is safe.  This kind of reference, roughly\nspeaking, contains no \"/\"'s.\n\n<DT> <STRONG>Safe:</STRONG> Same server relative URL's\n<DD> A reference to a document in the same server (such as <A\nHREF=\"/~jtilton/\">&lt;A HREF=\"/~jtilton/\"&gt;Eric's\nHyplan&lt;/A&gt;</A>) is also safe.  This kind of reference, roughly\nspeaking, will begin with a \"/\".  (It will also be semi-absolute, in\nthat it starts at the top of that server's directory structure...)\n\n<DT> <STRONG>Unclear:</STRONG> Most other kinds of relative URLs <DD>\nReferences such as &lt;A HREF=\"~jtilton/euphonium.html\"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;\ncan be dangerous -- sometimes browsers will interpret that as meaning\n\"go up one directory level, find the directory '~jtilton', and then\nfind 'euphonium.html' in it.\"  And sometimes they won't.<P>\n\nCurrently, I don't understand this problem well enough to speak about\nit.  I will try and get a canonical answer when next I have the energy\nto update this document.\n\n<DT> <STRONG>Unsafe:</STRONG> \"file://localhost/...\"\n<DD> It's also possible to have a reference to\n\"file://localhost/some/file/pathname\".  What this does is references\nthe file described on the <EM>local host of whoever is browsing the\ndocument.</EM> Which is why a reference to <A\nHREF=\"file://localhost/etc/motd\">&lt;A\nHREF=\"file://localhost/etc/motd\"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;</A> will display the\nmessage of the day on your machine, not the message of the day on my\nmachine.  Unless you know what you are doing, these references will\nreally mess up your documents.\n\n</DL>\n\n<EM>(This sub-section isn't written very well, I fear.  If anyone has any\nbetter copy, I'll gladly put it here instead. -et/April 7, 1994)</EM>\n\n<H3><A NAME=\"quote\">Missing Quotes in Start Tags</A></H3>\n\nOne common error that I used to make all the time (I use Marc\nAndreesen's <A\nHREF=\"ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Web/html/elisp/html-mode.el\">html-mode.el</A>\nfor Emacs these days -- I had to learn Emacs, but now it's so much\neasier to write HTML!) was to leave off a quote in my start tags.  For\nexample, this reference to the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/euphonium.html\">euphonium,\nking of instruments</A> should look like:<P>\n\n<CODE>&lt;A\nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/euphonium.html\"&gt;\n</CODE><P>\n\nbut I would often use<P>\n\n<CODE>&lt;A\nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/euphonium.html&gt;\n</CODE><P>\n\ninstead.  I suppose by the end of that huge URL, I'd forgotten it was\nsupposed to be quoted.  The behaviour of browsers upon encountering\nthis varies -- some display a proper link, but you can't follow it,\nwhile others actually eat up huge portions of the following text,\nthinking it to be part of the URL.\n\n<H3><A NAME=\"endtag\">Missed End Tags</A></H3>\n\nMany of the <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html\">HTML\nelements</A> contain information within them.  For example,\n<CODE>&lt;em&gt;emphasized text&lt;/em&gt;</CODE> would be rendered as\n<EM>emphasized text</EM>.  There is a start tag\n(<CODE>&lt;EM&gt;</CODE>), some content (which may include text, and\nin some cases, other nested elements), and an end tag\n(<CODE>&lt;/EM&gt;</CODE>, indicated by the &lt;/).  A common mistake\nis to miss the / in the end tag.  All elements (except empty elements,\nsee next paragraph) must be terminated by an end tag -- otherwise,\nundefined behavior may occur.<P>\n\nSome HTML elements may be empty, such as &lt;P&gt; and &lt;HR&gt;\n(CERN provides an <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Text.html\">extended\ndiscussion on element content</A>).  If this is the case, there is no\nneed for an end tag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2><A NAME=\"tta\">Things to Avoid</A></h2>\n\nThis section concentrates on mistakes in HTML authoring that are more problems\nof aesthetics then problems of device-independence.\n\n<H3>Contents</H3>\n\n<UL>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#mixing\">Mixing HEAD and BODY Elements</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#tags\">Using White Space Around Element Tags</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#headers\">Heading Usage</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#linktext\">Meaningless Link Text</A>\n<LI> <A HREF=\"#logical\">Physical vs. Logical Character Emphasis</A>\n</UL>\n\n<h3><A NAME=\"mixing\">Mixing HEAD and BODY Elements</A></h3>\n\nThe <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html\">section on\nHTML elements</A> in the HTML\nspecification</A> indicates that HTML documents should not mix those\nelements which belong in the <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Elements/HEAD.html\">HEAD</A> of\na document with those which belong in the BODY</A>.\nThe urgency of this suggestion is unclear, but it does make a certain\namount of common sense for readability of HTML code, and for\nconformance with possible future browsers which may not support the\nmixing of these elements.  Essentially, it lacks serious style points &gt;=).\n\n<h3><A NAME=\"tags\">Using White Space Around Element Tags</A></h3>\n\nIn general, the use of white space around element tags should be\navoided.  If white space immediately follows a start tag, for example,\nthe style changes implied by that element may be applied to the\ninitial space, as well.  For instance, &lt;A\nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/\"&gt; CZeCh THIZ 0uT\n&lt;/A&gt; would be rendered as <A\nHREF=\"http://www.willamette.edu/~jtilton/\"> CZeCh THIZ 0uT </A>.  On\nsome browsers, there may be white space around the anchor, which adds\nunwanted unsightliness to the rendering, and may lessen the impact of\nthe document.  <EM>(This comment really applies to white space immediately\nfollowing start tags, and immediately preceding end tags)</EM>.\n\n<h3><A NAME=\"headers\">Heading Usage</A></h3>\n\nThe <A HREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html\">HTML\nspecification</A> points out that a <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Headings.html\">heading</A>\nshould not be more then one level below the heading which preceded it.\nThat is, &lt;H3&gt; should not follow &lt;H1&gt;, etc.<P>\n\nAlso, it is pointed out that \"a heading element implies all the font\nchanges, paragraph breaks before and after, and white space (for\nexample) necessary to render the heading\".  Extra highlighting\nelements are discouraged, therefore.\n\n<H3><A NAME=\"linktext\">Meaningless Link Text</A></H3>\n\nWhen creating documents, make sure that your links are meaningful\n-- that is, that they <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/Printable.html\">avoid\nonline-specific references</A>, and that they <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/ReadableText.html\">don't\ndetract from readability</A>.  The text of your links should flow well\nin the context of the rest of your text <EM>(especially avoid the <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/ReadableText.html\">click\nhere</A> syndrome!)</EM>, and your text should also be able to stand\nalone as a <A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Provider/Style/Printable.html\">printable\ndocument</A>.<P>\n\nIn other words, avoid using sentences like, \"You can find out more\ninformation about cows by clicking <A\nHREF=\"ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/docs/about-the-net/libsoft/agguide.dos\">here</A>\".  (This\nis also bad because it refers to \"clicking\", which assumes that\neveryone is using a mouse with their browser!)  A much better\nalternative is \"<A\nHREF=\"ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/docs/about-the-net/libsoft/agguide.dos\">More\ninformation about cows</A> is available.\"\n\n<h3><A NAME=\"logical\">Physical vs. Logical Character Emphasis</A></h3>\n\nSince HTML (and also SGML) is designed to be a device independent language for\ndescribing the content of documents, most of the elements within it\naren't intended to give direct control to the author over how the\nfinal page layout will look.  The major exceptions to this are in the\n<A\nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Highlighting.html\">character\nhighlighting</A> elements.<P>\n\nThere are two types of character highlighting elements -- physical and\nlogical.  The physical styles involve things like \"italic font\",\n\"boldface\", etc; while the logical styles are things like \"emphasis\",\n\"citation\", \"strong\", etc.  It is <STRONG>strongly\nrecommended</STRONG> that you employ the logical styles rather than\nthe physical styles in your documents.  Using &lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt; to\nrender text in italics will only be effective on those browsers which\nare capable of displaying italics -- which all browsers are not\nguaranteed to do.  It is far better to encode semantic content -- to\ndescribe things in terms of logical styles -- and then allow the\nbrowser to display that semantic structure as best it can, given its\ndisplay capabilities.<P>\n\nSo, instead of\n\n<DL>\n<DT> <i>&lt;I&gt;italics&lt;/I&gt;</i>\n<DD> you might use <EM>&lt;EM&gt;emphasized&lt;/EM&gt;</EM>, or a\n<CITE>&lt;CITE&gt;citation&lt;/CITE&gt;</CITE>, and instead of\n<DT> <B>&lt;B&gt;bold&lt;/B&gt;</B>\n<DD> you might use <STRONG>&lt;STRONG&gt;strong&lt;/STRONG&gt;</STRONG>.\n</DL>\n\nThis also leaves the possibilities open in the future for more\nsophisticated uses of these semantic renderings, which have much more\ninherent meaning than font styles like bold or italic.<P>\n\n<EM>(Unfortunately, the jury is still out to lunch on this one.  One\nargument against logical character styles is that it turns out to be a\nbottomless pit, attempting to define logical styles for every\npossibility.
