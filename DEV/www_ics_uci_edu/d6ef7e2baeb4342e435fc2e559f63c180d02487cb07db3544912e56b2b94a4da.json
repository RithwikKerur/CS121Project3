The author presents an O(log n)-competitive algorithm and\nshows that no algorithm can be O(1)-competitive.  Also, an\nO(1)-competitive algorithm is presented when the power of the adversary is\nreduced such that each demand point arrives in a random order.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
