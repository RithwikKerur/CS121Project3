The input is a set of jobs\nwith equal processing times, where each job is specified by its release\ntime and deadline. The goal is to determine a single-processor,\nnon-preemptive schedule that maximizes the number of completed\njobs. In the online version, each job arrives at its release time.\nWe give two online algorithms with competitive ratios below 2 and\nshow several lower bounds on the competitive ratios.\n<P>\nFirst, we give a barely random 5/3-competitive algorithm\nthat uses only one random bit. We also show a lower bound of 3/2 for\nbarely random algorithms that choose one of two deterministic algorithms.\n<P>\nSecond, we give a deterministic 3/2-competitive algorithm in the model\nthat allows restarts, and we show that in this model the ratio\n3/2 is optimal. For randomized algorithms with restarts we show a lower\nbound of 6/5.\n<P>\nThis is joint work with W.Jawor, J.Sgall, and T.Tichy.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
