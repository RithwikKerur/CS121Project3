You dont have to know everything regarding your subject but you should be the most passionate about it. Through your enthusiasm, others will be inspired and you will find creative solutions to any questions or confusions that arise. Try to rehearse your presentation before class as that will help ensure that you cover everything in the most convincing manner. Think of fun group exercises and different means to present the material to create a fun learning environment. Continue to believe in yourself and you will do great!&quot;        </li>\n        \n \n</ul>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
