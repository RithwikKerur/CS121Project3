technical or abstruse terms,\na collection of glosses.&nbsp;\nA <dfn>gloss</dfn> is a synonym or explanation\ninserted between the lines or in the margin to explain difficult words in a text\n&mdash; see the beautiful example to the right (Fig. 1) dating from 1241,\nin which you can clearly see glosses in the left margin,\nand also in the right margin, the center gutter, and in many of the\nspaces between lines.&nbsp;\nA glossary collects such glosses in a single place,\nrather than dispersed through a document.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA glossary for a particular problem or domain\nis a list of the special terms that are used there.&nbsp;\nA glossary is a partial dictionary\nin that it does not include words that are used in their ordinary senses,\nonly those that are either special words not used in ordinary life\nor that are used with a special meaning in this context.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nSee the <a href='votingGlossary.html'>voting glossary</a> for an example\nof a glossary in requirements engineering.&nbsp;\nThis glossary defines the words and phrases\nthat are used with special meaning\nin the domain of elections and voting.&nbsp;\nHyperlinks are used to take a reader from each use of a glossary term\nto the definition of that term,\nand the distinctive format of hyperlink text identifies each such use.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nA good glossary defines every word and phrase that is used with special meaning,\nand gives these definitions in terms of ordinary words\nand in terms of other glossary terms.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n\n<h1>Ontologies</h1>\n\n<p>\nAn

vehicles\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>\nAn ontology adds more information that is not present in a glossary.&nbsp;\nThis additional information provides for more informative problem descriptions.&nbsp;\nIt also makes it easier to check that the glossary is correct,\nby giving paths by which we can try out what we have so far.&nbsp;\nFor example,\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    since car is a sub-concept of vehicle,\n    every car must be a vehicle, and some vehicles are not cars.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    since wheels are parts of cars,\n    every car has wheels, and some wheels are parts of cars.\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    since cars have license numbers,\n    some license numbers belong to cars, and some vehicles have license numbers\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    since cars have at most one license number,\n    there is no car that has two license numbers (this seems close but questionable), and there could be a car that has no license number\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\nSome of this additional information can be effectively presented in a diagram\n(see Fig. 2).&nbsp;\nA key for ontology diagrams (as we will draw them in this class)\nis given in Fig. 3.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<div class='figure CR'>\n<img src='img/OntologyKey.png' alt='ontology key'/>\n<p> Fig. 3.&nbsp; Key to ontology diagrams</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>\nThere are several terms that seem just about interchangeable with \"ontology\"\nin requirements engineering:&nbsp;\n\"conceptual map\", \"conceptual graph\".&nbsp;\nOntologies show up in studies of databases\nand have recently become common as a coming underpinning of Web pages.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n\n<h2>Deciding what kind of relationship it is</h2>\n\n<p>\nOnce you have decided that two concepts <i>T</i> and <i>t</i> are related,\nyou need to decide what kind of relationship they have.&nbsp;\nOne way to decide is to consider the following questions, in sequence:&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    Is every <i>t</i> a <i>T</i>?&nbsp;\n    Then <i>t</i> is a sub-concept of <i>T</i>.&nbsp;\n    <p>\n    (It must not be possible for any <i>t</i> not to also be a <i>T</i>.)&nbsp;\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Does every <i>T</i> contain a <i>t</i> as a component part of it?&nbsp;\n    Then <i>T</i> and <i>t</i> have an instance-part relationship.&nbsp;\n    <p>\n    (<i>T</i> and <i>t</i> must be the same sort of concept:&nbsp;\n    both are physical objects, or both are mathematical concepts,\n    or ....)&nbsp;\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    (It must not be possible for a particular <i>t</i>\n    to be part of more than one <i>T</i> at the same time;\n    if it is possible, then probably a <i>t</i> is a property of a <i>T</i>\n    rather than a component part.)&nbsp;\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Is every <i>T</i> described by a <i>t</i> ?&nbsp;\n    Then <i>t</i> is a property of <i>T</i>.&nbsp;\n    <p>\n    (It must not be possible for any <i>T</i>\n    to not have a <i>t</i> that describes it.)&nbsp;\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Are <i>T</i> and <i>t</i> related, but not in any of the ways listed above?&nbsp;\n    Then <i>t</i> is just related to <i>T</i>.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\nBecause the hierarchical <i>sub-concept</i> and <i>instance-part</i> relationships\nare transitive,\nyou do not need to specify them\nacross more than one level of hierarchy;\nfor example, if \"Toyota Prius\" is a sub-concept of \"Toyota\",\nand \"Toyota\" is a sub-concept of \"car\",\nyou need not also say that \"Toyota Prius\" is a sub-concept of \"car\",\nbecause it is already implied.\nSimilarly, if \"tire\" is a part of \"wheel\",\nand \"wheel\" is a part of \"car\",\nyou need not say that \"tire\" is a part of \"car\"\nbecause this is also already implied.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRelations are inherited down the sub-concept hierarchy,\nand these do not need to be explicitly stated either.&nbsp;\nFor example, \"car\" is related to \"model-year\", so\nyou need not say that \"Toyota Prius\" is related to \"model-year\"\nbecause this is already implied.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<span class='scit'>Example</span>:&nbsp;\ncar, Toyota Prius, wheel, model year, driver, goal.&nbsp;\nWhat kinds of relationships do these have?&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    Every Toyota Prius is a car;\n    there are no Toyota Priuses that are not cars.&nbsp;\n    Therefore\n    \"Toyota Prius\" is a sub-concept of \"car\".&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    It is not true that every wheel is a car, or vice-versa,\n    so \"wheel\" and \"car\" do not have a sub-concept relationship.&nbsp;\n    However, every car has wheels as some of its component parts,\n    and both cars and wheels are physical objects,\n    and it is not possible for a wheel to be part of\n    more than one car at the same time.&nbsp;\n    Therefore\n    \"car\" and \"wheel\" have an instance-part relationship,\n    with \"wheel\" being a part of \"car\".&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    It is not true that every model year is a car, or vice-versa,\n    so \"model-year\" and \"car\" do not have a sub-concept relationship.&nbsp;\n    Nor does every car have a model year as one of its component parts,\n    because \"car\" and \"model year\" are very different kinds of concepts.&nbsp;\n    But every car is described by a model year,\n    so \"model year\" is a property of \"car\".&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    It is not true that every driver is a car, or vice-versa,\n    so \"driver\" and \"car\" do not have a sub-concept relationship.&nbsp;\n    Nor does every car have a driver as one of its component parts,\n    or vice-versa,\n    so \"driver\" and \"car\" do not have an instance-part relationship.&nbsp;\n    Nor is every car is described by specifying its driver,\n    or vice versa, at least not in general\n    (a particular driver may drive many cars, although not at the same time),\n    so neither \"driver\" nor \"car\" is a property of the other.&nbsp;\n    However, there is a relationship between a driver and a car,\n    although it is none of the above kinds.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    \"Car\" and \"goal\" do not appear to have any relationship.&nbsp;\n    It's not necessary to state this specifically\n    (unless a reader might be confused and assume some relationship exists),\n    as most concepts are assumed to be unrelated\n    unless some relationship is stated.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Deciding what cardinality or function is appropriate, if any, for a relationship</h2>\n\n<p>\nSub-concept relationships <b>never</b> have cardinalities or functions;\nthey make no sense for this kind of relationship.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn instance-part relationship or a property relationship\nhas an <b>implicit</b> cardinality (at one end).&nbsp;\nIf a <i>t</i> is a part of a <i>T</i>,\nthen there is necessarily at most one <i>T</i> for every <i>t</i> already,\nand this should not be also specified as a cardinality.&nbsp;\nIf a <i>t</i> is a property of a <i>T</i>,\nthen there are ordinarily many <i>T</i>s for every <i>t</i> already,\nand this should not be also specified as a cardinality.&nbsp;\nIf the cardinality of the instances for a particular property is important,\nthe relationship should probably not be expressed as a property.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAn instance-part relationship\nhas an <b>implicit</b> function (in one direction).&nbsp;\nIt is always possible to figure out which <i>T</i> goes with a specific <i>t</i>\nthat is part of it\n(it's the one that the <i>t</i> is part of)\nand this should not be also specified as a function.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nAlthough it makes no sense to specify a function that restricts an\ninstance-part or property relationship,\nit is possible to have one cardinality\nat the part end of an instance-part relationship,\nor at the property end of a property relationship.&nbsp;\nA <i>T</i> may consist of <i>n</i> <i>t</i>s, for example,\nor be characterized by <i>n</i> values of property <i>p</i>.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Other relationships\" can have cardinalities at either or both ends,\nand can be restricted by functions in either direction.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<span class='scit'>Example</span>:&nbsp;\ncar, Toyota Prius, wheel, model year, driver, goal.&nbsp;\nWhat kinds of cardinalities and functions do these have?&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    \"Toyota Prius\" is a sub-concept of \"car\".&nbsp;\n    Sub-concept relationships do not have cardinalities or functions.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    \"Car\" and \"wheel\" have an instance-part relationship,\n    with \"wheel\" being a part of \"car\".&nbsp;\n    In an instance-part relationship,\n    the cardinality of the whole instance is never stated (it is implied to be 1)\n    nor is the function from a part to a whole stated.&nbsp;\n    It is possible to give a cardinality for the number of parts, however.&nbsp;\n    In this case, we would say that each car has 4 wheels.&nbsp;\n    We might also give functions to determine the four wheels for a particular car,\n    calling them \"right-front\", \"left-front\", etc.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    \"Model year\" is a property of \"car\",\n    and \"car\" and \"model-year\" have an instance-property relationship\n    (an instance of a car has a model year as a property).&nbsp;\n    The cardinality of the instance is never or rarely stated\n    (it is implied to be *).&nbsp;\n    Each car has exactly one model year, however, and this should be stated.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    \"Driver\" and \"car\" have a relationship\n    that is none of the above kinds.&nbsp;\n    It would be possible to specify cardinalities\n    and/or functions if these could be determined.&nbsp;\n    A driver \"drives\" a car, so it would probably make sense\n    to specify this as a function\n    (each driver can drive at most one car at a time)\n    by labelling the line between the concepts;\n    the cardinalities might be 0..1 drivers drive 0..1 cars\n    (each driver drives either 0 or 1 car at a time,\n    and each car is driven by either 0 or 1 driver at a time).&nbsp;\n    An alternative relationship might be \"can drive\";\n    for this relationship, the cardinalities might be * drivers can drive * cars\n    (a driver can drive any of some unknown but potentially large number of cars,\n    and vice versa).&nbsp;\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    \"Car\" and \"goal\" have no relationship,\n    so it makes no sense to talk about cardinalities and functions for these.&nbsp;\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<h2>Testing the correctness of an ontology</h2>\n\n<p>\nIn general, one can test the correctness of an ontology by asking these questions:&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<ol class='oi'>\n  <li><b>Glossary</b>.&nbsp;\n    For every

should) ask about parts of an ontology,\neven if you don't know what the concepts mean\n(as in the \"Frooble\" example diagram in Fig. 4).&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li> Questions about concepts (\"an A\")\n    <ol>\n      <li> What can an A do (or have, or be related to) that a non-A can't?\n      </li>\n      <li> What can't an A do that a non-A can?\n      </li>\n      <li> What can only some A's do?\n      </li>\n      <li> Can a non-A later become an A?&nbsp; Can an A later not be an A?\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li> Questions about properties (\"A is <i>P</i>\")\n    <ol>\n      <li> If A is <i>P</i> right now, does that mean A is always <i>P</i>?\n      </li>\n      <li> What can A do or not do if it is <i>P</i>?\n      </li>\n      <li> What can A do or not do if it is not <i>P</i>?\n      </li>\n      <li> What other relationships can A have if it is <i>P</i>,\n        that it can't have if it is not <i>P</i>?\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li> Questions about sub-concept hierarchy (\"An A is a B\")\n    <ol>\n      <li> Can an A do everything a B can?&nbsp; (should be \"yes\")\n      </li>\n      <li> Are there Bs that are not As?&nbsp; (should be \"yes\")\n      </li>\n      <li> If an A is a B now, can it later still be an A but not be a B?&nbsp;\n        (should be \"no\")\n      </li>\n      <li> If an A changes later so it is no longer an A,\n          is it still necessarily a B anyway?\n        (could be either \"yes\" or \"no\")\n      </li>\n      <li> Can an A change later so it is not an A?&nbsp;\n          (can be either \"yes\" or \"no\")\n        <i>(unlike UML class diagrams)</i>\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li> Questions about relationships and functions (\"A is <i>R</i> with B\")\n    <ol>\n      <li> Is every A <i>R</i> with some B?\n      </li>\n      <li> How many Bs is A <i>R</i> with?\n      </li>\n      <li> Is A always <i>R</i> with B?\n      </li>\n      <li> Is A necessarily <i>R</i> with itself?\n      </li>\n      <li> If A is <i>R</i> with B, does that mean B is <i>R</i> with A?\n      </li>\n      <li> If A is <i>R</i> with B, and B is <i>R</i> with C, is A <i>R</i> with C?\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\nYou can ask these questions about any ontology,\neven if you don't know what the concepts in the ontology mean.&nbsp;\nThe answers help test you understanding of the relations among the concepts\n</p>\n\n\n<!--xhtml -n -->\n</div>\n\n</div><!-- #TBg -->\n\n<div id='TFooter'>\n<div class='W3C'>\n  <a href='http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer'><img
