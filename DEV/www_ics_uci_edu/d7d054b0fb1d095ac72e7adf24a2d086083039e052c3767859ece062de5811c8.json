This variable is the number of pieces needed in a row to win. to update from an older version of the C++ shell, simply add \r\nint k \r\nas a public variable in the AIShell.h file. This has been done in the included source files and can be seen on line 27 of the included AIShell.h file. \r\nAlso, verify that the int deadline variable has also been added as a public variable. This variable is also in the included AIShell.h file. \r\nIn the end, your AIShell.h file should include at least all the same variables and functions that the included AIShell.h file includes.\r\nAdditionally, the old ConnectK.cpp file should be replaced by the included ConnectK.cpp file. \r\nLastly, the new ConnectKShell.jar should be used to run the game.", "encoding": "ascii"}
