Seredkin\n</h2>\n<p>\nAbstract: This paper presents the Priority R-tree, or PR-tree, which is the\nfirst R-tree variant that always answers a window query using\nO((N/B)<sup>1-1/d</sup>+T/B) I/Os, where N is the number of d-dimensional\n(hyper-) rectangles stored in the R-tree, B is the disk block size, and T\nis the output size. This is provably asymptotically optimal and\nsignificantly better than other R-tree variants, where a query may visit\nall N/B leaves in the tree even when T=0.\n<p>\n(This paper is from the 2004 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on\nManagement of Data.)\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
