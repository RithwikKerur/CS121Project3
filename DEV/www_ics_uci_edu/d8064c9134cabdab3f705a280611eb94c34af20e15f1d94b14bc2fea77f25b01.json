(i.e., the size differs by at most a constant factor, and distance between the two regions is a constant times that size). We show that it is possible to create a linear size data structure that allows for insertions, deletions, and queries in logarithmic time, and allows for local updates in sub-logarithmic time on a pointer machine.\n\n\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ISO-8859-1"}
