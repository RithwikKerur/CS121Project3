Thompson, Debra J. Richardson, and Lori A. Clarke in\n<i>Proceeding of the 1993 International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis</i>,\npages 182-192, Cambridge, MA, June 1993.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nRELAY is a model of how a fault causes a failure on execution of some test \ndatum. This process begins with introduction of an original state potential \nfailure at a fault location and continues as the potential failure(s) \ntransfers to output. Here we describe the second stage of this process,\ntransfer of an incorrect intermediate state from a faulty statement to \noutput. \n\nTransfer occurs along information flow chains, where each link in the \nchain involves data dependence transfer and/or control dependence transfer. \nRELAY models concurrent transfer along multiple information flow chains \nwith transfer sets, which identify possible interaction between potential \nfailures, and with transfer routes, which identify actual interactions. \nTransfer sets, transfer routes, and control dependence transfer are \nunique to the RELAY model. \n\nThe model demonstrates that the process of potential failure transfer \nis extremely complex and full analysis of real programs may not be \npractical. Nonetheless, RELAY provides insight into testing and fault \ndetection and suggests an approach to fault-based testing and analysis \nthat may be warranted for critical systems software. \n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Fri Nov 11 14:39:25 1994\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
