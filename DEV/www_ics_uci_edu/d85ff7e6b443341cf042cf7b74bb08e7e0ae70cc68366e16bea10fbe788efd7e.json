Esther Langsam married my\r\ngreat grandfather Samual Jacobs. Esther was born March 16, 1870 in Austria. Her\r\nfather's name\r\n(from death cert) is Schiea Langsam, and mother is Riva Chaia (I hope I've\r\nspelled them right). Esther is buried in Beth David Cemetery in Elmont, NY (Long\r\nIsland). She\r\nis the only Langsam in my tree as she married into the Jacobs family. You can\r\nsee my family tree at: http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/3293/ .\r\n\r\nAt the time of her death, she lived at 1002 Foster Ave, Brooklyn, NY. Prior to\r\nthat at 1283 Ocean Ave., Brooklyn, NY. That's all I have. Maybe it will help.\r\nLet me know.\r\n\r\nAllison\r\n\r\n\r\nThe website at:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/3293/austria.htm\">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Hills/3293/austria.htm</a>\r\nhas the following info:\r\n</pre>\r\n<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Descendants of Samual Jacobs<BR>\r\nand Esther (Langsam) Jacobs</H1>\r\n\r\n<PRE><FONT SIZE=+1>\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n<B>1.

Nice to find\r\nsomeone out there who is related some how! How old are you? I'll be 48\r\nin June. The last place I lived in Brooklyn was on E. 29th St. between\r\nKings Highway and Ave. P. I went to James Madison HS. My dad is Stanton\r\nWhite (Rose's son); don't know if you know the name. Below I've tried to\r\nanswer as good as possible your questions. Hope it helps you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, the Esther listed is wife of Samuel, with daughter-in-law Ruby.\r\n*Ruby was married to Irving. Irving is buried in Beth David Cemetery in\r\nElmont, NY (Long Island). There is a Jacobs/White plot (big section near\r\nthe front entrance). Esther's daughter Rose (Jacobs) White (my\r\ngrandmother) is buried there (on the White side). Esther & Samual are\r\nburied there (on the Jacobs side), along with their son Abe, his wife\r\nMolly, and their son Mitchell (who died young); Esther and Samual's\r\ndaugther Leah (Jacobs) and her husband Simon Lieberman are also buried\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think they made a mistake although it won't be the first time I saw a\r\ndeath certificate with the wrong data.\r\n*Well, his name could have been changed at Ellis Island, or translated\r\nto Issac.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are contacting this uncle, the other important question to ask is\r\nWHAT OTHER LANGSAM'S DO YOU KNOW? Any of Esther's sibling's names or\r\ntheir children? Then we can really put this tree where it belongs.\r\n*Do you know any of Esther's siblings?\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, from where in Europe were they?\r\n*The 1920 census says Samual and Esther came from Austria. Funny, it\r\nalso says they spoke Polish!\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have their marriage record? Were they married in the USA? Her\r\ndeath record implies she came here when she was 24. Did she already have\r\nkids?\r\n*I don't have a marriage record, but they were married in Austria (or\r\nwherever). My Grandmother Rose was born in Austria along with her sister\r\nGussie. The rest of the four children were born in the US. According to\r\nthe 1920 census, they came to the US in 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, it says she was naturalized. Do you have the  records pertaining\r\nto that? If not, would you like me to try and get that for you from the\r\nNARA here or Brooklyn Supreme Court? If so, do you know where they lived\r\nbefore 1002 Foster Ave (which is right near me).\r\n*Also according to the 1920 census, it says they (Samual, Esther, and\r\nGussie) were naturalized in 1905. Women were naturalized when the\r\nhusband/father was. By 1920, Rose (my grandmother) was married and had\r\ntwo children (my uncle and my dad), and living in Wisconsin. Also\r\naccording to the 1920 census, their address was 670 (?) Rockaway Ave,\r\nKings County. I do not have the naturalization papers. Haven't been able\r\nto find them yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would send a scanned copy of the census, but it is very dark and hard\r\nto read. I am attaching copys of photos I took at the cemetery; have\r\nothers, will send tomorrow. Happy researching... will be in touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nAllison\r\n\r\n<a href=\"../pic/psamjcbs.jpg\"><img src=\"../pic/psamjcbs.jpg\" width=\"50\" height=\"22\" alt=\"Samuel Jacobs\" border=\"0\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"../pic/pestrjcb.jpg\"><img src=\"../pic/pestrjcb.jpg\" width=\"30\" height=\"26\" alt=\"Esther Jacobs nee Langsam\" border=\"0\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"../pic/pirvjcbs.jpg\"><img src=\"../pic/pirvjcbs.jpg\" width=\"30\" height=\"21\" alt=\"Irving Jacobs\" border=\"0\"></a>\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: Allgolf111@aol.com \r\nDate: Wed, 2 Feb 2000 10:16:08 EST \r\nSubject: Esther Jacobs branch \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\nX-Mailer: AOL 5.0 for Windows sub 45 \r\n\r\n\r\nHi Moishe,\r\nAlly White contacted me about the family tree.

The issue at hand was how Esther Jacobs (of Ruby and Allison\r\nWhite fame) fits in. Before I left for Israel, I was playing around with\r\nvarious Jewish sites and found cemetery records for Beth David in Queens.\r\n\r\nRuby Jacobs thought that Esther was the daughter of Isaac and Gittel but\r\nshe was the daughter of Abraham Langsam. Esther did marry Samuel Jacobs and\r\nthey had a bunch of children as your correspondence with Allison White\r\nindicated. I have no quarrel with the tree as she provided it except that\r\nEsther was a daughter of Abraham. Esther was born 3/1/1870 which would\r\nplace Abraham with a birthdate at least 20 years before.\r\n\r\nEither the stone and cemetery records are incorrect and she really was a\r\ndaughter to Isaac and Gittel in H9 or she belongs elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSuzan \r\n____________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nTo: \"Suzan & Ron Wynne\" <srwynne@erols.com>\r\nSent: Monday, July 19, 2004 10:13 AM\r\nSubject: Re: H9 Additions\r\n \r\n Hi,\r\n\r\n Welcome back!!! I missed you; I have been hard at work\r\n trying to coallate all my various notes, emails and\r\n additins to FTM into a document I can send you, similar to\r\n the one you sent to me on the H sections. I think this will\r\n stil take me some time, so please be patient.\r\n\r\n Regarding H9, please clarify what you mean by \"Ruby Jacobs\r\n thought that Esther was the daughter of Isaac and Gittel\r\n but\r\n she was the daughter of Abraham Langsam\"\r\n\r\n Which ABRAHAM LANGSAM do you mean???\r\n\r\n I have my own pet theory - Esther Jacobs was a sister to\r\n Isaac, not a daughter. Furthermore, I think that H9 and H8\r\n connect via the Schia reference on Esther's death\r\n certifiacte (see it at:\r\n http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/pic/pcertejc.jpg)\r\n\r\n Please share your thoughts and comments!\r\n\r\n :)\r\n Moishe\r\n___________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: \"Suzan & Ron Wynne\" <srwynne@erols.com> \r\nSubject: Re: H9 Additions \r\nDate: Mon, 19 Jul 2004 11:54:31 -0400 \r\nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\nNow that IS interesting. The cemetery record has her father as Abraham. If\r\nthe death record is correct, and I have no reason to suspect that it is not,\r\nthen the task is to figure out who Schaya and Riva Chaia are. Yours is an\r\ninteresting theory. For now, as I have counseled before, I think she ought\r\nto be treated separately. We may never be able to solve this little\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nSuzan\r\n___________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: Sw1031@aol.com \r\nSubject: addition to familytree \r\nDate: Wed, 8 Dec 2004 02:29:11 EST \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\nHi Moishe,\r\n \r\nI am writing to update my family.
