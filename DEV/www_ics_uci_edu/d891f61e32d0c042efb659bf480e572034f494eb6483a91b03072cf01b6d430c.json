More formally, a lattice can be defined as a discrete\nsubgroup of a finite-dimensional vector space (the subgroup is\noften required not to lie within any subspace of the vector space, which can\nbe expressed formally by saying that the quotient of the space by the\nlattice is compact).\n<P>\nThe simplest and most\ncommonly-studied example of\na lattice (the \"integer grid\") is formed by the points all Cartesian\ncoordinates of which are integers.\nOther types of lattices arise in crystallography and in\n<A HREF=\"spherepack.html\">sphere packing</A>, where they are\nused to describe the locations of atoms or spheres.\nLattices are also particularly important in the theory of periodic <A\nHREF=\"tiling.html\">tilings</A>, since they describe the set of\ntranslational symmetries of a tiling.\n<P>\n<UL>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.research.att.com/~njas/lattices/\">Catalogue of lattices</A>, N.

Dan Asimov asks how large a triangle will fit into a\nsquare torus; equivalently, the densest packing of equilateral triangles\nin the pattern of a square lattice.\nThere is only one parameter to optimize, the angle of the triangle to\nthe lattice vectors; <A HREF=\"tripack.html\">my answer</A>\nis that the densest packing occurs when\nthis angle is 15 or 45 degrees, <A HREF=\"tripack.ps\">shown below</A>.\n(If the lattice doesn't have to be square, it is possible to get density\n2/3; apparently this was long known, e.g. see F&aacute;ry,\nBull. Soc. Math. France 78 (1950) 152.)\n\n<P>Asimov also asks for the smallest triangle that will always cover at least\none point of the integer lattice, or equivalently a triangle\nsuch that no matter at what angle you place copies of it on an integer lattice,\nthey always cover the plane; my guess is that the worst angle is parallel\nand 30 degrees to the lattice, giving a triangle with 2-unit sides\nand contradicting an earlier answer to Asimov's question.\n\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER><IMG src=\"tripack.gif\" WIDTH=273 HEIGHT=273></DIV><P>\n<P>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.neutreeko.net/grid.htm\">Grid subgraphs</a>.\nJan Kristian Haugland looks for sets of lattice points that induce\ngraphs with high degree but no short cycles.\n<p>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.math.uch.gr/~kolount/publ.html\">Mike Kolountzakis' publications</A> include several recent papers on lattice tiling.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"lattice-pentagon.html\">Lattice pentagons</A>.\nThe vertices of a regular pentagon are not the subset of any lattice.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/~achim/no3in/readme.html\">The\nno-three-in-line problem</A>.\nHow many points can be placed in an <I>n</I>*<I>n</I> grid with no three\non a common line?

(In fact, according\nto Senechal's <I>Quasicrystals and Geometry</I>, although the set\nof Voronoi adjacencies of any lattice generates the lattice, it's not\nknown whether this set always contains a basis.)\n<P>\n</UL>\n\n<HR><P>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">Send email</A> if you\nknow of an appropriate page not listed here.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<BR>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</A>\nfrom a common source file.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
