This operating system is \ndesigned to be used with a specific PC microprocessor <img src \n=\"http://web.jf.intel.com:80/procs/penticn.gif\">, the \"brain\" of the \ncomputer which controls the operation of a computer by coordinating the \ninteraction between the computer's microprocessor, memory, and \nperipherals (i.e. attatched devices such as monitors, disk drives, and \nprinters.)  In a sense, the PC operating system functions as the \"central \nnervous system\" of the computer.  The computer cannot function without \nit.  Most of the computers in the world today utilize the <a href= \n\"http://www.intel.com/index.html\"><img src \n=\"http://www.intel.com/pix/home.gif\"></a> designed x86 \nclass of \nmicroprocessors.  These x86 microprocessors do not only include Intel \nmanufactured microprocessors (286, 386, 486, and Pentium) but also \ninclude microprocessors manufactured by other firms that are based on a \nsimilar architecture.  MS-DOS is the mainstream operating system used for \nthese Intel and Intel-based microprocessors.  In addition to the \noperating system, applications are required for the computer to perform \nany useful task.  Applications are software programs that communicate \nwith the operating system to allow the user to perform a variety of \nfunctions.  Application programs include word processors, spreadsheets, \nand database programs.  Each application is written for a particular \noperating system and incorporates the codes that allow the application to \nfunction within the operating system environment.  Microsoft manufactures \nand markets a number of its own very successful applications. <br>\n<br>\nIn 1985 Microsoft introduced a graphical user interface operating system \ncalled Windows.   Windows allows the user to give commands to the \noperating system by pointing and clicking on a device called a \"mouse\" \neliminating the need for the user to memorize complex commands.  In \naddition to simplifying the instruction process.  Windows also allows the \nuser to run more than one application at one time.  To date, Microsoft \nestimates that over 50 million computers use Windows. <hr>\n<br>\nThe marketing of the MS_DOS and Windows operating systems is one \nprimarily through original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\").  OEMs \nmanufacture PC's and sells them to consumers and businesses either \ndirectly or through resellers.  Some of the large OEMs would be <a href \n=\"http://www.ibm.com/\">  IBM </a>, <a \nhref =\"//www.compaq.com/\"> Compaq </a>, and <a href \n=\"http://www.dell.com/\"> Dell </a>, all of which have agreements with \nMicrosoft.  The MS-DOS operating system is generally distributed only \nto OEMs, with upgrades being offered to consumers.  Microsoft sold 80 \npercent of its Windows units through OEMs.\n<h2>The Complaint:</h2></a>\nThe <a href =\"http://gopher.usdoj.gov/atr/complnt.html\">complaint</a> from \nthe Antitrust division of the Department of Justice \nlisted certain points that concerned them as to Microsoft's domination of \nthe market for operating systems.  First of all, the Department of \nJustice defined the relavant market and the monopoly power that Microsoft \nheld.  Second, the Department of Justice listed the barriers to entry by \nnew firms.  Third, the Dapartment of Justice stated the reasons why.  \nFinally, the Department of Justice listed the anticompetitive effects of \nMicrosoft's behavior. <br>\n<br>\nThe relavant market was defined as the market for personal computer \noperating systems using the x86 class of microprocessors with the \nrelavant geographic market being the world.  It is improtant to note that \noperating systems written for other microprocessors will not work on \nmachines with the x86 class microprocessor, therefore OEMs who sell and \ncustomers who buy x86 machines cannot use other operating systems.  Since \nat least the mid-1980's, Microsoft has had a monopoly power in the \nrelavant market due to their ability to maintain an extremely high market \nshare in excess of 70 percent with MS-DOS installed on over 120 million \nPCs and Windows installed on over 50 million PCs worldwide.<br>\n<br>\nThe next concern of the Department of Justice was the barriers to entry \nthat faced new firms.  The first barrier to entry being the considrable \ntime and expense required to develop, test, and market a new operating \nsystem.  Other barriers that face software developers are: 1) the absence \nof a variety of high quality applications that will run on a new \noperating system and the difficulty in convincing independant software \nvendors (\"ISVs\") to develop those applications. 2) The lack of a sizable \ninstalled base of users, and 3) The difficulty in convincing OEMs to \noffer and promote a non-Microsoft PC operating system, particularly one \nwith a small user base and relatively few applications availible to run \nin it.  Because the value of an operating system to the consumer lies on \nthe availibility of a variety of high quality applications that run on \nthe system, and the number of users who are able to use and share \ninformation without additional training, these barriers to entry magnify \nand reinforce each other.  Due to this reasoning, software manufacturers \ntend to develop applications for operating systems with a large \ninstalled user base, and consumers tend to purchase operating systems \nwith a large availibility of applications.<br>\n<br>\nThe third concern of the Department of Justice was the anticometitive \nnature of Microsoft's marketing agreements.  The \"per processor\" licenses \nthat Microsoft was issuing requires that OEMs pay a royalty for each \ncomputer the OEM sells containing a particular processor whether or not \nthe OEM has installed a Microsoft operating system in that computer or \nnot.  Because the profit margins in the computer industry are currently \nvery thin, the OEM has the incentive to enter into these agreements with \nthe reasoning being the ability to purchase the operating system at the \nlowest possible cost.  OEMs believe that they must install MS-DOS and \nWindows in their computers because of Microsoft's monopoly position in \nthe marketplace.  Because the \"per processor\" contract penalizes the OEMs \nfor inststalling a non-Microsoft operating system.  OEMs bound by the \n\"per processor contract\" are deterred from using sny competitive \nalternatives nto the Microsoft operating systems.  Another feature of the \nmarketing agreements between Microsoft and the OEMs is the long term \nnature of these agreements.  Microsoft requires minimum commitments and \ncredits unused balances to future contracts, which effectively lengthens \nthe contract, even though the frequent contract duration of three years \nor more exceeds the product life cycle of most operating system \nproducts.  The credit to future contracts make the OEM wary of installing \na non-Microsoft operating system.  Microsoft also often extends the term \nof the OEM licenses to beyond five years. <br>\n<br>\nBy blocking acess to OEMs, Microsoft has taken away from competitors a \ncritical point of entry.  The majority of PCs are sold through the large \nOEMs, all of which have \"per processor\" agreements with Microsoft.  Even \nif a competing operating system were to license itself to a smaller OEM \nthat it not covered by Microsoft's \"per processor\" agreement, it would \nnot be able to achieve any commercial success.  Thus a competing \noperating system must have access to large OEMs.<br>\n<br>\nAnother type of agreement that Microsoft enters into are agreements with \nIndependant Software Vendors (\"ISVs\").  ISVs develop applications and \nMicrosoft has sought to restrict the ability of important ISVs to develop \napplications for competing operating systems by pursuing non-disclosure \nagreements.  The terms of these non-disclosure agreements prevent major \nISV developers from working with other operating system developers and \ncompeting technologies for long periods of time.  ISVs enter into these \nagreements because they need access to Microsoft's beta tests with new \nproducts especially with the upcoming version of Windows, code named \n<a \nhref \n=\"http://www.microsoft.com/pages/peropsys/win_news/chicago/wwwhtml/home/w95.htm><img \nsrc \n=\"http://www.microsoft.com/pages/peropsys/win_news/chicago/ms-www/smchic.gif\">Chicago</a>, \nthat will be released sometime in 1995.  The beta tests are \nconducted before the commercial release of the produuct so the ISVs can \nobtain critical information about the interfaces in the operating system \nthat connect with applicartions - information which is necessary to write \napplications for that operating system.  It is important for Microsoft to \nconduct these \"beta tests\" not only for ISVs but for themselves as well.  \nFor Microsoft, the \"beta tests\" provide them with important feedback \nabout the operating system.  Also, the sucess of the operating system \ndepends on the availibility of applications and providing the ISVs with \nthe \"beta tests\" insures that there can be a large availibility.<br>\n<br>\nFinally, the Department of Justice listed the effects of Microsoft's \nanticompetitive behavior.  According to the Department of Justice, \nMicrosoft engaged in unlawful acts and practices that harmed competition, \nconsumers, and innovation.  First of all, Microsoft contracts have \nexcluded competitors on a basis other than the merits of their product.  \nSecond, Microsoft impedes the ability of rival operating systems to \ncompete in the market by making it more difficult for competitors to \nconvince OEMs to install their operating systems on their computers and \nto convince consumers that the system is a possible alternative to \nMS-DOS and Windows.  Third, the exclusionary license policy that \nMicrosoft uses deprives competing operating systems of sales they might \nhave been able to secure had they been able to develop a sufficient \ninstallation base through the OEM channel.<br>\n<br>\nThe damage to competition by Microsoft's actions also harms consumers.  \nConsumers that want a choice of operating systems may be forced to pay \nmore since the OEM will have to pay a double royalty, one to Microsoft \nunder the 'per processor' agreement and one to the competing operating \nsystems manufacturer.  Thus Microsoft has limited the choices that \nconsumers have with operating systems and applications.<br>\n<h2>The Economics:</h2><br>\nThe reason why Microsoft can possibly gain monopoly power despite \nthe availibility of competing products is because of the existence of \n<a href \n=\"http://www.rand.org/misc/rje/abstracts/abstracts/./1994/Autumn_1994._pp._382_401.html\">network \nexternalities. </a>  Network \nexternalities can be defined as the \nbenefits a product has as it emerges as a standard due to having a large \nuser base.  In other words, the value of a particular product becomes \nhigher as more users adopt products with the same technology.  The fast \npace of technological change in computers and computer software has made \nconsumers of one technology dependent on other technologies.  In the PC \noperating systems market, the success of a particular product is \ndependent on the complementary products availible that are compatible \nwith that particular operating system.  Incompatibility creates a problem \nfor consumers and competitors if network externalities exist by harming \nthe ability of the user of a certain PC operating system to \"swap\" \ninformation with the user of the mainstream PC operating system as a well \nas preventing the user of the non-mainstream operating system from \naccessing the complementary applications and other resources of the \nmainstream PC operating system.<br>\n<br>\nInitial consumer demand hinges on the decision of the consumer to buy or \nnot to buy the operating system.  However, the consumer usually would not \nmake his choice when he purchases the computer.  The choice of the \nconsumer will have an effect on purchases in future generations since the \nconsumer will most likely demand a future improved unit later.  Thus, the \n'per processor' agreements with the major OEMs changes the popularity of \nMicrosoft's MS-DOS and Windows operating system into a de facto standard \nby giving the OEM every incentive to install a Microsoft operating system \nand not to install the operating system of its competitors since the OEM \nmust pay Microsoft regardless of whether or not it installed Microsoft's \noperating system on a computer.  This leads to the consumer automatically \nhaving a Microsoft operating system when they purchase the computer, \nthereby causing them to be more likely to upgrade their Microsoft product \nin future generations, whereas prices aside, the success of a PC \noperating system would otherwise depend on the technical capabilities of \nthe product and whether or not future generations adopt the same PC \noperating system as well as the network effect.<br>\n<br>\nThough standardization by network effects benefits the consumer by \nsetting technological standards for the consumer, it also hurts the \nconsumer by eventually limiting their choices despite development of \nsuperior non-standardized products.  Furthermore, standardization created \nby Microsoft's agreements with the OEMs has a negative effect on \ncompetition in general.  Through it's agreements, Microsoft capitalized on \na temporary popularity of its products and created a standard by using \nevery method possible to deny their competitors the same sales \noutlets.<br>\n<br>\n<h2>The Response:</h2>\nThough the complaint filed against Microsoft is well supported by the \narguments made by the Department of Justice and by economic theories, \ncertain legal conditions must be met in order to warant actions against \nMicrosoft.  The Department of Justice asserts that Microsoft's marketing \nagreements violate Section 2 of the Sherman Act.  Microsoft's response to \nthese claims has been to deny any wrongdoing and to claim insufficient \ngrounds for an antitrust action.  Even many individuals outside of \nMicrosoft that are familiar with the Personal Computer industry fail to \nsee the basis for any action against Microsoft.<br>\n<br>\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act \"prohibits monopolists from acquiring or \nmaintaining power by blatantly illegal or uncompetitive acts.\"  This \nmeans that the market power a company develops must be the result of \nnatural growth and that power cannot be used improperly to restrain \ncompetition.  In order for a company to be seenn as using its market \npower improperly, the Department of Justice must show that Microsoft has \nthe willful intent to monopolize and the power to do so.  The problem \nwith this is that there is no clear definition of monopoly power in \nMicrosoft's case because the market structure has been blurred by the \nDepartment of Justice's establishment of numerous software segments (i.e. \noperating systems, applications, etc.)  Furthermore  any monopoly power \nthat Microsoft might have could be argued as being the result of the \ninsight of Bill Gates and the ability of his company to produce \ntechnologically superior products.  The lack of clarity in PC software \nmarket share also weakens the Department of Justice ability to show \nintent through leveraging, because it would require that the Department \nof Justice have strong evidence of high market share. <br>\n<br>\nMicrosoft has complained that this action by the Department of Justice is \naimed at taking away the success of an innovative company.  Cponcerning \nthe \"per processor\" agreements with the OEMs, executives at Microsoft \nhave insisted that these are optional bulk discounts and that Microsoft \ndoes not force OEMs to enter into these agreements.  Also Microsoft \nexecutives point out that consumers have equal access to competing \nproducts on the market as they do with Microsoft products.<br>\n<br>\n<h2> The Final Settlement </h2><br>\n On August 19, 1994, the Department of Justice and the Microsoft \nCorporation submitted a <a href \n=\"http://gopher.usdoj.gov/atr/microcis.html\"> \nsettlement agreement </a>to Federal Judge Stanley \nSporkin for approval.  In the settlement agreement, the Microsoft \nCorporation agreed to change the 'per processor' agreements in to 'per \nsystem' agreements and reduce the length of its contracts to terms of one \nyear.  Finally, the company agreed to limit the use of non-disclosure \nagreements for developers of its operating system products and permit \ncomputer manufacturers to renegotiate contract terms if they pleased.<br>\n<br>\n<h2> Why He Said No.. </h2><br>\nFederal Judge Stanley Sporkin refused to approve the settlement agreement \nbetween the Department of Justice and the Microsoft Corporation for a \nnumber of reasons.  First, Judge Sporkin found that the Department of \nJustice did not provide the court with enough information for it to make \na proper public interest determination.  Second, he found the scope of \nthe settlement to be too narrow.  Third, he found that both the \nDepartment of Justice and the Microsoft Corporation have been unwilling \nto adequately address certain anticompetitive practices, and finally he \nfound the settlement to be ineffective as a remedy for the complaint in \nthat the mechanisms incorporated in the settlement for enforcement and \ncompliance were unsatisfactory.<br>\n<br>   \n <!--------===========CUT===HERE=========-------------->\nSubmitted March 02, 1995\nfor <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
