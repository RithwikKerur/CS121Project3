Until now, UCI has informed people\rof these events using a haphazard collection of e-mails, web pages,\rflyers, and word of mouth. However, as the campus grows, it becomes\rincreasingly more difficult to inform people of the many different\rUCI events. UCI now wishes to supplement this process by creating a\runiversity calendar system, called UniCal, to inform interested parties\rof campus events.</p>\r\r<p>Because UCI is a research oriented institution, it does not want to\rburden its professors or students with production oriented software\rengineering projects. Consequently, it has hired Retro Software\rInc. to develop this requirements specification for UniCal, as well\ras its subsequent design and implementation. The information in this\rrequirements specification is based on interviews conducted with the\rrelevant parties at UCI, by the requirements engineers at Retro Software\rInc. All information in this document was determined to be accurate at\rthe time of this writing.</p>\r\r<p>This document contains the detailed requirements specification for\rUniCal that Retro Software Inc. is developing for UCI. The document should\rserve as the official basis for any further development of UniCal.</p>\r\r<p>This document contains the following sections:</p>\r<ul><li>Executive Summary</li>\r<li>Application Context</li>\r<li>Functional Requirements</li>\r<li>Environmental Requirements</li>\r<li>Software Qualities</li>\r<li>Other Requirements</li>\r<li>Time Schedule</li>\r<li>Potential Risks</li>\r<li>Future Changes</li>\r<li>Glossary</li>\r<li>References</li></ul>\r\r<h2>Executive Summary</h2>\r\r<p>UniCal aims to provide a solution for scheduling campus events and\rpublicizing their information to UCI faculty, staff, students, and\rvisitors. The application allows customers to schedule, share, and view\revents via any computer running UniCal. UniCal facilitates communication\rby unifying and providing easy access to event information. Changes in\revents will be updated to users' schedules so that everybody is well\rinformed. By maintaining consistent and reliable event information,\rUniCal enables effective event arrangement and collaboration among\rusers. Retro Software anticipates that the overall effect of adopting\rUniCal will result in more accurate, efficient and convenient schedule\rcoordinating among UCI personnel.</p>\r\r<p>UniCal provides the following key features:</p>\r<dl>\r<dt>Scheduling and sharing events</dt>\r  <dd>A user can schedule events and group them into specific categories using UniCal. These events can be seen by other users of the system.</dd>\r<dt>Viewing events</dt>\r  <dd>A user can view all of the events in their calendar in either a weekly or monthly view.</dd>\r<dt>Event reminders</dt>\r  <dd>UniCal will provide reminders for a user by playing a sound and displaying a pop-up window with details of the event at a customizable time interval before each event.</dd>\r<dt>Task list</dt>\r  <dd>Users can also create a task list with deadlines and reminders to help them meet goals.</dd>\r</dl>\r\r<p>Some of the most important risks posed by the development of UniCal are the following:</p>\r<dl>\r<dt>Lack of adoption</dt>\r  <dd>Because there are many other calendaring systems currently on the market, it is possible that students, faculty, and staff will not adopt UniCal into their normal routine. This would effectively render the system as no more useful than current approaches to informing people of events.</dd>\r<dt>Usability</dt>\r  <dd>help encourage adoption of the system, UniCal must be extremely intuitive and easy to use.</dd>\r<dt>Rapid development</dt>\r  <dd>The schedule according to which UniCal will be developed is extremely aggressive to ensure that another company will not develop a similar product first and claim the market. Other qualities cannot be sacrificed as a result of this rapid development.</dd>\r</dl>\r\r<!--Although the contents of this document were thoroughly verified, it may still occur that some requirements are inconclusive or ambiguous. If it is so determined, it is requested that Retro Software Inc. be contacted via e-mail at shendric@uci.edu to resolve the issue.-->\r\r<h2>Application Context</h2>\r\r<p>UniCal will be used in the institutional environment, UC, Irvine,\rwhere scheduling and coordinating events can be difficult because of\rthe large numbers of people involved. The introduction of UniCal should\rreduce the effort required to coordinate schedules among multiple people\rby automating much of the effort of keeping everyone's schedule up to\rdate. Adopting UniCal will result in substantial change for UCI. It will\rrequire that the application be installed on each person's computer,\rand that the application be used as the primary means of scheduling and\rcoordinating events on campus.</p>\r\r<p>Users of UniCal fall into two different roles: administrators, and\rusers: Administrators of UniCal have all of the same functionality as a\ruser, but in addition are responsible for managing the different accounts\rof the system. They may create, delete, and edit user accounts, as well\ras other administrator accounts. Should users forget their password, it\ris the responsibility of an administrator to reset their password so that\rthey may once again gain access to the system. Should an administrator\rforget their password, they may have the password e-mailed to the e-mail\raddress associated with their account.</p>\r\r<p>Users of the UniCal system use the system to schedule and share\revents. Users may be faculty, staff, students, or even offices who wish\rto publicize office events. Users may create events, schedule reminders\rfor events, specify recurrences for events, and group events together\rinto categories. The categories that users create may be shared with\rother users of the system and included on their calendars. Users may\ralso maintain a private task list of tasks that need to be completed.</p>\r\r<p>It is the hope of UCI that UniCal will eventually be used by other\rcampuses. Such a change would require the application to be highly\rscalable and likely require instances of the UniCal system to interoperate\rsince, due to political issues, it is unlikely that all campuses will\rshare one instance.</p>\r\r<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>\r<!-- look into setting up counter-increment/counter-reset with css -->\r<ol>\r<li>Data Entities\r  <ol><li>Accounts\r    <ol><li>each

be able to run on\rboth platforms.</p>\r\r<p>UCI has also hired a consultant regarding programming languages, and,\rbased on her report recommends that UniCal be implemented in Java, to\rensure portability across platforms as well as easy maintainability. Use\rof the JDK 1.4 is expected.</p>\r\r<h2>Other Requirements</h2>\r<p>Users should interface with UniCal through a stand alone application\ron their machines.</p>\r\r<p>The cost of development for the UniCal system must not exceed\r$399,999.98. UCI has consulted with financial analysts to determine\rthat this is the maximum amount the system can cost without becoming\runprofitable.</p>\r\r<p>Retro Software Inc. should carefully document all decisions made,\respecially decisions pertaining to changes in this document (and\rsubsequent documents; always per agreement with UCI). </p>\r\r<p>Retro Software Inc. will deliver detailed user manuals for the UniCal system.</p>\r\r<h2>Software Qualities</h2>\r<dl>\r<dt>User-friendliness</dt>\r  <dd>Because many of UniCal's users are expected to be people with\r  minimal to no time to learn a complicated new system, it is imperative\r  that the system be as user-friendly as possible.</dd>\r<dt>Correctness</dt> \r  <dd>Because UCI wants the system to be widely used, it is important\r  that UniCal perform all of its requirements correctly and does not\r  result in the proliferation of inaccurate or incomplete information.</dd>\r<dt>Reliability</dt> \r  <dd>Reliability of UniCal is not essential, but nonetheless\r  important. The accepted rate of failure is one crash per month. Any\r  failure rate above this will create an unfavorable impression of UCI\r  towards Retro Software.</dd>\r<dt>Performance</dt>\r  <dd>Performance is crucial to UniCal---if the system is too\r  slow, customers may revert to sending e-mails and using word of\r  mouth. Synchronizing events with UniCal should take no more than one\r  second for every fifty events. All other operations must be performed\r  nearly instantaneously.</dd>\r<dt>Reusability</dt>\r  <dd>Reusability is important because it is hoped that UniCal will\r  eventually be adopted at all other UC campuses.</dd>\r<dt>Extensibility</dt>\r  <dd>Several future enhancements for UniCal have already been proposed,\r  and there will undoubtedly be more forthcoming. Therefore, it is\r  critical that UniCal can be extended with relative ease.</dd>\r<dt>Evolvability</dt>\r  <dd>UniCal is expected to undergo significant changes as UCI determines\r  which features are most important to its population. Evolvability is\r  central to this goal.</dd>\r<dt>Robustness</dt>\r  <dd>UniCal must not crash if a user enters incorrect or invalid data,\r  or performs some otherwise unexpected action. A reasonable response\r  that allows the application to resume normal operation must be given.</dd>\r<dt>Verifiability</dt>\r  <dd>Although it is preferable that the system undergo formal, thorough\r  verification and testing before deployment, this is not feasible with\r  the rigorous time schedule desired by UCI. However, extensive testing\r  of the accuracy of the system's functionality should be performed\r  before release.</dd>\r<dt>Maintainability</dt>\r  <dd>UCI anticipates that UniCal will be used over long periods of time,\r  eventually by large numbers of users. Due to this fact, the likelihood\r  of several future enhancements, and the high probability of an equally\r  tight time schedule for their development, it is imperative that UniCal\r  be easily maintainable.</dd>\r<dt>Reparability</dt>\r  <dd>Because UniCal is being developed under such a tight time schedule,\r  it is likely that testing will not be done as thoroughly as desired,\r  and some faults will make it into the product. Therefore, the system\r  must be easily repairable in order to fix these defects in a timely\r  manner so as not to disrupt the business of UCI.</dd>\r<dt>Safety</dt>\r  <dd>Since UniCal is not a safety-critical application, there are no\r  safety concerns.</dd>\r<dt>Portability</dt>\r  <dd>Even though UniCal will be implemented entirely in Java, a\r  highly portable language, portability will still need to be considered\r  in the design and implementation of the system. It is UCI's desire\r  that no features of UniCal will violate commonly accepted standards\r  for each platform.</dd>\r<dt>Understandability</dt>\r  <dd>To support evolvability, reparability, and maintainability, it is\r  imperative that all aspects of UniCal be easily understood, even to\r  future developers who are not currently involved in the creation of\r  the system.</dd>\r<dt>Interoperability</dt>\r  <dd>For this current set of requirements, the interoperability\r  of UniCal with any other application is not needed. However, it is\r  of prime importance that UniCal interoperate with other calendaring\r  systems in future versions.</dd>\r<dt>Productivity</dt>\r  <dd>Because UCI would like to release the UniCal application as quickly\r  as possible, it is desirable that the productivity of all involved in\r  the development of UniCal be supported and facilitated with quality\r  processes and tools as much as possible. However, limited funding is\r  available for this requirement, so it must be foregone.</dd>\r<dt>Size</dt>\r  <dd>Hard drive space and memory are abundant nowadays---size is not\r  an issue.</dd>\r<dt>Scalability</dt>\r  <dd>It is important that UniCal be able to scale to support the entire\r  population of UCI, and perhaps, the UC system. Therefore, scalability\r  is an important issue to consider in the development of UniCal.</dd>\r<dt>Timeliness</dt>\r  <dd>It is imperative that all artifacts of the UniCal system be\r  delivered on time.</dd>\r<dt>Visibility</dt>\r  <dd>Due to the rigorous time schedule, extra time and effort to make\r  the project status visible should be forfeited.</dd>\r</dl>\r\r<h2>Time Schedule</h2>\r<p>The development schedule for UniCal is as follows:</p>\r<ul>\r  <li>Design must be completed by February 26th,  2004 at 2:00 PM.</li>\r  <li>Implementation and module testing must be completed by March 9th,\r  2004 at 2:00 PM.</li>\r  <li>System testing must be completed by March 18th, 2004 at 2:00 PM,\r  however this date may be changed.</li>\r</ul>\r\r<h2>Potential Risks</h2>\r<dl>\r<dt>Difficult to use</dt>\r  <dd>UniCal has a lot of features and addresses every kind of\r  user. Furthermore, a significant portion of its expected user base\r  is not computer literate. Hence, it is possible that some users might\r  find it too difficult to use UniCal.</dd>\r<dt>Limited schedule</dt>\r  <dd>The schedule according to which UniCal is being developed is\r  extremely aggressive and may result in a product that does not\r  adequately satisfy the needs of UCI.</dd>\r<dt>Lack of adequate support processes and tools</dt>\r  <dd>A project of this size would ideally be supported by a number\r  of quality software engineering processes and tools. Unfortunately,\r  UCI lacks the funds necessary to obtain these tools.</dd>\r<dt>Privacy issues</dt>\r  <dd>As all categories will be viewable by every user, some users may\r  feel uncomfortable letting other people see their (private) events. This\r  could cause users to refrain from using UniCal.</dd>\r</dl>\r\r<h2>Future Changes</h2>\r<dl>\r<dt>Programmatic API for administrator functionality</dt>\r  <dd>In future versions, UCI may want to be able to programmatically\r  access administrator functionality so that the creation and removal\r  of user accounts can be done automatically by computers processing\r  incoming and outgoing students, staff, and faculty.</dd>\r<dt>Web &amp; PDA interface</dt>\r  <dd>In future versions, UCI may want to create Web interfaces and PDA\r  interfaces to supplement UniCal.</dd>\r<dt>Permissions</dt>\r  <dd>In future versions, UCI may want to introduce permissions to allow\r  users of UniCal to keep certain events private.</dd>\r<dt>Interface with other calendaring applications</dt>\r  <dd>In future versions, UCI may want UniCal to interface with other\r  calendaring applications. Minimally this will involve sharing event\r  information such as through importing and exporting .vcal files (see\r  http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcal-10.txt). However, support of more automated\r  techniques such as scheduling meetings may also be desired.</dd>\r</dl>\r</body>\r</html> \r\r", "encoding": "ascii"}
