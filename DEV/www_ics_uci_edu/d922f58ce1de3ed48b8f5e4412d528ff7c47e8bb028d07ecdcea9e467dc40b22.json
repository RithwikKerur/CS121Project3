Arkin, Michael A. Bender, Joseph S. B.\nMitchell, and Valentin Polischuk</h2>\n\n<h2>Presented by Keven A. Wortman</h2>\n\n<p>\nAbstract:\n<p>\nWe introduce the snowblower problem (SBP), a new optimization\nproblem that is closely related to milling problems and to some\nmaterial-handling problems.  The objective in the SBP is to compute a\nshort tour for the snowblower to follow to remove all the snow from a\ndomain (driveway, sidewalk, etc.).  When a snowblower passes over each\nregion along the tour, it displaces snow into a nearby region.  The\nconstraint is that if the snow is piled too high, then the snowblower\ncannot clear the pile.\n<p>\nWe give an algorithmic study of the SBP.  We show that in general, the\nproblem is NP-complete, and we present polynomial-time approximation\nalgorithms for removing snow under various assumptions about the operation\nof the snowblower.  Most commercially-available snowblowers allow the user\nto control the direction in which the snow is thrown.  We differentiate\nbetween the cases in which the snow can be thrown in any direction, in any\ndirection except backwards, and only to the right.  For all cases, we give\nconstant-factor approximation algorithms; the constants increase as the\nthrow direction becomes more restricted.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
