It is not an evaluation\nversion, and does not require payment or donation to receive the\ncomplete package. Everything you need is here.<BR>\n\n<H3>Downloading &amp; Installing GraphTool for Windows</H3>\n\n<P>\nComplete the following steps, below, to install GraphTool for\nWindows.  It will require approximately 7 MB of free hard disk\nspace.  This installation includes all of the manuals that you\nwill need to use GraphTool.\n<OL>\n<LI>Create the directory C:\\GraphTool, using whatever method you\nlike.\n<LI>Click on the link titled: &quot;Download GraphTool for Windows,&quot;\nbelow.\n<LI>If your Internet browser has a viewer configured for .zip\nfiles, downloading will begin immediately.  Otherwise you will\nbe asked how you want to handle the file.  Select &quot;Save to\nDisk&quot; and select the directory C:\\GraphTool.\n<LI>Using your favorite Windows '95 ZIP decompressor (we recommend\nWinZip '95), decompress the contents of graphtool.zip into the\ndirectory C:\\GraphTool.  <I>IMPORTANT:  </I>Make sure your ZIP\nprogram supports LONG FILE NAMES!\n<LI>Create a new shortcut to GraphTool in your Programs folder\n(i.e. Start <TT>-&gt;</TT> Programs).  See the steps below if\nyou have forgotten how to do this.\n<LI>Congratulations, installation should be complete!  You can now\nprint the manuals and run GraphTool for Windows.\n</OL>\n\n<P>\n<FONT COLOR=#000000 FACE=\"Book Antiqua\"></FONT>\n<P>\n<A HREF=\"/~dillenco/graphtool/windows/graphtool.zip\" >Download GraphTool for Windows</A>\n\n<H3>Creating a shortcut for GraphTool:</H3>\n<OL>\n<LI>Right click on the Task Bar.\n<LI>Left click on Properties.\n<LI>Left click on the Start Menu Programs tab.\n<LI>Left click on Add&#133;\n<LI>Type in C:\\GraphTool\\GraphTool\n<LI>Left click on the Next button until it reads Finish.  Left\nclick on Finish.\n<LI>Click OK on the TaskBar Properties dialog.\n<LI>Congratulations!  You have now created a shortcut to GraphTool.\n</OL>\n\n<P>\n\n<H3>Development Tools </H3>\n\n<P>\n<A HREF=\"/~dillenco/graphtool/windows/graphtoolsdk.zip\">GraphTool SDK</A>--This\nis a collection of four C++ files that define the GraphTool Plug-In\ninterface. If you would like to write your own GraphTool Plug-Ins,\nyou will need this code. Note: This code requires that you have\naccess to the Win32 header files, and can create a Win32 console\napplication. This code has been tested with: Microsoft Visual\nC++ 4.0. \n<H3>Algorithm Plug-Ins </H3>\n\n<P>\nThis section lists the plug-ins currently available for GraphTool\nfor Windows. This list will change often, so be sure to check\nback. Also, if you have written any algorithms for GraphTool (using\nthe GraphTool SDK) that you would like to share, send email to\njcahill@ics.uci.edu, and I will incorporate them here, with full\ncredit to you!\n<P>\n<A HREF=\"/~dillenco/graphtool/windows/plugins/random.exe\">Random</A>--Generates\na user-specified number of randomly placed vertices.
