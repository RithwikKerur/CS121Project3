We have already covered most of these topics in class. If you don't quite finish by Monday's lab, try to finish by Wednesday; you need to develop these skills. </FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4> <B>(1)</B> As you read Chapter 3 of the HtDP\n  text, do exercises 3.1.1 and 3.1.2.  If  you understand why the left-hand\n  side of Figure 5 is better than the right-hand side, and if you promise\n  to write your code following the style on the left, then you may <I>skip</I> exercises 3.1.3 and 3.1.4; otherwise, do them.  Look at exercise 3.2.1 to\n  be sure you understand how to do it.  From the exercises 3.3.1 through 3.3.6,\n  pick a couple and do them (but save 3.3.4 to do with your partner in the\n  lab).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(2)</B>  As you read Chapter 4 of the HtDP\ntext, do exercises 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and a couple of the parts of 4.2.1.  Do\na few of the translations at the start of 4.2.2; formulate a contract and\npurpose for the first one only, </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">in-interval-1?</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>;\nevaluate by hand just the expression </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">(in-interval-1?\n-2)</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>.  Do the last part of 4.2.3; do\n4.3.1 and 4.3.2 by hand; do 4.3.3 by hand or in DrScheme.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(3)</B> Skim over Chapter 5 of the HtDP\ntext; for our purposes, we can design our programs to use strings rather than symbols.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(4)</B>  As you read Chapter 6, do exercise\n6.1.1; also do some parts of 6.3.1 and 6.3.2.  Do one part of 6.4.1; do\n6.4.2; do one part of 6.5.1.    (You can skim sections 6.2, 6.6, and 6.7;\ninstead of the draw.ss teachpack described in the text, we&#39;re using the more modern teachpacks, image.ss and universe.ss.)</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4>The authors enhance the design recipe with\nsomething they call a template.  The point of a template is to lay out all\nthe components of the inputs that you might want to use in your solution.\n In the function you write, you might not need every component you lay out\nin the template, and you might use them in a different order than you listed\nthem in the template.  But the template gives a menu of the likely parts you'll need and the skeleton of a function to process that kind of input. A professional chef sets up a work area with open containers of the common ingredients ready to use; it's called the <i>mise-en-place</i> (literally, put in place); the template for your program is the same idea.</FONT></P>\n\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(5) </B>As you read Chapter 7 of the HtDP\n  text, do exercises 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, 7.3.1, and 7.5.1.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(6)</B> Skim briefly over Intermezzo 1\n  (Chapter 8), just to get a brief feel for the ideas.  You&#39;ll revisit\n  some of them in ICS 22 and CS 141 (programming languages). </FONT></P>\n\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Garamond\" SIZE=4><B>(7)</B> Look at the remaining sections of the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/scheme/finger.html\">Scheme Finger Exercises</a>. You don't have to write the answers down or turn them in, but make sure you know how to do them.</FONT><BR />\n</P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Based in part on ICS H21 assignments by David\nG.
