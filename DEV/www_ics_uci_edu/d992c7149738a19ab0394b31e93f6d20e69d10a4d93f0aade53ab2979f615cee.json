Try to do it\nby Monday, but expect that it will generate some questions\nthat you'll need to get answered before you can finish it.<!-- Since Monday is a holiday, ask your questions by Email to <font face=\"Courier New, Courier, monospace\">i41@uci.edu</font> so you're ready to show your answers at the start of Wednesday's lab. --></FONT></P>\n\n<p><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(1)</B> Read Chapter 29, which talks about sequential programming and input/output, topics we've been doing since the first restaurant program. You can skip sections 29.5, 29.6, and 29.7.</FONT></p>\n<p><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><B>(2)</B>  At <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/DeusXercises.pdf\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/DeusXercises.pdf</code></A> there are a couple of problems that will give you some concrete practice\n  with machine-level programming.  Download the file, do the problems, and\n  turn them in (on paper) to the TA at the start of lab on Monday, if possible.  Each of\n  you should submit a solution individually because everyone should get the\n  practice of working through the steps.  But feel free to work together and\n  help each other out.  </FONT>\n</p>\n<P><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">We almost certainly will ask a question about machine\n  language and the Deus X on a quiz and on the final.  If we do, we will provide\n  a copy of the Deus X Instruction Set sheet; it would be nuts to expect anyone\n  to memorize it.</FONT><BR />\n</P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Based in part on ICS H21assignments by David\n    G.
