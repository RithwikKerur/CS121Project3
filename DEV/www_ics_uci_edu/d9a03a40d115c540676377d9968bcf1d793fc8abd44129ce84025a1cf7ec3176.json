The objective is to\nplace a minimum number of guards inside a simple polygon such that\nthe guards together can see the whole polygon. We say that a guard at\nposition $x$ sees a point $y$ if the line segment $xy$ is fully contained\nin the polygon. \nDespite an extensive study of the art gallery problem, it remained an\nopen question whether there are polygons given by integer coordinates\nthat require guard positions with irrational coordinates in any\noptimal solution. We give a positive answer to this question by\nconstructing a monotone polygon with integer coordinates that can be\nguarded by three guards only when we allow to place the guards at\npoints with irrational coordinates. Otherwise, four guards are\nneeded. By extending this example, we show that for every $n$, there is\npolygon which can be guarded by $3n$ guards with irrational coordinates\nbut need $4n$ guards if the coordinates have to be\nrational. Subsequently, we show that there are rectilinear polygons\ngiven by integer coordinates that require guards with irrational\ncoordinates in any optimal solution.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05475\">a preprint</a>\nby Mikkel Abrahamsen, Anna Adamaszek, and Tillmann Miltzow.)\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
