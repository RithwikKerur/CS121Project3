Everything on would ever need to know about the drug ecstacy\n(MDMA), is detailed in this document.

Consequently, I'm not doing very well on them.  How \ncan I study for the final so that I don't fail?</B><br>\nOn the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">ICS 1C Home Page</A>, \nclick on <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/schedule.html\">                     \n\"schedule.\"</A>  Move to the bottom of this page, and you will see a \nlisting for each one of the quizes in ICS 1C.  The information provided \nthere is a copy of each of the questions on the quiz you choose, along \nwith the answers.  By studying the answers to the quizes, you may get a \nbetter idea of what Dr. Franklin is looking for in terms of answers on \nfuture quizes.  Furthermore, if you study each quiz very carefully you \nmay be able to do quite well on the final, even though you did not do \nwell on the quizes themselves.  This is because much of the information \ncovered on the quizes is very likely to show up on the final.  \n\n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>I'll be traveling around the nation and the world \nthis summer.  I really like to attend rave parties, where they play House \nand Techno music.  Since it is hard to find these parties, and you \nususally have to know someone to find out where the good ones are, how \ncan I find out where to go for these parties while I'm on the road?</B><br>\n\nThe \"RAVE\" scene has it's own listing on the world wide web!  This seems \namazing, since most of these parties are illegal.  In order to find out \nwhere the party is in any part of the U.S. or many parts of Eastern \nEurope, just use the <A \nHREF=\"http://204.62.130.120/~eric/dblist.html\">Global Rave Information \nDatabase</A>.  From there, you can select any region where Raves are \nhappening, including San Francisco, L.A., Chicago, New York, the U.K., \nand Germany.  After selecting the desired region, you can click on \"view\" \nand you will get a list of all the up and comming rave parties in the \narea.  So, no matter where you are, you will be able to find out where a \nrave is, as long as you can access the world wide web.  \n\n<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>I am enrolled in a Physics class which is a study of \nthe earth's atmosphere.
