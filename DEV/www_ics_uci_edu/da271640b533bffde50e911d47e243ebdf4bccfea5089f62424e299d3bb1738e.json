Proposed\r\n measures may include, but are not restricted to, coordinating policies and guidelines, and setting\r\n community-wide institutions for reporting and oversight. The primary goal should be a determination\r\n to deter and root out such behavior in the theory community. The issues of false reporting and due\r\n process should be taken into account. The committee is expected to conduct the necessary research\r\n on existing practices. The committee will submit a report to the appointing organizations by September 30, 2018.\"\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3> Membership </h3>\r\n<p>\r\n  Members of the ToC community should feel free to contact any member of\r\n  the committee  if they have input they would like to share related\r\n  to the charge.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Avrim Blum (email: [firstname] at ttic.edu)</li>\r\n  <li>Erin Chambers (email: [firstname].[lastname] - at - slu.edu)</li>\r\n  <li>Martin Farach-Colton (email: [firstname] at [lastname].com)</li>\r\n  <li>Michal Feldman (email: [firstname].[lastname] at cs.tau.ac.il)</li>\r\n  <li>Sandy Irani, chair.
