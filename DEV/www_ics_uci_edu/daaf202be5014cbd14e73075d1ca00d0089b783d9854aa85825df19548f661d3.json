For simplicity, you may assume \njobs cannot be interrupted--once it is scheduled on the CPU,\na job runs for a number of time slices equal to its length.\nYour simulator must output the name of the job running on the CPU in\neach time slice and must process a sequence of commands,\none per time slice, each of\nwhich is of one the following forms:\n<ul>\n<li> add <i>name</i> <i>n</i> <i>p</i>\n<br>\nwhich adds the new job, <i>name</i>, with length <i>n</i> and\npriority <i>p</i>. For example, the following command adds a job\nDogFace of length 15 and priority 5:\n<pre>\nadd DogFace 15 5\n</pre>\n<li>\ncontinue\n<br>\nwhich indicates that there is no new job for this time slice.\n<li>\nkill <i>name</i>\n<br>\nwhich kills the job, <i>name</i>, that is, it removes it from the collection\nof waiting jobs.  If the job, <i>name</i>, is the one currently\nrunning, it stops it and starts performing the next highest-priority\njob waiting to be performed.\n</ul>\n<p>\nNote: you may use the following class in your program:\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Scanner.html\">\njava.util.Scanner</a>\n<li>\n<a\nhref=\"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/PriorityQueue.html\">\njava.util.PriorityQueue</a>\n</ul>\nYou should read commands from System.in and output the name of the\njob running in each time slice to System.out.\n</body>\n\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
