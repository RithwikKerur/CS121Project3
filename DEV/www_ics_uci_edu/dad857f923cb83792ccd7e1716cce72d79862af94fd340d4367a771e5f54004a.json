When I later check the file back in, I\n&gt; may need to attach a particular update to a particular checkout operation.\n&gt; The cookie enables this (did I get it right, Chris?).\n&gt; \n&gt;   The kind of solution that youare thinking of does not allow that kind of\n&gt; control: a server could let me check out v 2.1 of /docs/misc more than\n&gt; once, and on check in the \"Derived-from:\" header does not uniquely identify\n&gt; which of the 3 checkouts is being affected. This is because they would all\n&gt; share the same \"Derived-from:\" header.\n\nI should clarify this.  The value of Content-Version and Derived-From\nis an opaque string or token.  There is no reason why the server could\nnot produce a different Content-Version for each checkout (although\nthere is also no reason why it needs to, since the notion of virtual\nsessions implies forking a resource, which is better expressed as a\ndifferent action upon committing those changes rather than as a pre-fork\nevery time the resource is checked out).  In any case, it is impossible\nfor Cookies to be more expressive than Content-Version, since anything\nthat can be placed in a Cookie can also be placed in an opaque string.\n\n.....Roy\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0139.html\">Larry Masinter: \"Re: Seiwald Q &amp; A -- \"GET for EDIT\" cookies\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0137.html\">Dave Long: \"Re: Seiwald Q &amp; A -- \"GET for EDIT\" cookies\"</a>\n<li> <b>Maybe in reply to:</b> <a href=\"0134.html\">David G.
