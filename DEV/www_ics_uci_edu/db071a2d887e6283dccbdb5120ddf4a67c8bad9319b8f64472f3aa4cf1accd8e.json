Usually this optimization\nrequires further thought and effort, beyond our initial working version\nof a program. </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>So it is with writing.  We all disdain wordiness,\nbut it takes an author time and effort to pare prose down to its elegant,\nefficient essence.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>This assignment:</B>  Find a passage of\nnonfiction prose writing approximately five pages (1500 words) long, and\nrevise it to maintain the same content in three pages (900 words).  Carry\nthis out at two levels:  Pare down the verbosity by rewriting individual\nsentences and phrases (e.g., substitute &quot;many&quot; for &quot;a number\nof&quot;) and remove any content that isn&#39;t strictly necessary to the\nauthor&#39;s message (this will require you to consider the author&#39;s\naudience and what they really do--and don&#39;t--need to know).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Turn in three things:  (a) a copy of the original\npassage (a photocopy is fine), (b) another copy of the original passage\nmarked with your revisions, and (c) a clean copy of your final, shortened\nrevision.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>For a bit of extra credit, you may shorten\nthe same passage still more by substituting appropriate diagrams, mathematical\nformulas, or itemized lists for the equivalent prose, and turning in that\nstill-smaller version as well.  But your original 40% reduction from five\npages to three should be done in prose alone.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Further guidelines</B>:  Refer to the course\nreference sheet for other advice and requirements.
