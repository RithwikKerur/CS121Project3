Papaefthymiou's research</title>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n\n<h1> Marios C. Papaefthymiou - Research Summary </h1>\n<hr>\n<p>\n\n<! His research has\nfocused on charge-recovery (a.k.a. adiabatic or energy recycling)\narchitectures that have the potential to decrease energy consumption\nby orders of magnitude.  In practice, however, this potential has\nremained unrealized, due to the high overheads and relatively slow\noperation of early implementations.> \n\n<!--<a href=\"http://www.eecs.umich.edu/acal/GHzClassRecovery/\"> -->\n\nPapaefthymiou's research interests are in the design of\nenergy-efficient computers.  Together with his students, he has\npioneered the exploration of charge-recovery (a.k.a. adiabatic or\nenergy recycling) technologies, demonstrating over the span of almost\ntwo decades a broad variety of charge-recovery silicon prototypes that\nachieve substantial (sometimes order of magnitude) energy savings over\ntheir conventional counterparts.  He has also pioneered the\ncommercialization of charge-recovery technologies, co-founding Cyclos\nSemiconductor to develop charge-recovery design solutions for\nenergy-efficient high-performance clocking.  The Cyclos technology\nmarks the first-ever successful deployment of charge recovery in a\nhigh-volume commercial product and is now used in multi-GHz server\nchips from AMD and IBM.\n\n</p><p> In addition to energy-efficient design, Papaefthymiou has made\ncontributions to the design and optimization of high-performance\ndigital systems, with a focus on asymptotically efficient retiming\nalgorithms.  He has also made contributions to other areas of design\nautomation, including algorithms and tools for power estimation and\ndesign complexity management.\n\n</p><p> Papaefthymiou has co-authored award-winning papers at the 2013\nInternational Conference on Architectural Support for Programming\nLanguages and Operating Systems, the 2012 IEEE Symposium on High\nPerformance Computer Architecture, the 2001 ACM/IEEE Design Automation\nConference, and the 1995 ACM/IEEE Design Automation Conference.  Among\nother distinctions, he has received the Arthur Greer Memorial Prize\nfrom Yale College, the Outstanding Achievement Award from the EECS\nDepartment at U. Michigan, the Ted Kennedy Family Faculty Team\nExcellence Award from the College of Engineering at U. Michigan, the\nFaculty Recognition Award from the Graduate School at U. Michigan, a\nYoung Investigator Award from ARO, CAREER and ITR Awards from NSF, and\nmultiple IBM Faculty Partnership Awards.\n\n</p><p> Over the years, Papaefthymiou's research has been supported by\nNSF, ARO, DARPA, SRC, Broadcom Foundation, IBM, and Intel.\n</p></body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
