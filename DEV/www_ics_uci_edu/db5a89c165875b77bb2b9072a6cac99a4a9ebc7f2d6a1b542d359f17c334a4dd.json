2013</strong><p><i>Forbes</i><p><strong>Women In Tech: We're Init(Together)</strong><p><strong>By Tara Tiger Brown</strong><br><p><P>\r\n<I>Read the story below or view it on the\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarabrown/2013/04/16/women-in-tech-were-inittogether/\">Forbes</A> website.</I>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Recently I had the pleasure of connecting with other women in tech across Southern California: young women just starting to think about their careers and women who are looking to make a change. After all the negativity related to women in tech in the media lately it was refreshing to see both new and familiar faces and everyone in high spirits. I led the class at General Assembly, &ldquo;<a title=\"Women in Tech\" href=\"https://generalassemb.ly/education/women-in-tech-intro-to-the-la-startup-community/women-in-tech-intro-to-the-la-startup-community/1373\">Women in Tech: Intro to LA Startup Community</a>&rdquo; and delivered the opening Keynote at the <a title=\"init(together)\" href=\"http://init-together.com/\">init(together) conference</a>&nbsp;in addition to participating on the Startup panel. There was a lot of overlap between the two groups including their backgrounds and types of questions which made me realize a few things: 1) the idea of creating a tech startup is still very much a new concept to many people and they aren&rsquo;t sure where to begin or find the right resources 2) we aren&rsquo;t doing a good enough job supporting women who want to make a career change into the tech industry 3) we are in desperate need of great mentors.</p> \r\n<p>The overarching advice that I exclaimed rather loudly to both groups was summarized very nicely on the <a title=\"Girls in Tech LA\" href=\"http://www.girlsintechla.org/v1/advice-to-those-who-are-new-to-the-los-angeles-startup-community/\">Girls in Tech LA website</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">:</span></p> \r\n<p>1. Silicon Beach is flooded, it&rsquo;s okay to expand. There are areas of growth downtown, in Orange County and more. Find the area you like and the vibe you like.<br /> 2. Find a mentor, or several mentors. You are going to feel like you&rsquo;re alone at times and you need the support of someone who has &ldquo;been there&rdquo; to help guide you through the tough times.<br /> 3. Just do it (or, some call this, JFDI!). So many people get frozen at the start&mdash;just keep moving.<br /> 4. You don&rsquo;t need to pay designers and have a master plan at the start. Start by just sketching on paper, getting feedback from family and friends. There is nothing wrong with roughsketches, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they look like your second grade artwork.<br /> 5. Don&rsquo;t feel like you must be a coder. Everyone is obsessed with code, but startups take all types.<br /> 6. Your startup needs to be&mdash;must be&ndash;something you really, really like. It&rsquo;s important to do what you&rsquo;re passionate about if you want to succeed; don&rsquo;t just be in it for the big exit.<br /> 7. Tara highly recommended Steve Blanks&rsquo; lean startup techniques (and he has videos!).<br /> 8. There is no shame in using WordPress.</p> \r\n<p>The one point that wasn&rsquo;t summarized that I touched on more during the init(together) conference was around making things. I co-founded and am the Chief Encouragement Officer at the <a title=\"LA Makerspace\" href=\"http://lamakerspace.com\">LA Makerspace</a> in Downtown LA. Recently we held a pallet furniture building class and a woman, about my age, joined us to build a stool. She said that she had her electrical engineering degree and her husband had a mechanical engineering degree and neither of them had actually ever built anything. Seems strange but that is <a title=\"The Death of Shop Class\" href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Ftarabrown%2F2012%2F05%2F30%2Fthe-death-of-shop-class-and-americas-high-skilled-workforce%2F&amp;ei=AGRsUdrSNanHigLchoGICw&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0OeNCnG0_Ii53iSJKnXVomHHPmg&amp;sig2=SDJmwRkj1vawKWM1eeHVxw&amp;bvm=bv.45175338,d.cGE\">where we are headed in the US, all theory, no hands-on expertise</a>.</p> \r\n<p>Related to the importance of making, my friend <a title=\"Debbie Chachra\" href=\"http://www.debcha.com/\">Debbie Chachra</a>, an Associate Professor of Materials Science at the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham, MA. emailed the following to me:</p> \r\n<blockquote>\r\n <p>Most women leave technical fields, not because they don&rsquo;t have the technical chops, but because they don&rsquo;t think they do. In education psychology research, we talk about self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is your confidence that you can do specific things (as opposed to general self-confidence). There are three basic ways to develop self-efficacy: to have role models (hi, Tara!), to get social affirmation that you can do things, or to have mastery experiences (that is, to actually do things).</p> \r\n <p>Women and tech get severely shortchanged on the first two. Not only are there few role models, but there are gender schemas that constantly, and in a very low-grade way, tell women that they don&rsquo;t belong (the classic example is not offering T-shirts in women&rsquo;s sizes, but it&rsquo;s everything from people looking surprised when you tell them what you do to other people asking your boyfriend for math help, even though you&rsquo;re better at math). So women don&rsquo;t get anywhere near the social affirmation that men do.</p> \r\n <p>That leaves mastery experiences. People should Make Stuff. No one can take that away from you. If you have actually done something, you know you can do it. Other people know you can do it. Plus, it&rsquo;s fun!</p>\r\n</blockquote> \r\n<p><strong>How Did We Get Here?</strong></p> \r\n<p>When I was writing my keynote speech I started to ask myself, &ldquo;what does it mean to be a woman in tech? Why are we different than men in tech? And more importantly why are there less of us?&rdquo; We&rsquo;ve all seen the stats: women currently comprise 18% of computer science undergraduate majors, down from 37% in 1985. I found some fascinating historical information on the <a title=\"Clayman Institute\" href=\"http://gender.stanford.edu/\">The Clayman Institute for Gender Research website</a>.&nbsp;Did you know that the earliest computer programmers were women and that the programming field was once stereotyped as female? It&rsquo;s pretty hard to believe.</p> \r\n<blockquote>\r\n <p>It&rsquo;s true, however, that the very first programmers were women and that the field remained open to women for many years thereafter. In the early 1940s, the University of Pennsylvania hired six women to work on its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC\">ENIAC&nbsp;</a>machine, which was one of the world&rsquo;s first electronic computers. These six women, known by contemporaries as the &ldquo;ENIAC girls,&rdquo; were charged with &ldquo;setting up&rdquo; the ENIAC to perform computation tasks. They are widely celebrated as the world&rsquo;s first computer programmers.</p> \r\n <p>However, says Ensmenger, the presence of these women did not indicate that managers of the ENIAC project had modern attitudes toward women in the workforce. Rather, managers hired women because they expected programming to be a low-skill clerical function, akin to filing, typing, or telephone switching. Assuming that the real &ldquo;brain work&rdquo; in electronic computing would be limited to the hardware side, managers reserved these tasks for male engineers.</p>\r\n</blockquote> \r\n<p>Weren&rsquo;t they surprised to find out that in fact programming required intellect and complex problem solving skills. Programming quickly became associated with a male-stereotyped activity like math or playing chess. But because there weren&rsquo;t enough men to fill the positions, hiring managers had to continue recruiting women.&nbsp;The industry started heavily favoring men. Men created their own associations, educational requirements were added as well as hiring aptitude tests that relied heavily on math skills, which at that time more men were taking in school.</p> \r\n<p>Now this next part really ties it all together for me. There was another personality test that was being administered &ndash; to test the personality profile of applicants, and it was definitely written with male applicants in mind.</p> \r\n<blockquote>\r\n <p>Based on a series of preference questions, these tests sought to indentify job applicants who were the ideal programming &ldquo;type.&rdquo; According to test developers, successful programmers had most of the same personality traits as other white-collar professionals. The important distinction, however, was that programmers displayed &ldquo;disinterest in people&rdquo; and that they disliked &ldquo;activities involving close personal interaction.&rdquo; It is these personality profiles, says Ensmenger, that originated our modern stereotype of the anti-social computer geek.</p>\r\n</blockquote> \r\n<p>All of this started more than 70 years ago and we are still dealing with the repercussions.</p> \r\n<p>The good news, according to <a title=\"Why So Few\" href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aauw.org%2Ffiles%2F2013%2F02%2FWhy-So-Few-Women-in-Science-Technology-Engineering-and-Mathematics.pdf\">American Association of University Women&rsquo;s 2010 report</a>&nbsp;is that girls are now taking math and science classes and doing very well at them, and even receiving higher grade point averages than boys. However, despite the substantial gains in girls&rsquo; performance in math and science in grade and high school, men still dominate STEM college majors and careers. Girls and boys will perform similarly in earlier education settings, but once entering college, girls are less likely to choose a STEM field as their area of specialization.&nbsp;The bottom line is that young people self-select into careers where they believe they will fit in. There is a feeling of comfort that comes from feeling like you belong.</p> \r\n<p>This quote from an interview with Dr. Maria Klawe, President of Harvey Mudd College is a good reminder that those that speak loudest often say nothing, &ldquo;if there are some male students in the class who seem to know way more than you do, ignore it, because they tend to show it off more. Look for an instructor who is encouraging, because that makes a huge difference. &rdquo;</p> \r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t think that we should be discouraged by these stats and stories, instead we should look around at what advantages we have as women. There are plenty of jobs to go around, to the tune of 1.4 million new technology jobs by 2018, we need to ensure our Github repositories are up-to-date, we are contributing to projects, participating in hackathons, sharing our work and honing our skills. Will less women in the field it means it&rsquo;s just that much easier for a woman in computing to standout than it is for a man. There are a lot of grants and competitions being created to try and get more of us into computing and most definitely take advantage of the media who are always looking for interesting women in tech stories. I should mention that there are also plenty of technology jobs that are not focused on programming, for example: user interaction design, database administration, system administration, project management and more.</p> \r\n<p><strong>Mentors Are a Must</strong><br /> It is proven that mentors and positive role models have a significant impact on whether girls who are interested in computer science choose that as their college major and also whether they choose to stay in the computing field.</p> \r\n<p>Mentors come in all shapes and sizes. There is the formal wax on wax off formal relationships, advisors, just-in-time mentors for projects. They might be a friend or family member, instructor, a peer, or someone that answered a question on Stack Exchange.</p> \r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that you are a potential mentor or coach because you have expertise in something that someone else doesn&rsquo;t. Maybe you are fantastic in building an iOS app, or can debug some CSS issue or great at delivering talks. We live in a society where we are always wondering what someone else can do for us, stop for a second, think about what you can do to support someone else. I promise you that the more you put yourself out there, what the community delivers back to you is three-fold.</p> \r\n<p>I want to very briefly touch on the ugly side of the tech industry and where a great mentor can really be useful. And this isn&rsquo;t just limited to tech but it seems to get highlighted the most in the media. People can be jerks. Some people turn into trolls and seek people out to get a rise out of them. And it&rsquo;s not just the men that are cruel, women are equally so. In some ways I feel the burn more when a woman is hurtful because I always feel like they should have my back even if they don&rsquo;t agree with me.</p> \r\n<p>In 1999 Carly Fiorina became CEO of Hewlett Packard the the first woman to run a Fortune 20 company. This is an <a title=\"Carly Fiorina\" href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-02-28/carly-fiorina-on-marissa-sheryl-and-women-in-tech\">interview</a> with her earlier this year:</p> \r\n<p>Q: Is it easier being a female CEO now?<br /> A: I think it has gotten better [being a female CEO]. There are more women CEOs. But women are subjected to a higher level of scrutiny and criticism than men, in every field.&rdquo;<br /> Q: What advice do you give to young women?<br /> A: Recognize the reality that many of your co-workers, because they are men, will view you in a certain way. Some of them will be protective of you. Some of them will be threatened by you. Some will be genuinely interested in your development. Be realistic that you&rsquo;ll run across some attitudes that are frustrating. But don&rsquo;t get a chip on your shoulder. Don&rsquo;t make it your problem. Being here is a relatively new phenomenon in human history.<br /> Q: Do you think too few women lean in and stay committed to their careers? Was that a problem in your peer group?<br /> A: Women are more likely than men to get hurt by what people say about them. Don&rsquo;t. Just accept that people will talk about you. Don&rsquo;t dwell on it. Just keep going. It was more important to me to do the job I was hired to do. No matter what you do, people will talk about you.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        <p>How do we rise above when we are not treated respectfully... whether it&rsquo;s because we wrote a blog post some people didn&rsquo;t agree with, have a strong opinion in a work meeting or something else? First, we need to remember that we aren&rsquo;t alone, we have friends and family and community members to turn to when things are feeling rough and it will pass. The internet is fickle. And we need to focus on what is important and remind ourselves that we deserve to be here doing what have set out to do.</p> \r\n<p><strong>Embrace Your Community</strong><br /> Women technology groups provide women from beginner to expert with a supportive co-learning environment with other passionate and supportive learners to build the confidence and skills needed to be successful technologists and entrepreneurs. Mentorship and a peer network has proven to be a critical element for success in the male-dominated technology industry.</p> \r\n<p>There are many informal learning communities in Southern California, around the world and online and quite a few specifically for women. If you can&rsquo;t find a local community then I encourage you to start one. Platforms like meetup.com make it incredibly easy to create a group and i guarantee you that you will be found. At the class I led at General Assembly one woman told us she was an accountant but she always wanted to be a programmer so that was her next career move. She was struggling to find a group in the OC so we told her to create a new community and those of us in the class would help find people to join it.</p> \r\n<p>Showing up is 80% to success!</p> \r\n<p><strong>Contribute Contribute Contribute</strong><br /> I encourage any woman in tech to start their own projects, collaborate and to become involved in independent and open source projects with their peers and mentors.&nbsp;I cannot emphasize enough the importance of contributing. It&rsquo;s a great way to increase your skill level, meet others, and now repositories like Github are used as resumes, so the more you contribute to earlier on the more you will build up your resume before you even start job hunting.</p> \r\n<p>Hackerspaces always have really cool projects going on. One of Crash Space members was working on a rocket in his spare time and he got a job at SpaceX for doing so. It&rsquo;s kind of sad story, but my friend Basil is currently in jail in Syria without trial, the Creative Commons community that he contributed to has been rallying for more than a year to get him out of jail. On a positive note, the women that work at Mozilla are some of the most badass engineers that I know and they always have great Open Source projects that you can contribute to.</p> \r\n<p><strong>Career Choices</strong><br /> Something I am thankful for about current day versus when my grandparents were around is that we are no longer making lifelong career choices. We are going to change our jobs many times over the course of our working years. I can personally attest to this... I started out as a system administrator slash website administrator slash Admin Assistant at a Data Warehousing consulting company and now I&rsquo;m working with academics in a humanities department, I run a makerspace and work for Lady Gaga&rsquo;s Mom. I would never ever have guessed where I would end up today.</p> \r\n<p>You need to ask yourself, what are my passions? You are not limited to working for the big software companies although that&rsquo;s great if that&rsquo;s what you really want to do. Computers are everywhere... what industry do you want to be in?&nbsp;Entertainment? Do you want to&nbsp;work with animals?&nbsp;Education?&nbsp;Gaming?</p> \r\n<p>You can start your own company, you can work for a small company, a big company, you can work for someone remotely on the other side of the planet. You can work in any industry, on anything you want. Your imagination is your only limiting factor.</p> \r\n<p><strong>Start Today</strong><br /> If I can impart any of my experience onto you, it would be to just START. Take some risks. Start today. Do you have an idea you are sitting on? Jot it down. Ask friends and family what they think of the idea. Lookup how to make a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), bring your idea to a women in tech group meetup.</p> \r\n<p>And don&rsquo;t think you have to come up with a huge idea. The work that I have been noted for is not the multi-million dollar software platforms or working with rockstars. It&rsquo;s the simple things, like the map we made for the LA tech scene, <a title=\"Represent.LA\" href=\"http://represent.la\">Represent.LA</a>.</p> \r\n<p>The start of the LA Makerspace was just a blog post asking if anyone else wanted to start a kid friendly hackerspace. Don&rsquo;t underestimate small, simple ideas because many times they can have the greatest impact. Look at Twitter!</p> \r\n<p><strong>Be Good to Yourself. Be Good to Each other</strong><br /> It&rsquo;s not us females vs them, males. At the end of the day, we just want to remove the stereotypes that have poisoned the industry for too long and remove the intimidation factor. We are init(together)!</p> \r\n<p>If you are in SoCal and want to connect with other women in tech, please <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/communities/105549705552197550450\" title=\"G+ SoCal Women
