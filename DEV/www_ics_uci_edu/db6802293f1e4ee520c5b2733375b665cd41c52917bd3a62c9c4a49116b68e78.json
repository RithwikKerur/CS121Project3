The area of a polyiamond is the number of cells it contains.\nThe growth constant of polyiamonds, $\\lambda_T$, is the limit of the\nratio between the number of polyiamonds of area n+1 and the number of\npolyiamonds of area n, as n tends to infinity.  In this talk I will show\nimproved lower and upper bounds on $\\lambda_T$, proving that it is\nbetween 2.8424 and 3.6050.\n\n<p>\nJoint work with Mira Shalah and Yufei Zheng (both from Technion, Israel).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<b>Short bio sketch:</b>\nGill Barequet is currently an Associate Professor and Vice Dean for\nCurriculum at the Faculty of Computer Science of the Technion (Israel\nInstitute of Technology) in Haifa, Israel.\nHe received his B.Sc. in Mathematics and Computer Science, and M.Sc.\nand Ph.D. in Computer Science from Tel Aviv University in 1985, 1987,\nand 1994, respectively.\nHe later had a post-doctoral position at Johns Hopkins University in\n1996-98, and a visiting position at Tufts University in 2009-10.\nHis research interests include discrete and computational geometry,\ncombinatorics, and interpolation and reconstruction algorithms.\nHe holds five U.S. patents in related areas.\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
