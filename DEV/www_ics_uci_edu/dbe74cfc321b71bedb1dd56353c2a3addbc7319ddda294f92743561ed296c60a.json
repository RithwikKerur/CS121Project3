Process algebras \nprovide a useful theoretical framework for avoiding state explosion\nby applying reductions at intermediate steps in a compositional analysis \nof a large system. We report on an implementation and experience with a \ntool that uses algebraic structure to perform modular, hierarchical \nanalysis of systems described in an Ada-based PDL, and report on\napplication to a collection of well-known example problems. Although \nalgebraic properties are fundamental to the approach, basic algebraic \noperations are a small portion of the tool.  Pre-analysis of the scope \nstructure and communication topology of the system under test, and\ndata flow analysis and controlled symbolic expansion of source code \nare essential to avoiding state explosion in practice. \n\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 27 13:36:13 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
