A design for an IRS is proposed in which both\n    of these problems are alleviated.

Our algorithm searches a tree\n    in which each node represents a partial assignment of vertices in the\n    smaller graph to vertices in the larger graph.

By carefully balancing\n    the computational load and the contention for shared resources, our algorithm\n    achieves almost linear speedup in the processing rate of search tree\n    nodes. However, the speedup of isomorphism detection rate is poor when\n    looking for few isomorphisms, and good only when looking for many isomorphisms.\n    We present an analysis of why we believe this property is intrinsic to\n    algorithms that parallelize the tree search without parallelizing the\n    node computations.

An example of this dilemma occurs in a wide range of\n    problems that involve processing trees, wherein processors can be assigned\n    either to separate subtrees, or to parallelizing the work performed on\n    individual tree nodes. We explore the complexity of the trade-offs involved\n    in this decision by considering alternative parallelizations of combinatorial\n    search, examining the factors that determine the best-performing implementation\n    for this important class of problems. Using subgraph isomorphism as a\n    representative search problem, we show how the density of the solution\n    space, the number of solutions desired, the number of available processors,\n    and the underlying architecture all affect the choice of an efficient\n    parallelization. Our experiments, which span seven different shared-memory\n    multiprocessors and a wide range of input graphs, indicate that relative\n    performance depends on each of these factors. On some machines and for\n    some inputs, a sequential depth-first search of the solution space, applying\n    simple loop-level parallelism at each node in the search tree, performs\n    best. On other machines or other inputs, parallel tree search performs\n    best. In still other cases, a hybrid solution, containing both parallel\n    tree search and loop parallelism, works best.
