Whenever logical processes of\nthought are employed - that is, whenever thought for a time runs along\nan accepted groove - there is an opportunity for the machine.  Formal\nlogic used to be a keen instrument in the hands of the teacher in his\ntrying of students' souls.  It is readily possible to construct a\nmachine which will manipulate premises in accordance with formal\nlogic, simply by the clever use of relay circuits.  Put a set of\npremises into such a device and turn the crank, and it will readily\npass out conclusion after conclusion, all in accordance with logical\nlaw, and with no more slips than would be expected of a keyboard\nadding machine.\n\n<p>\n\nLogic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be\nwell to produce more assurance in its use.  The machines for higher\nanalysis have usually been equation solvers.  Ideas are beginning to\nappear for equation transformers, which will rearrange the\nrelationship expressed by an equation in accordance with strict and\nrather advanced logic.  Progress is inhibited by the exceedingly crude\nway in which mathematicians express their relationships.  They employ\na symbolism which grew like Topsy and has little consistency; a\nstrange fact in that most logical field.\n\n<p>\n\nA new symbolism, probably positional, must apparently precede the\nreduction of mathematical transformations to machine processes.  Then,\non beyond the strict logic of the mathematician, lies the application\nof logic in everyday affairs.  We may some day click off arguments on\na machine with the same assurance that we now enter sales on a cash\nregister.  But the machine of logic will not look like a cash\nregister, even a streamlined model.\n\n<p>\n\nSo much for the manipulation of ideas and their insertion into the\nrecord.  Thus far we seem to be worse off than before - for we can\nenormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can\nhardly consult it.  This is a much larger matter than merely the\nextraction of data for the purposes of scientific research; it\ninvolves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of\nacquired knowledge.  The prime action of use is selection, and here we\nare halting indeed.  There may be millions of fine thoughts, and the\naccount of the experience on which they are based, all encased within\nstone walls of acceptable architectural form; but if the scholar can\nget at only one a week by diligent search, his syntheses are not\nlikely to keep up with the current scene.\n\n<p>\n\nSelection, in this broad sense, is a stone <a\nhref=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?adz\">adze</a> in the\nhands of a cabinetmaker.  Yet, in a narrow sense and in other areas,\nsomething has already been done mechanically on selection.  The\npersonnel officer of a factory drops a stack of a few thousand\nemployee cards into a selecting machine, sets a code in accordance\nwith an established convention, and produces in a short time a list of\nall employees who live in Trenton and know Spanish.  Even such devices\nare much too slow when it comes, for example, to matching a set of\nfingerprints with one of five millions on file.  Selection devices of\nthis sort will soon be speeded up from their present rate of reviewing\ndata at a few hundred a minute.  By the use of photocells and\nmicrofilm they will survey items at the rate of thousands a second,\nand will print out duplicates of those selected.\n\n<p>\n\nThis process, however, is simple selection: it proceeds by examining\nin turn every one of a large set of items, and by picking out those\nwhich have certain specified characteristics.  There is another form\nof selection best illustrated by the automatic telephone exchange.\nYou dial a number and the machine selects and connects just one of a\nmillion possible stations.  It does not run over them all.  It pays\nattention only to a class given by a first digit, and so on; and thus\nproceeds rapidly and almost unerringly to the selected station.  It\nrequires a few seconds to make the selection, although the process\ncould be speeded up if increased speed were economically warranted.\nIf necessary, it could be made extremely fast by substituting\nthermionic-tube switching for mechanical switching, so that the full\nselection could be made in one-hundredth of a second.  No one would\nwish to spend the money necessary to make this change in the telephone\nsystem, but the general idea is applicable elsewhere.\n\n<p>\n\nTake the prosaic problem of the great department store.  Every time a\ncharge sale is made, there are a number of things to be done.. The\ninventory needs to be revised, the salesman needs to be given credit\nfor the sale, the general accounts need an entry, and, most important,\nthe customer needs to be charged.  A central records device has been\ndeveloped in which much of this work is done conveniently.  The\nsalesman places on a stand the customer's identification card, his own\ncard, and the card taken from the article sold - all punched cards.\nWhen he pulls a lever, contacts are made through the holes, machinery\nat a central point makes the necessary computations and entries, and\nthe proper receipt is printed for the salesman to pass to the\ncustomer.\n\n<p>\n\nBut there may be ten thousand charge customers doing business with the\nstore, and before the full operation can be completed someone has to\nselect the right card and insert it at the central office.  Now rapid\nselection can slide just the proper card into position in an instant\nor two, and return it afterward.  Another difficulty occurs, however.\nSomeone must read a total on the card, so that the machine can add its\ncomputed item to it.  Conceivably the cards might be of the dry\nphotography type I have described.  Existing totals could then be read\nby photocell, and the new total entered by an electron beam.\n\n<p>\n\nThe cards may be in miniature, so that they occupy little space.  They\nmust move quickly.  They need not be transferred far, but merely into\nposition so that the photocell and recorder can operate on them.\nPositional dots can enter the data.  At the end of the month a machine\ncan readily be made to read these and to print an ordinary bill.  With\ntube selection, in which no mechanical parts are involved in the\nswitches, little time need be occupied in bringing the correct card\ninto use - a second should suffice for the entire operation.  The\nwhole record on the card may be made by magnetic dots on a steel sheet\nif desired, instead of dots to be observed optically, following the\nscheme by which Poulsen long ago put speech on a magnetic wire.  This\nmethod has the advantage of simplicity and ease of erasure.  By using\nphotography, however, one can arrange to project the record in\nenlarged form, and at a distance by using the process common in\ntelevision equipment.\n\n<p>\n\nOne can consider rapid selection of this form, and distant projection\nfor other purposes.  To be able to key one sheet of a million before\nan operator in a second or two, with the possibility of then adding\nnotes thereto, is suggestive in many ways.  It might even be of use in\nlibraries, but that is another story.  At any rate, there are now some\ninteresting combinations possible.  One might, for example, speak to a\nmicrophone, in the manner described in connection with the\nspeech-controlled typewriter, and thus make his selections.  It would\ncertainly beat the usual file clerk.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Next:</b> <a href=\"section6.html\">Section 6</a>,\n<b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"section4.html\">Section 4</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
