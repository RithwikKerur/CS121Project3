It&#39;s a long one with many parts, some involving third parties\nand others involving unfamiliar software, so you&#39;ll need to start early\nand allow for the inevitable stumbling blocks.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Summary:</B>  Evaluate the usability of\na retail website chosen from the two alternatives below and propose a validated\nredesign of the site.  The alternatives are</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>The UCI Bookstore, <A HREF=\"http://www.book.uci.edu\">http://www.book.uci.edu</A></FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Levin&#39;s Shoes and Dry Goods, <A HREF=\"http://www.drygoodstore.com\">http://www.drygoodstore.com</A>\n, a clothing store</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>This assignment has three phases: Evaluate\nthe existing site, redesign the site to improve the shortcomings you identified\n(including user tests of the new design), and propose the new design to\nthe site management.  Be sure to read the entire assignment right away so\nyou&#39;re aware of everything that&#39;s involved.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>You will work on this assignment in groups\nof two or three.  We estimate that the increase in coordination and communication\nnecessary in a three-person group roughly equals the 17% decrease in individual\nworkload and we expect that the products of three-person groups will be\nat least as complete and thorough as the better results of two-person groups.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As in past assignments, when we give page\ncounts here we&#39;re referring to single-spaced text in 10- or 12-point\ntype with one-inch margins.  We encourage helpful illustrations, but illustrations\ndo not count towards the page limits.</FONT></P>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part I:  Evaluate the existing site</B>\n </FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Determine five typical tasks that a user might\nperform on the site (e.g., find the textbooks for a student&#39;s spring\nquarter classes, compare the laptop computers available for under $1500,\nfind the warmest set of long underwear for a ski trip).  Choose tasks that\nare realistic, broadly representative of what users might want to do on\nthe site, and substantial enough that the user can&#39;t complete them with\njust a few clicks in a minute or two.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Find two or three people who aren&#39;t enrolled\nin our class.  Have each person, one at a time, do a walkthrough of the\nsite, attempting to complete each of your five tasks.  Follow the walkthrough\nguidelines discussed in class and in the book:  Encourage the users to narrate\nwhat they&#39;re thinking and what problems or questions they&#39;re encountering.\n One team member should encourage the user to talk through the process (using\nnon-judgemental, non-leading prompts); the other(s) should observe and take\nnotes on the difficulties that come up.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Use the guidelines in the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kobsa/courses/ICS104/lit/Farkas&Farkas-TC.pdf\">Farkas &amp; Farkas paper</A>\n(which you read as part of the previous assignment) to categorize the usability\nproblems your users encountered.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Write a usability evaluation report of at\nleast two and at most four pages , describing very briefly what your evaluation\nprocess was and at more length what results you found, referring to the\nFarkas guidelines where applicable and documenting .  This will eventually\nbe an appendix to your redesign proposal, so you should write it with an\neye towards convincing the site management that you have made a thorough,\nmethodologically sound evaluation and that the flaws you identified are\nmore than just your personal opinion.  Of course you must also write in\na polite, professional tone; the site management won&#39;t take your advice\nif they feel it&#39;s nasty, sarcastic, or making fun of them.</FONT>\n<BR><BR>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Try to be comprehensive, addressing most of\nthe major flaws, even if that means overlooking minor issues or repeated\ninstances of the same problems.  (If a site includes many links that are\nhard to identify, for example, just say once something like, &quot;Many\nlinks, such as the &#39;Policies&#39; link on the home page, are hard to\nidentify as links because they&#39;re not distinguished from other content.\n Farkas guideline 1.1 says, &#39;Be sure that all links indicate that they\nare links.&#39; &quot;  Don&#39;t list every link that has a problem; that\nwill fill up the available space before you have time to cover most of the\nimportant issues.)  It&#39;s a good strategy to mention some successful\naspects of the site, since it will make your report sound less unremittingly\ncritical and thus more palatable to the site management, but your main goal\nis to propose a redesign so most of your report should address areas for\nimprovement.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part II:  Redesign the site</B></FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Develop a new design for the site, one that\nimproves the areas you identified in your usability evaluation.  Focus mainly\non global issues of navigation and usability; don&#39;t spend much of your\ntime polishing details like typefaces and graphics and the wording of the\ntext on the pages.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Build a prototype of your new design using\nthe Denim system you installed as part of the previous assignment.  Denim\nallows you to sketch pages and link tags and makes live links associated\nwith the tags.  (If you encounter major problems with Denim, let us know\nwell in advance; don&#39;t revert to pencil, paper, and sticky notes for\nyour prototype without getting our permission first.)</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Test your prototype informally on each other\nduring your design, making changes as necessary.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Find two or three people who aren&#39;t in\nthe class; they don&#39;t have to be the same people who you used before,\nbut they may be.  With each person, walk through your prototype, asking\nthe user to perform each of the original five tasks and any others that\nyou think are appropriate or necessary.  As always, follow the guidelines\nfor working with users. </FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>As flaws or improvements become apparent during\nyour user testing, adjust your design and prototype and re-test the changed\naspects.  Keep iterating until you are satisfied with your design.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4><B>Part III:  Propose your new design</B></FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Write a proposal of three to six pages describing\nyour redesign.  The major part of the proposal should describe the design\nand how it improves the usability issues you identified in Part I.  Of course\nyou will include illustrations as appropriate.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A smaller part of your proposal, not more\nthan a page out of the maximum of six, should describe your prototyping\nand evaluation process and what changes resulted from that user testing.\nWe&#39;re assuming here that the site management is interested in the process\nand how thorough a job you did.  This part might not always reflect reality;\nthe typical real-world proposal probably wouldn&#39;t describe the false\nstarts and intermediate steps towards the solution.  But in this case, include\nit.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Submit your proposal document via Checkmate.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Save your Denim prototype as a web document\n(using &quot;Export to Web&quot; under &quot;Save As...&quot;).  This produces\none HTML file and one folder of other files.  Collect the file and folder\ntogether into one archive (in .zip, .gz, .sit, or .tar format--ask a classmate\nor the TA how to do this if you don&#39;t know) and submit it via Checkmate.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>Submit your usability evaluation from Part\nI via Checkmate.</FONT></LI>\n<BR><BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>A realistic proposal would have a cover letter,\na single simple page in business letter format whose body would say something\nlike, &quot;Enclosed is our proposal for the redesign of your web site.\n We hope you find it useful and we look forward to hearing from you.&quot;\n But you do not have to write or submit a cover letter for this assignment.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>If you would like to ask the site management\nwhat their goals and requirements are, you may do that through the NoteBoard\nset up for this class at </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\">eee.uci.edu</FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>.\n Don&#39;t pester the actual management of the site; ask your questions\nthrough the NoteBoard and the instructor will respond as if he were the\nmanagement.  Everyone in the class may read the exchanges on the NoteBoard,\nsince requirements clarifications apply equally to everyone.  [Also, everyone\nshould use the EEE NoteBoard system because we might ask an exam question\nabout it and how it compares with newsgroups or other broadcast communications\nchannels.]  Questions on other aspects of the assignment may be asked in\nclass, in section, or by Email to </FONT><FONT FACE=\"Courier New\"><A HREF=\"mailto:ics104@uci.edu\">ics104@uci.edu</A></FONT><FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\" SIZE=4>In the interest of full disclosure, everyone\nshould know that Levin&#39;s Shoes and Dry Goods is owned by the instructor&#39;s\nbrother-in-law, Robert Levin  We included it here as a fresh alternative\nto the UCI Bookstore site, which presumably is already familiar to everyone,\nand as a site where students&#39; recommendations might be put into practice.\n If Mr. Levin chooses to redesign his site and incorporate your ideas, he\nmay give you credit on the site (which you could refer to on your r&eacute;sum&eacute;)\nbut he&#39;s under no obligation to compensate you in any other way.  If\nyou don&#39;t care for this arrangement, you have two alternatives:  First,\nyou may work on the UCI Bookstore site instead (which also has no obligation\nto use your ideas or compensate you).  Second, you may evaluate and redesign\ndrygoodstore.com but state clearly at the top of your proposal that you\ndo not wish your proposal sent to the owner.  In the latter case, your work\nwill still be graded on the same basis (which means that you still have\nto write it in the same polite, professional tone).</FONT></P>\n<BR><BR>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"Helvetica\" SIZE=1>Written by David G.
