Describe the sequence of\nall the recursive calls that would be performed by the pivoting version\nof the Bron&ndash;Kerbosch algorithm on this graph. For each call,\ndescribe the three sets given as arguments to the call, the pivot vertex\n$u$ chosen by the call, the list of vertices $v$ corresponding to the\nrecursive calls that this call makes, and any maximal clique that is\nproduced as output by the call.</p></li>\n<li><p>What are the degeneracy, $h$-index, and clustering coefficient of\nthe same graph $G$ given in the previous problem?</p></li>\n<li><p>Suppose that we are generating simulated social-network data by\nusing the Barabasi-Albert method, with parameter $k$: we start with a\n$k$-vertex clique and at each step add a new vertex connected to exactly\n$k$\nprevious vertices (chosen with probabilities in proportion to their\ndegrees). Suppose also that we do this for exactly $9k$ steps, so that we\nend up with a graph that has $10k$ vertices.\nDefine the diameter of a graph to be the largest unweighted distance\nbetween any two of its vertices. What is the smallest possible diameter\nof a graph that\ncan be generated in this way? Describe how a graph with this diameter\ncould be generated, and why no smaller diameter is possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use the MathSciNet collaboration distance calculator to find five\nmathematicians, whose collaboration distances from Paul Erd&ouml;s are\nrespectively 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. To find the distance for an author: go\nto the <a href=\"http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/searchauthors.html\">author\nsearch</a> feature of MathSciNet (from a UCI IP address, so that you\nwill be given subscription access to the database), enter the name of a\nmathematician, click on the \"Collaboration Distance\" link in the results\npage, hit the \"use Erd&ouml;s\" button in the collaboration distance\npage, and hit the search button. What is the shortest path from each of\nyour mathematicians to Erd&ouml;s? What is the largest collaboration\ndistance you can find in this way?</p></li>\n</ol></body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
