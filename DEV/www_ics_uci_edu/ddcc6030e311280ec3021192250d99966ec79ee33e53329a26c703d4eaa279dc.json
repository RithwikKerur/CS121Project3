Goodrich\n</h2>\n\n<p>\nThe problem of finding an electric vehicle route that optimizes both\ndriving time and energy consumption can be modeled as a bicriterion\npath problem. Unfortunately, the problem of finding optimal bicriterion\npaths is NP-complete. This paper studies such problems restricted to\ntwo-phase paths, which correspond to a common way people drive electric\nvehicles, where a driver uses one driving style (say, minimizing\ndriving time) at the beginning of a route and another driving style\n(say, minimizing energy consumption) at the end. We provide efficient\npolynomial-time algorithms for finding optimal two-phase paths in\nbicriterion networks, and we empirically verify the effectiveness of\nthese algorithms for finding good electric vehicle driving routes in\nthe road networks of various U.S. states. In addition, we show how to\nincorporate charging stations into these algorithms, in spite of the\ncomputational challenges introduced by the negative energy consumption\nof such network vertices.\n</p>\n<p>(Joint work with Pawe&#322; Pszona, to appear at ACM SIGSPATIAL 2014.)\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
