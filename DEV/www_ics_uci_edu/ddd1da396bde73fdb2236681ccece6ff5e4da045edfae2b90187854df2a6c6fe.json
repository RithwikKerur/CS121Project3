Does this mean they're new?\n\nThe families are:\n\n(A) x=1, y=2k, z=2k^2, w=2k^2=1 (formed by m=q=k, n=1, p=0)\n    for which the first few examples are (1,2,2,3) (1,4,8,9) (1,6,18,19).\n    I've drawn an example of the dissection for (1,8,32,33)\n    in <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/1-8-32-33.ps.gz\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/1-8-32-33.ps.gz</A>\n    which I hope makes the general construction clear.\n\n(B) x=(k+1)^2, y=2k^2, z=2k(k+1), w=2k^2+(k+1)^2 (formed by n-1=m=q=k, p=0)\n    for which the first few examples are (2,1,2,3) (9,8,12,17) (8,9,12,17).\n    I've drawn an example of the dissection for (25,32,40,57)\n    in <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/25-32-40-57.ps.gz\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/25-32-40-57.ps.gz</A>\n    which I hope makes the general construction clear.\n\nBoth of these have w=x+y or w=x+z, like your two square-sum classes.\nMaybe all square-sum classes have five piece dissections?

If you translate the statements that the two\nstaircases in the figure work into equations, you get something of the\nform 2(y-x)^2 - (2x-1)^2 = 1.\n\n    It's interesting that this seems to be a very sparse class\n    in comparison to the others.\n\nYes, exponentially sparse.  Probably the members of the family can be\nexpressed in a closed form involving powers of (I think) 3+-2sqrt(2),\nbut I didn't work through the generating function stuff to check this.\n\nNote that you can also get an interesting family of Pythagorean triples\nfrom the same sequence of approximations to sqrt(2):\n3^2+4^2=5^2, 20^2+21^2=29^2, 119^2+120^2=169^2...\nIn general these have the form x^2+(x+1)^2=z^2.  I've been trying\nunsuccessfully to find a four-piece dissection for 20^2+21^2=29^2, in\nthe hope that it would extend to the whole family.\n\nI'm also still stuck trying to find a dissection for 2^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 =\n15^2, which I think is the only one with w&lt;20 not covered by the families in\nyour book. This seems to be part of another family (x,y,y+1,w) related\nto the same Pellian -- the next members of which seem to be (12,59,60,85)\nand (12,348,349,493) -- y, z, and w are formed by halving the numbers\nfrom the Pythagorean triples above but I don't yet understand the x's.\n\n-d\n</PRE>\n<HR><PRE>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: more triple-to-one squares \n<B>Date:</B>           Mon, 15 Dec 1997 16:00:29 -0500\n<B>From:</B>           Greg Frederickson &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:gnf@cs.purdue.edu\">gnf@cs.purdue.edu</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n&gt;  Note that you can also get an interesting family of Pythagorean triples\n&gt;  from the same sequence of approximations to sqrt(2):\n&gt;  3^2+4^2=5^2, 20^2+21^2=29^2, 119^2+120^2=169^2...\n&gt;  In general these have the form x^2+(x+1)^2=z^2.
