In this day and age, it is extremely important for \ncommunication and information transfer to be as efficient and as cheap \nas possible.  Vannevar Bush's <A \nHREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/VBush.html.Z\">As We May Think</A> \ndescribes the importance of highly-accessible information and communication.
