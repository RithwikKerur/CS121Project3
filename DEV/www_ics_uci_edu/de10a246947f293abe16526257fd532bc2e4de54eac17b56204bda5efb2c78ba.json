It can be seen as being between\nserver-based systems and pure peer-to-peer systems. The supervisor\nonly has to store a constant amount of information about the\nsystem at any time and only needs to send a small constant number\nof messages to integrate or remove a peer in a constant amount of\ntime. Therefore it shares the benefits of server-based and pure\npeer-to-peer systems without inheriting their disadvantages.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
