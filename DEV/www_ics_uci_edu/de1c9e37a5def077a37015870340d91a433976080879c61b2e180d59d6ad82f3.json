It is an N-shape, with vertices one unit along the length-3 \nside, 1.5 units along the long side, at the obtuse vertex, and 3 units along \nthe long side.  (Image attached.)\n\nI found this by systematically going through all ways of making an N shape in \nthe triangle, with one vertex of the N at a triangle vertex.  One way gave my \nprevious solution, four of them led to the four folds I showed you in my \nprevious message (all with more than three folds), and the sixth led to this \nsolution.\n\nBy the way, there are also three infinite families of tetrahedra that can be \nfolded from the triangle. if you fold two of the triangle edges in half, so \nthat all three vertices meet at a point, you get a shape with one remaining \nedge (forming a continuous loop) and two interior vertices at the midpoints \nof the original triangle. The other two tetrahedron vertices can be chosen to \nbe any two opposite points from the loop.  There is one solution in common to \nall three such families: the one I first sent you.  However, it seems that \nnone of these possibilities uses only three folds.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<a href=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</a> <a\nhref=\n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</a>\n</pre>\n\n<div align=\"center\"><img src=\"toshikato3.gif\" alt=\n\"second solution to 2-3-4 triangle folding puzzle\" width=\"433\"\nheight=\"158\"></div>\n\n&nbsp; \n\n<hr>\n<pre>\nDear Prof. Eppstein,\n\n&gt; On 10/30/00 11:54 PM +0900, Toshi Kato wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There's more than one three-fold tetrahedron?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, I think there is one more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok, I found it.

I don't know of any similar nice property for the remaining \ntriangle, EFC. This construction also makes it clear that the sharp angle of \nthe 2-3-4 triangle is twice that of a 1-sqrt(15)-4 right triangle, which is \nhelpful if you want to calculate the angles.\n-- \nDavid Eppstein       UC Irvine Dept. of Information &amp; Computer Science\n<a href=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</a> <a\nhref=\n\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/</a>\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
