Perhaps\nthe most well studied and applied version of the problem uses a distance\noracle, which can report the shortest path distance between any pair of\nnodes. We introduce and study the betweenness oracle, where bet(a, m, z) is\ntrue iff m lies on a shortest path between a and z. This oracle is strictly\nweaker than a distance oracle, in the sense that a betweenness query can be\nsimulated by a constant number of distance queries, but not vice versa.\nDespite this, we are able to develop betweenness reconstruction algorithms\nthat match the current state of the art for distance reconstruction, and even\nimprove it for certain types of graphs. We obtain the following algorithms:\n<ol>\n<li>\nReconstruction of general graphs in O(n^2) queries \n<li>\nReconstruction of\ndegree-bounded graphs in O\u02dc(n^3/2) queries \n<li>Reconstruction of geodetic\ndegree-bounded graphs in O\u02dc(n) queries \n</ol>\nIn addition to being a fundamental\ngraph theoretic problem with some natural applications, our new results shed\nlight on some avenues for progress in the distance reconstruction problem.\n\n<p>\nPaper by Mikkel Abrahamsen, Greg Bodwin, Eva Rotenberg, and\nMorten St\u00f6ckel\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
