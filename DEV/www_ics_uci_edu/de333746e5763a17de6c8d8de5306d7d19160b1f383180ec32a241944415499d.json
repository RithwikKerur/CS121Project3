Hadamard's Elementary Geometry</a> (vol 2).  It\nis closely related to the proof by\n<a href=\"ear.html\">ear decomposition</a>.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\nThe proof is by induction on the number of faces.  First of all, you\nremove one face and prove the formula V-E+F=1 for open polyhedral\nsurfaces. For a single face the formula obviously holds. Assume the\nformula holds for a smaller than F number of faces and consider a\nsurface with number of faces equal to F. Pick two vertices on the\nboundary (left by the removed face) of the surface and connect them by a\nchain of internal edges. (The existence of such a chain follows by a\nform of the Jordan curve theorem.) Now cut along this chain. You get two\nsurfaces for which the formula V-E+F=1 holds.  For the first let it be\nV1-E1+F1=1 and for the second V2-E2+F2=1.  Assume the chain contains L\nedges hence (L+1) vertices.  It then follows that E1+E2=E+L and\nV1+V2=V+L+1. Of course F1+F2=F.  Summing (algebraically) up gives the\ndesired result.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\n\nOne can also use a dual version of the proof, in which an open disk\n(initially formed by removing a vertex from the polyhedron) is\ndecomposed by finding alternating sequences of edges and faces.\n<P><HR><P>\n<a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Proofs of Euler's Formula</a>.<BR>\nFrom the <a href=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</a>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry pointers.<BR>\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</a>,\n<a href=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</a>.<P>\n<SMALL>Semi-automatically\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/filter.html\">filtered</a>\nfrom a common source file.\nLast update: <!--#flastmod file=\"euler.ff\" -->.</SMALL>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
