More\nimportant than this prediction is the reality that we are indeed\nseeing the increasing numbers of ubiquitous devices and accompanying\nsoftware infrastructures and protocols. Examples include mobile\ndevices such as phones, palm tops, and wrist bands; intelligent homes\nand home appliances such as stereos and stoves; and surveillance\nsystems such as found in subways and stores.</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of this seminar is to explore this emerging technology\nfrom its many aspects but always maintaining the viewpoint or a focus on\nthe human end users. There are many issues that may be discussed\nincluding: realistic scenarios; theories to help assess these\ntechnologies and develop appropriate requirements; software\ndevelopment platforms and toolkits; security and privacy; and\nunderlying protocols.</p>\n\n<p>The format of this class is that of a seminar. Materials for the class include product descriptions (software, middleware, or hardware), Web sites, research articles, and potentially guest speakers. Class participation,\nincluding attendance, is extremely important (40% of the\ngrade). Moreover, each student will do a presentation to the class on a\nrelated class topic, such as those mentioned above (20% of the grade). Finally, students will work on an individual or group project (depending on the size of the class) to be documented in a final report and in a final presentation.</p>\n\n<h3>References Mentioned Above</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Mark Wieser, Scientific American, September 1991, V. 265, N. 3, pp. 66-75.</li>\n<li>Mark Weiser, CACM, July 1993, V. 36, N. 7, pp. 75-84.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Interest in Future Computing Scenarios, Networking, and Mobile Computing, from the end users' perspective</li>\n  <li>Background in CS and programming experience</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Grading</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>40% Class Participation</li>\n  <li>20% Class Presentation</li>\n  <li>40% Term Project</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<hr>\n\n</a><a HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
