In the\nweighted version of the problem, we find contact representations with the\nadditional restriction that the areas for the polygons or the volumes for the\npolyhedra realize some pre-specified value for the vertices. We address\ndifferent variants of the problem depending on the types of polygons or\npolyhedra (convex or non-convex, axis-aligned or not), types of contacts\n(proper contacts with common boundaries of non-zero lengths in 2D or non-zero\nareas in 3D or improper contacts where common boundaries of zero lengths or\nareas are allowed), and whether holes are allowed in the representation or\nnot.\n\n<p>\nIn the plane we mainly focus on the weighted version of the problem. We find\noptimal (in terms of polygonal complexity) contact representations for planar\ngraphs (both for axis-aligned and non-axis-aligned polygons) and some\nsubclasses of planar graphs. With non-axis-aligned polygons we show that\nnon-convex polygons with 4 sides are sometimes necessary and always\nsufficient for proportional contact representation of a planar graph, when\npoint contacts are allowed; otherwise for proper contacts, 7-sided polygons\nare sometimes necessary and always sufficient. We give a linear-time\nalgorithm in each case to compute the optimal representation. We also give\npolynomial-time algorithms to construct optimal proportional contact\nrepresentations for (2, 0)-sparse graphs and for maximal outerplanar graphs.\nIn case only axis-aligned polygons are used, we show that 8 sides are\nsometimes necessary and always sufficient for a planar graph. While we do not\nhave a polynomial-time algorithm to construct such a representation, we give\na linear-time algorithm to compute representation with 10-sided axis-aligned\npolygons. We also give linear-time construction algorithms for optimal\nproportional contact representations with 8-sided polygons for planar 3-trees\nand Hamiltonian maximal planar graphs, and with rectangles for maximal\nouterplanar graphs. For contact representation with 3D polyhedra, we consider\nboth the weighted and the unweighted variants of the problem for both planar\nand non-planar graphs and have some preliminary results. We find several\nsubclasses of planar graphs that have contact representations using cubes or\nproportional boxes. We also consider (improper) contact representations using\ntetrahedra, and show that planar graphs, complete bipartite and tripartite\ngraphs, and complete graphs with at most 10 vertices have such\nrepresentations.\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
