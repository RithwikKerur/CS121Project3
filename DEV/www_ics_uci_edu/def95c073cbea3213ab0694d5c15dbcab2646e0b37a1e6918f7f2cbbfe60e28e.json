In case that wasn't\nclear, suppose I have a set of points randomly scattered over the plane,\nand a rectangular window of some fixed size, and I want to get each point\nvisible inside the window at least once.  I move the window some number of\ntimes, and that number will of course be between 0 (if all the points fit in\none view) and the number of points (if they're all far apart).  Moving the\nwindow is expensive, so what I want is an algorithm to determine the smallest\nset of window positions that covers all the points.  The algorithm should\nprobably be quadratic in the number of points or better - optimality is\nless important.  Algorithms, references and reductions to similar problems\nare all welcome...\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstan shebs\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<A HREF=\"mailto:shebs@cs.utah.edu\">shebs@cs.utah.edu</A>\n\n(Incidentally, this problem arose in connection with my recently posted\ngame \"xconq\", where the points are playing pieces and the window is an\nX window, so a good algorithm will likely show up in the next release!)\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
