We assume that the unknown graph G is connected, unweighted, and has bounded degree. In the reconstruction problem, the goal is to find the graph G. In the verification problem, we are given a hypothetical graph \u011c and want to check whether G is equal to \u011c.\nWe provide a randomized algorithm for reconstruction using \u00d5(n^{3/2}) distance queries, based on Voronoi cell decomposition. Next, we analyze natural greedy algorithms for reconstruction using a shortest path oracle and also for verification using either oracle, and show that their query complexity is n^{1+o(1)}. We further improve the query complexity when the graph is chordal or outerplanar. Finally, we show some lower bounds, and consider an approximate version of the reconstruction problem.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nPaper by Sampath Kannan, Claire Mathieu and Hang Zhou [TALG 18]\n<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3199606\">\nhttps://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3199606</a>\n</p>\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
