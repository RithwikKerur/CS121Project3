Suppose that we create a binary tree on n items by inserting the\nitems one at a time, with each permutation of the items equally likely,\nand each new item inserted at a leaf of the tree. Are all distinct\nbinary trees equally likely to be generated by this process? Why or why\nnot?\n\n2. For which values of alpha would the trees used for the binary heap\ndata structure be alpha-balanced, in the sense used for BB[alpha] trees?\nThat is, for which alpha is it always the case that, in any binary heap,\nany node has at least alpha times as many descendants as its parent?\n\n3. (CLRS 13.2-4): Show that any arbitrary n-node binary search tree can\nbe transformed into any other arbitrary n-node binary search tree using\nO(n) rotations. (Hint: first show that at most n-1 right rotations\nsuffice to transform the tree into a right-going chain.)\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
