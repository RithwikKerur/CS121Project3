If any two circles E and F (green) are tangent to \neach other, with E and F both tangent to both of A and B, then the \ntangency between E and F lies on one of C or D.  Further, if (say) the \ntangency lies on C, then C is perpendicular to both E and F.\n\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER>\n<applet code     = \"de.cinderella.CindyApplet\"\n        archive = \"cindyrun.jar\"\n        width    = 630\n        height   = 350>\n<param  name=kernelID  value=\"931025086690\">\n<param  name=viewport value=\"de.cinderella.ports.EuclideanPort\">\n<param  name=filename value=\"bisector.cdy\">\n<param  name=polar value= \"false\">\n<param  name=width value= \"630\">\n<param  name=height value=\"350\">\n<param  name=doublebuffer value= \"true\">\n<param  name=mesh value=\"false\">\n<param  name=axes value=\"false\">\n<param  name=snap value=\"false\">\n<param  name=scale value=\"25.0\">\n<param  name=originx value=\"210\">\n<param  name=originy value= \"233\">\n<param  name=deltafactor value= \"0\">\n<param  name=pref0 value=\"cinderella.defaults.background=255,255,255\">\n<IMG SRC=\"bisector.gif\" WIDTH=631 HEIGHT=353\nALT=\"Circular angle bisectors\"><BR>\n<SMALL>If you were running Java, you'd see a nice animation instead of this \ngif.</SMALL>\n</applet>\n</DIV>\n\n<P>As usual, this can be proven easily by\n<A HREF=\"inversion.html\">inversion</A>: just invert by a \ncircle centered on one of the crossing points of A and B, so that A and B \nare transformed to two crossing lines, and C and D are transformed to the \ntwo angle bisectors of those lines.\n\n<P>Note that the angle bisectors, and their property of containing the \ntangents of pairs of disks tangent to each other and to A and B, continue \nto exist even when A and B do not cross, even though in this case there is \nno longer any angle to bisect.  In this case, the existence of these \ncircles is again seen by inversion, to a configuration in which A and B are \nconcentric. The existence of these bisectors is especially useful for \nconstructing instances of <A HREF=\"steiner.html\">Steiner's porism</A>, \nrings of tangent circles between two circles, since it gives a point on \neach successive tangent circle from the previous one.\n\n<P>If we are given any point x on C (or D), we can construct the tangent \ncircles E and F using the <A HREF=\"four-circles.html\">four-circle \nproperty</A>: the four circles A, E, the line L through x and the center \nof C (viewed as an infinite-radius circle), and a circle along the line \nperpendicular to L through the center of A together form a cycle of four \ntangent circles, three tangencies of which are known or easily \nconstructed.  The fourth tangency, of A with E, is then the point where \nthe circle through these three tangencies crosses A.  Once we have \nsimilarly constructed the tangency of B with E, we have three points on E \nfrom which the circle itself is easily found.\n\n<P><HR><P>\nAnimation created by <A HREF=\"http://www.cinderella.de/\">Cinderella</A>.<BR>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"bisector.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
