Then mount the floppy using the commands:\n<br>\nmount  /mnt/floppy\n<br>\nThis command will mount a floppy disk under the directory: /mnt. Then use /mnt/f\nloppy to refer to your floppy, e.g.:\n<br>\nls /mnt/floppy\n<br>\nTo manipulate the files in the floppy disk, use the same Unix commands as usual\n(e.g. to copy a file into the floppy disk,\n<br>\ncp file_name    /mnt/floppy\n<br>\nWhen you are done, you need to un mount the floppy using the following command:\n<br>\numount  /mnt/floppy\n<br>\nThis will un mount the floppy. If you eject before un mounting you will crash the machine!\n</LI>\n</UL>\n<br>\n\n<H3>Announcement 1: 9/24/01</H3>\n\n<UL>\nWelcome to ICS 243B. I hope you enjoy this course and learn alot! If you have any problems please feel free to come and talk to me. If my office hours are not convenient to meet then send me an email to schedule a time that you are available.

If you follow the link you will get the updated notes. Note one important change:\nhttp://www.tcpip-lab.net/links/man.cgi was changed to:\nhttp://www.tcpip-lab.net/links/manual.html  <br>\nAlso, Part 1 exercise 2, the cross over cables are not working with all the \nPC interface cards. So please skip the cross over cable exercise and just \nconnect all hosts using the hub  only.\n\n</UL>\n\n<H3>Announcement 4: </H3>\n\n<UL>\nI just wanted to inform you of the following schedule so that you can plan your\nquarter accordingly:\n\n<LI>Sept 24th Week 1: Intro, lab due Oct 1st\n<LI>Oct 1st, Week 2: Single Segment Networks, lab due Oct 8th\n<LI>Oct 8th, Week 3: Multi Segment Networks (1/2), lab due Oct 15th\n<LI>Oct 15th, Week 4: Multi Segment Networks (2/2), lab due Oct 22nd\n<LI>Oct 22nd, Week 5: Dynamic Routing, lab due Nov 5th\n<LI>Oct 29th, Week 6: Midterm (covers lab 1,2, and 3 only)\n<LI>Nov 5th, Week 7: Link Layer Switching, lab due Nov 19th\n<LI>Nov 12th, Week 8: day off\n<LI>Nov 19th, Week 9: Transport Layer, lab due Nov 26th\n<LI>Nov 26th, Week 10: Review\n<LI>Dec 3rd, Finals week: Final (covers lab 1,2,3,4,5,6)\n</LI>\n<br>\nVeterans day is on Nov 11th and we have the 12th off.

Please report any other h/w problems to myself and\nKoji.\n<br>\nYou also need to use one of the available editors: vi, emacs, pico or kedit to\nopen files on the PCs for copying and pasting.\n<br>\nCopying files to your floppy, note that you need to specify the drive name - a:\n<br>\ne.g. mcopy sourcefile a:newfile\n<br>\n</UL>\n<H3>Announcement 5: 9/28/01 </H3>\n\n<UL>\nThe notes for lab2 are on the web and a copy was given to the engineering copy c\nenter.\n<br>\nPlease skip Exercise\n5 Lab Report question #3. I have not covered that and should have removed it fro\nm the notes. Sorry for that. If you have included it that is OK, I will accept w\nhatever anwers you provided.\n<br>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n\n<H3>Announcement 6: 10/2/01 </H3>\n\nThere were some errors with URLs in prelab and I clarified some exercises based\non feedback I got from some of your colleagues. Had mostly to do with resetting\nthe interfaces at the end of the exercises when IP addresses/netmasks were chang\ned during the exercise. Also, in exercise 9, for the lab report, the login and p\nasswd are in different packets not in the same packet. The sentence in the lab r\neport is not clear on that.\n<br>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n\n<H3>Announcement 7: 10/3/01 </H3>\n\nI placed a handout version of the lecture notes on the website. Please go to the bottom of the outline page to find the URL for the handouts. 6 slides per page.\n<br>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n\n<H3>Announcement 8: 10/8/01 </H3>\n\n<LI> You only need to do part 1 of lab3 this week. The lab report is required bu\nt the prelab is optional this week. You will have to hand the prelab in the foll\nowing week if you do not get it in this week. In otherwords, we need to get a Pr\ne Lab for lab 3 from you, attach it to either this week's lab report (part 1) or\n next week's lab report (parts 2-5).\n<LI> Please include only the necessary output, do not print (ie save) \"Details\"\nfor your Ethereal output if not needed. Only include parts of the output in your\n report that are relevant to the questions that are being asked, and if it is sa\nys include output make sure you have captured only what is needed and not more.\n\n<LI> For lab 2 we will ignore this since I did not specify it more clearly, but\nfor the remaining labs I will ask the graders to penalize excessive output.\n<LI> From now on, new announcements will be placed at the top of this page.\n</LI>\n<br>\n</UL>\n<UL>\n<BR>\n<BR>\n</UL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
