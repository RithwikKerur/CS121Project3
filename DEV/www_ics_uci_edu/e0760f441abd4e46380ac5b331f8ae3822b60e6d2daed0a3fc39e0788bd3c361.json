You should submit it for publication.\n\nActually, it is a special case of a much more general result. Suppose\nthat N has a set of distinct divisors d[1]..d[k] whose sum is divisible\nby N. Suppose that for some x the numbers p[i] = x*N*d[i]+1 are all\nprime. Let A be the product of the p[i]. Then A is a Carmichael number.\nIt is easy to show that A-1 is divisible by x*N^2, and that x*N^2 is\ndivisible by x*N*d[i] = p[i]-1 for all i, thus the necessary conditions\nare satisfied.\n\nFor example, 20 = 1+4+5+10, thus if 20x+1, 80x+1, 100x+1 and 200x+1 are\nall prime, then their product is a Carmichael number. This is the case\nfor x=333 and x=741.\n\nIt is relatively easy to find such partitions of N. If rN =\nd[1]+...+d[k], then dividing by N we get r = 1/e[1]+...+1/e[k], where\ne[i] = N/d[i]. Thus, every Egyptian fraction representation of the\ninteger r will lead to a partition of the desired type. The example\nabove is derived from 1 = 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/20.\n\nNote that if the set of divisors d[1]..d[k] does not include N itself,\nthen we can always append d[k+1] = N to the set. Thus, for example, not\nonly is (6x+1)(12x+1)(18x+1) a Carmichael number whenever the three\nfactors are prime, but also (6x+1)(12x+1)(18x+1)(36x+1) is a Carmichael\nnumber if in addition 36x+1 is prime. For example, both 7*13*19 and\n7*13*19*37 are Carmichael numbers.\n\nAn interesting possibility is the following. There are numbers N for\nwhich there are two (or more) distinct sets of divisors whose sums are\ndivisible by N. (By distinct, I mean having no elements in common.) For\nexample, 120 = 20+40+60 = 1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+24+30. If we can find\nan x such that the corresponding p[i] are all prime, then we will have\nfound a Carmichael number which is the product of two smaller Carmichael\nnumbers. Another possibility (with fewer divisors) is 360 = 60+120+180 =\n5+12+36+40+45+60+72+90.\n\nRegards,\n\nBill\n\nSent via Deja.com\n<A HREF=\"http://www.deja.com/\">http://www.deja.com/</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           Bill Daly &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:bill.daly@tradition-ny.com\">bill.daly@tradition-ny.com</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Perfect numbers and Carmichael numbers - a hidden relation\n<B>Date:</B>           Thu, 25 Jan 2001 18:02:37 -0800\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn article &lt;94pvi9$7k$1@nnrp1.deja.com&gt;,\n  Bill Daly &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:bill.daly@tradition-ny.com\">bill.daly@tradition-ny.com</A>&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ...
