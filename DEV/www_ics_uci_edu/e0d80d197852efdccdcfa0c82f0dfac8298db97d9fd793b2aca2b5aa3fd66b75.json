First, galaxy has an \nunlimited amount of information from politics to computers to \nsports.  IO also found thye yahoo which also has a lot of \ninformation from various universities and oither schools of \nthought.\n<li> THe second intersting thing I found was the ability to log onto \nvarious television progams- such as the Late Night with David \nLetterman monologues.\n <li>The third aspect of the web that I found intersting was the \nhomepages that are developed for each individual piece of information.  \nAfter seeing what takes place in class to make a program, iI appreciate \nmore the information that is presented. #3. </ol>\n\n<A NAME=\"Questions\"><H2>Questions I can now answer</H2></a>\n<ol>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ1\">explain the process of cashe and why us it so important</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ2\">who is the governor of Texas and why is he so important</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ3\">what is markup language</A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ4\">who is the dean of social sciences and what is his background </A>\n<li><A HREF=\"#QQ5\">how can the Library of Congress help me do research for my political science classes</A>\n</ol>\n\n<HR>\n<OL>\n<LI><A NAME\"QQ1\"><B>explain the process of cashe and why us it so \nimportant</B></A><br> My answer is when one is working with several Web \ndocuments at once, and one wants to keep lookig at just one or two of \nthem, it takes too much time to find the document, make the connection, \nand then download the page.  This is where<a \nhref=\"http://galaxy.einet.net/cgi-bin/wais-html-multi\"> cache</a> is \nuseful.  Cache \nkeeps the last few documents in memory, reloads them instantly when one \nrequests it. <a \nhref=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Computers/World_Wide_Web/Caching/\"> \nMosaic</a> checks locally to see if it is there before sending \nthe HTTP to  requests it.  THis is very useful because one can run multiple \nwindows of the program while being able to browze at the same time,  and  \none does not have to separate all windows from each other.  \n... QQ1 <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><B>who is the governor of Texas and why is he so important</B></A><br>\nMy answer is Governor Bush.  The reasons why he is so important is \nbecause not only is he former President Bush's son, but he was also to \nbeat a major Texan, former governor, Ann Richardson.  She was known \nthroughout Texan, and she also received a major endorsement form Ross \nPerot.  As it is well known, Ross <a \nhref=\"gopher://gopher.tamu.edu/11/.dir/polsci.dir/\">Perot</a> \nwas a contender against President \nGeorge Bush in the last Presidential race.  Governor Bush has also \nshown that there are still political alignments going on at all times.  \nMaybe Governor Bush will be a future <a \nhref=\"gopher://ftp.std.com/11/nonprofits/ICRN/orgs/rnc\">Presidential</a> \n, or vice presidential contender.... \nQQ2 <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>what is markup language</B></A><br>\nMy answer is actually more <a \nhref=\"http://www.pcweek.ziff.com/~eamonn/crash_course.html\">simple \n</a>than I originally thought.  <a \nhref=\"http://gnn.com/cgi-bin/imagemap/HOME?72,96\">Mark up</a> \nis the act of inserting additional text into a document which is not \nusually visible to the reader nor is it part on the context.

I tried to look at many resources \nand what I found was the the world Wide Web has a number of <a \nhref=\"http://sunsite.unc.edu/govdocs.html\">resources</a> \nthat have direct information on the library of Congress, political \nelections and much more information.  For example, the first link that I \nfound was through<a href=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Government/\"> \nyahoo</a>- it is an index on the federal government \ninformation on the Internet, also a Comprehensive government resourse. \nguide<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 08, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
