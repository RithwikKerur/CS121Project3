Is\r\nthere\r\ninfo on the Langsams as well?  How are you related to the Langsam family?\r\nMy father was born in Harbourg, near Hamburg, Germany but grew up in\r\nBerlin.\r\nHis parents, however, were from small towns in Poland, the names of which I\r\nalways forget.  I have to ask my mother.  My dad passed away 10 years ago.\r\nHis Hebrew name was Usher Zelig, in German it was Sigmund Arnold and in\r\nAmerica he was known as Sydney.  His father was Moshe Langsam and his\r\nmother\r\nwas Ida (Treff) Langsam.  My dad was the eldest son if five children -\r\nRegina, Benny (Bernard), Goldie and Esther.\r\nIs this helpful?\r\nI don't know what you mean by \"what branch.\"\r\nWhere do you live?\r\n~ ~ Ida Langsam\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nISLPR@aol.com\r\nThursday December 9, 1999 12:36 PM\r\nTo:   Moishe Miller/PSG/Prudential\r\ncc:\r\nSubject:  Re: Langsam Family\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a message dated 12/9/99 12:34:12 PM Eastern Standard Time,\r\nmoishe@langsam.com writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;&lt; Was this your dad:\r\n SYDNEY LANGSAM\r\n Born:   7 Feb 1909\r\n Died: 16 Jan 1990, 33009 (Hallandale, Broward, FL)\r\n SSN: 089-26-5928 issued in   New York, 1951 >>\r\nYes - how did you know that?\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________\r\nFrom: ISLPR@aol.com \r\nDate: Thu, 13 Jan 2000 07:01:05 EST \r\nSubject: Re: The Langsam Family/2 \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\n\r\nPS:\r\nMy grandfather was named Moshe Shlomo Langsam - he came from Poland - either \r\nDuckla or Sanock.\r\n~ ~ Ida Langsam (ISLPR@aol.com) \r\n_______________________________________________________\r\nISLPR@aol.com\r\nFriday January 28, 2000 12:33 PM\r\nTo:   Moishe Miller/PSG/Prudential\r\ncc:\r\nSubject:  Re: Langsam Family/update #1\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a message dated 1/28/00 11:56:48 AM Eastern Standard Time,\r\nmoishe@langsam.com writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;&lt; With the info I have from you, your tree basically starts with Moshe\r\n Langsam, who fathered\r\n Sydney in 1909 (and then Regina, Benny (Bernard), Goldie and Esther). >>\r\nRegina was first, then Sydney (Sigmund Arnold, actually, or Usher Zelig in\r\nHebrew).  Esther is the youngest.  I have to find out if Benny was older\r\nthan\r\nGoldie.\r\nAs far as first cousins:\r\nRegina Langsam married Chaskel Goldberg, and had Malka, who is married to\r\nSy\r\nFinkel, and they have a daughter, Shelly Aviva, who is unmarried.\r\nBenny Langsam married Ilse (don't know her maiden name) and had two\r\ndaughters: Ida Joan (unmarried) and Marilyn Alice.  Marilyn is divorced\r\nfrom\r\nher first husband but uses her former married name Holof.  She is currently\r\nseparated from her second husband and ocassionally uses that last name\r\n(Silverberg).  No children.\r\nGoldie Langsam married Hyman Hollander and had two children.  Hyman passed\r\naway many years ago and Goldie is remarried to Sam (but I don't remember\r\nhis\r\nlast name, as she doesn't use it)  Her children are:\r\nSteven Hollander, married to Ann (don't know her maiden name).  They have\r\nthree sons: Chad, Jonathan and I've forgotten the name of the third son!\r\nNone are married.\r\nMarion Hollander married Sy Wezenter; they are divorced.  They have two\r\nchildren: Michelle and Jeffrey.  Neither is married.\r\nEsther Langsam married Kurt Blaut; they have one son, Milton, who is\r\nmarried\r\nto Suzie.

The\r\nstory, as I remember it from being told, is that when it was declared\r\nforbidden for Jews to own businesses, the brothers concocted a scheme.\r\nBenny\r\nwent to some government official and said he had to go back to Berlin to\r\nclose his father's business, and was given a two day pass.  Once in Berlin,\r\nhe went to the embassy of one of the Scandanavia governments.  Benny was a\r\nsoccor player in Berlin and somewhat known. He told the embassy official\r\nthat\r\nhis team was playing in whatever country that was, and he needed to join\r\nhis\r\nteam for a match.  He was given a short term visa and left.  Two days\r\nlater,\r\nmy father went to the Polish government official and said my brother never\r\nreturned, there must have been a problem, now I have to go to Berlin to\r\nclose\r\nmy father's business, and HE was given a pass.  Once back in Berlin, my\r\nfather went right to the embassy and said his brother was in that\r\nScandanavian country waiting for him  (I would have to ask the details of\r\nwhat country if my mom knows it) and could he get a visa to get there?  He\r\nwas given a visa, and the brothers met up at a designated place.  Then they\r\nfled from one Scandanavian country to another, just steps ahead of the\r\nNazis\r\nwho were on their trail.  They managed to get to Switzerland where the\r\ngovernment basically said they would not help them out, but would not send\r\nthem back, and both Sydney and Benny spent the war in Zurich, working for\r\nthe\r\nRed Cross under trying conditions, doing things like building roads and\r\nrailroads.\r\nMy mother was stuck in Berlin, with her mother.  My mother's younger sister\r\nand older brother had somehow gotten out to England and were there during\r\nthe\r\nwar, with my Uncle being in the RAF.  But since my mother was already\r\nmarried\r\nto my father, she did not/could not leave.  Her father (my grandfather\r\nChaim\r\nGoldberg) had also been declared a Polish citizen and sent back to Poland,\r\nso\r\nit was just my mom and her mother alone together.  They were wending their\r\nway across borders and were caught in Belgium, where they were put into a\r\nwork camp.  It was the barracks where the Nazi officers lived, and my\r\nmother\r\nwas a maid while my grandmother was a cook.  Because he was working with\r\nthe\r\nRed Cross, my father was able to keep track of my mother's whereabouts and\r\neven be in touch.  My mom has the postcards which he sent to her, with the\r\nsecrect codes between them and some censorship from the Nazis where words\r\nwere crossed out.\r\nAfter the war was over, my father was able to visit my mom a couple of\r\ntimes\r\nin Belgium, where she was living in a DP camp.  He was able to come to\r\nAmerica because his sister Goldie and her husband were already living here.\r\nRegina and her husband had emigrated to Palestine before the war, which is\r\nwhere their daughter Malka was born.\r\nGoldie and her husband Hymie moved to New York just before the war, so she\r\nwas able to sponsor my father after the war.\r\nBenny was with my father in Switzerland, and Esther - who was about 15 at\r\nthe\r\ntime - survived a concentration camp.\r\nMy father came to New York in about 1947, 48 and 4 months later sent for my\r\nmother.\r\nMy grandmother (my mother's mother, Bronia Blima Goldberg, nee Schmuckler)\r\nemigrated to Canada which is where her son had moved from England.  After a\r\nfew years there, she moved to New York as did my Aunt, my mother's sister\r\nFanny (Fay) Goldberg Gabbe.\r\nAnd I was born in New York in 1951.\r\nThere you go!\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nISLPR@aol.com\r\nMonday February 21, 2000 01:21 PM\r\nTo:   Moishe Miller/PSG/Prudential\r\ncc:\r\nSubject:  Re: Langsam Family\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHi - sorry it's taken this long to reply to you but it's not that easy to\r\nget\r\ninfo from the older members of the family.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only details I was able to get are as follows:\r\nMy paternal grandfather Moses Langsam was born March 15 in Sanok\r\nHis wife, Edis (Treff) Langsam was born December 30 or 31 in Dukla.\r\nBoth cities were then considered Galitzia, then Poland.\r\nMoses (Moshe) had at least one brother, but no one can remember his name or\r\nanything else about him.  His name might have been \"Bearish\" (don't know\r\nthe\r\ncorrect Yiddish spelling).\r\nAll my mom can remember is that when she was in the work camp in Belgium,\r\nshe\r\nmet a man who said he is \"mispocha\" of the Langsams from Koln (Germany).\r\nShe\r\nthinks pehaps this \"Bearish\" moved from Polan to Koln, got married and had\r\nchildren, and that is where this man came to be related.  But she never saw\r\nhim again and couldn't get any more info.\r\nDoes this help?\r\n~ ~ Ida Langsam\r\n________________________________________________________\r\nFrom: ISLPR@aol.com \r\nDate: Thu, 29 Jun 2000 12:13:14 EDT \r\nSubject: Re: Langsam Family \r\nTo: moishe@langsam.com \r\n\r\n\r\nIn a message dated 6/28/00 9:53:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time, \r\nmoishe@langsam.com writes:\r\n\r\n\r\n<< We had some family in Cologne, Germany.
