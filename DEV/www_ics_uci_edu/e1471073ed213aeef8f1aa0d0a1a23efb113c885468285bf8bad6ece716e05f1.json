Otherwise, late homework\n      will not be accepted.\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n<dt>Textbooks (not required) </dt>\n<ul>\n<li> Machine learning by Kevin P.

The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to me, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email <a href=\"mailto:team@piazza.com\">team@piazza.com</a>.\n<p>\nFind our class page at: <a href=\"https://piazza.com/uci/fall2019/cs184a/home\">https://piazza.com/uci/fall2019/cs184a/home</a>\n</dd>\n\n\n<dt>Academic Honesty</dt>\n<li>\nFor assignments you are allowed to discuss the assignments verbally with other class members, but you are not allowed to look at or to copy anyone else's written solutions or code. All problem solutions and code submitted must be material you have personally written during this quarter, except for any standard library or utility functions.\n<li>\nFor class projects all reports submitted must be written by you or members of your project team. Code generated for class projects can be a combination of code written by team members and publicly-available code. You should clearly indicate in your reports and in your code documentation which parts of your code was written by you or your team and which parts of your code was written by others.\n<li>Academic honesty is a requirement for passing this class.  Any student who compromises the academic integrity of this course is subject to a failing grade. The work you submit must be your own. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to copying answers from another student, allowing another student to copy your answers, communicating exam answers to other students during an exam, attempting to use notes or other aids during an exam, or tampering with an exam after it has been corrected and then returning it for more credit.  If you do so, you will be in violation of the UCI Policies on Academic Honesty (see <a href=\"https://aisc.uci.edu/\">link</a>). It is your responsibility to read and understand these policies. Note that any instance of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Academic Integrity Administrative Office for disciplinary action and may be cause for a failing grade in the course.\n</p>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
