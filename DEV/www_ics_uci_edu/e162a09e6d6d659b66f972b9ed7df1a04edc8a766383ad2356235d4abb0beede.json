EEE (the Electronic Educational Environment) was built at UCI over 20 years ago and enhaced many times since then. The campus recently determined that it couldn't support bringing EEE fully up to date (both in terms of infrastructure and functionality) and decided to replace it with the commercial product Canvas.
