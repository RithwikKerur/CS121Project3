After all, most\n&gt; servers don't even have versions.\n\nI agree.  Perhaps a better way of describing _my_ motivation is\nthat I am attempting to develop standard techniques (I can't\nreally use the word methods here right now ;-)) for version\ncontrol and document management on the web.  Now, that's a very\nbig can of worms, all of whom are heading in different\ndirections, so step one is to standardise a way to refer to\nversion identifiers in URLs, thereby allowing servers to\nadvertise/export/make available (*) older revisions of pages.\n\nWhat I want to standardise, in the first step is \";version=opaque\nrevision id\".  No more, no less.  Once that's out of the way, we\ncan start talking about new methods for locking revisions,\nchecking in revisions, the semantics of the Content-Version HTTP\nheader, and so on.\n\n(*) Terminology question: what does one call it when a server\nfinds a URL acceptable and returns a page in response to a GET on\nthat URL?  Is the server exporting the page?  It's certainly not\nadvertising it, unless there's a link to it from the outside\nworld.\n\n&gt; Separate out the problem of\n&gt;   a) construct a URL for a previous version of a resource\n&gt;      given the current version of a resource and information\n&gt;      about the server's versioning system\n&gt;   b) determining from two URLs what their version relationship\n&gt;      might be.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think it's reasonable to use URL-decoration for (a) and not for (b).\n\nI agree entirely, given the caveat that the \"construction\" may\nnot, and probably is not, possible for the client, but almost\ncertainly is for the user.  That is, given a URL, a _general\npurpose_ client is not going to be able to create a versioned URL\nwith any hope of getting the \"right\" thing (of course a\nspecial-purpose client that knows what versioning software is\nrunning on the server can do better).  Humans on the other hand,\nknow exactly how versions work and can type into the \"go\" dialog\nexactly what they want.\n\n- David\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0025.html\">Daniel W.
