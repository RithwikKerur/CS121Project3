On this planet is a \nlifeform like no other. These life forms are known as human beings. For \nthousands of years these humans have been fascinated with the Heavens, \nand even entertained notions of space travel. The last part of this \ncentury has seen these fascinations become reality. However only in the \nlast three decades has it been possible for man to place his tools and \nhimself beyond Earth's atmosphere. Americas spacecraft have taken men to \nthe Moon, landed on Mars, and explored the region around<a \nhref=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-jupiter.html\"> \nJupiter's</a> moons. \nThey have also mapped Earth, and provide continous<a \nhref=\"http://thunder.atms.purdue.edu/\">meterological data</a> from Hawaii to \nMaine, and from Alaska to Florida.<p> \n<LI>     American spacecraft programs are separated into three \ncategories. \n<a href=\"http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/NASA_homepage.html\">NASA</a> managed \nprograms which are \nprimarily scientific in nature. Which include spacecraft such as the <a \nhref=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/viking.html\">Viking</a>,<a \nhref=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/voyager.html\"> Voyager</a>, \n<a href=\"http//nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/magellan.html\">Magellen</a>, \n<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/galileo.html\">Galileo</a> \nand<a href=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/mariner10.html\"> Mariner \n10</a> satelites used to probe Earth as well as other planets. \nNASA has also managed unmanned landings on the<a \nhref=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-moon.html\"> \nMoon</a>,<a \nhref=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/photogallery-venus.html\"> \nVenus</a>, and<a \nhref=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/photo_gallery/PhotoGallery-Mars.html\"> \nMars</a> as \nwell as the many manned trips to the Moon in the<a \nhref=\"http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo.html\">Apollo lunar \nlandings.</a> \n<LI>The second type of program is that of commercial spacecraft. Which \nfor \nthe most part are designed and built by private manufacturers. For \nexample the RCA company built and launched it's own satelite system \ncalled SATCOM. Another large company that takes advantage of space age \ntechnology is AT&T. They use the HS376 satelite made by the<a \nhref=\"http://info.stx.com/\"> Hughes</a> \naircraft company. This particular satelite is a good example of a \nsuccesful commercial aircraft. Hughes has built and marketed 30 of theses \naircraft to companies located around the globe.\n    <LI> The third type of spacecraft are military spacecraft, like NASA \nmany \nof the militaries aircraft have been built by private customers. There has \nalways been intense competition between the United States military \nservices, but that has been replaced by cooperation between forces. The \nAir Force conducts the majority of Department of Defense launches \nincluding those of Navy Spacecraft. The Air Force manages the NAVSTAR \nGlobal Positioning satelite, but all of the armed forces use it.<p>\n <LI>American spacecraft are launched from three sites within the \nUnited \nStates. These are the<a href=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/\"> Kennedy Space \nCenter</a> at Cape Canaveral, Florida. \n<a href=\"http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/gsfc/about/about_gsfc.html\">Wallops Flight \nFacility</a> at Wallops Island, Virginia. The last would be \nVandenberg Air Force Base in California. Kennedy Space Center is \nresponsible for the launches of all the planetary probes, and also all of \nthe manned space flights.<p>\n<LI> Officially known as the Space Transportation System, the<a \nhref=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_overview.html#sts_program\"> \nspace shuttle</a> is the most important earth-orbit program ever undertaken by the \nUnited States. The space shuttle can be used to perform scientific \nexperiments, carry satelites and place them into orbit, it can be used to \nretrieve satelites and repair them in space. The shuttle can carry both \ncivilian and military payloads. The basic idea of having a space shuttle \nsolely rests on the concept of a reusable spacecraft. The shuttle orbiter is\nbasically the largest spacecraft ever put into orbit, \nIt posed no small problem for designers. It would have to be launched \nlike a rocket, orbit like a spacecraft and return to Earth like an airplane. \nThe designers final result was the space shuttle. There were six \nspace shuttles built in all, The<a\nhref=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/PhotoServer/STS/ECN-8607.jpg\">\nEnterprise</a>,<a    \nhref=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/PhotoServer/STS/EC89-0055-2.jpg\">  \nDiscovery</a>,<a\nhref=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/PhotoServer/STS/EC91-221-7.jpg\">\nEndeavor</a>,<a\nhref=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/PhotoServer/STS/EC88-0247-1.jpg\">\nAtlantis</a>, <a   \nhref=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/PhotoServer/STS/EC94-42853-4.jpg\">\nColumbia</a> and<a \nhref=\"http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/PhotoServer/STS/EC82-21135.jpg\"> Challenger</a>\n<p>\nFor other information about NASA spacecraft click<a \nhref=\"http://www.ksc.nasa.gov/history/history.html\"> here</a>\n\n\n\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
