Millman, Jack Snoeyink \n</h2>\n\n<p>\nAbstract: Geometric algorithms use numerical computations to perform \ngeometric tests, so correct algorithms may produce erroneous results \nif insufficient arithmetic precision is available. Liotta, Preparata, \nand Tamassia, in 1999, suggested that algorithm design, which traditionally \nconsiders running time and memory space, could also consider precision \nas a resource. They demonstrated that the Voronoi diagram of n sites on \na U x U grid could be rounded to answer nearest neighbor queries on \nthe same grid using only double precision. They still had to compute \nthe Voronoi diagram before rounding, which requires the quadruple-precision \nInCircle test. We develop a \n\"degree-2 Voronoi diagram\" that can be computed using only double \nprecision by a randomized incremental construction in O(n log n log U) \nexpected time and O(n) expected space. Our diagram also answers nearest \nneighbor queries, even though \nit doesn't even use sufficient precision to determine a \nDelaunay triangulation. \n</p>\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
