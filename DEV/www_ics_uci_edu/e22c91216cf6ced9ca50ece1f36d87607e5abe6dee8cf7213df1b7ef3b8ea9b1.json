They will be coded by your student ID and you\nwill have to enter that ID in order to see your scores.\nYou will not be able to look at the scores of people whose\nstudent ID you do not know and this service will be available\nonly from systems on the UCI network.\n\nOn the other hand, anyone with access to a system at UCI who\nknows your student ID will be able to see your scores in the course.\nThis is an extension of the common practice on campus of posting listings\nof scores by student ID, except that here the listing is on the\nnetwork (more people can see them than on a wall) and someone\nmust know your ID in order to request the scores (more restrictive\nbecause people cannot scan the entire list).\n\nIf you DO NOT wish your scores to be available via this mechanism,\nplease reply \"DO NOT POST MY SCORES\" to this message by 3 p.m.,\nFriday, February 3.\n\nThis service is already listed on the \"ICS 1C Student Information\" page \n   <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/student.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/student.html</A>\ndirectly off the ICS 1C home page\n   <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/</A>\nIt's already to go once we remove anyone who would not like their scores\navailable this way.\n\n- -- sdf\nStephen Franklin\nICS 1C Instructor\n\n\n------- End of Forwarded Message\n\n</PRE>\n<!--X-MsgBody-End-->\n<!--X-Follow-Ups-->\n<!--X-Follow-Ups-End-->\n<!--X-References-->\n<!--X-References-End-->\n<!--X-BotPNI-->\n<HR>\n<UL>\n<LI>Prev: <STRONG><A HREF=\"msg00013.html\">Lab Assignment due week of 13 February</A></STRONG></LI>\n<LI>Next: <STRONG><A HREF=\"msg00011.html\">Scores on assignments and quizzes</A></STRONG></LI>\n<LI>Index: <STRONG><A HREF=\"maillist.html#00012\">Mail Index</A></STRONG></LI>\n</UL>\n<!--X-BotPNI-End-->\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
