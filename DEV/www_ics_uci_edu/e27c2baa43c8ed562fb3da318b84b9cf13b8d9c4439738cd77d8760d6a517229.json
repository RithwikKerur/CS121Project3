A major bottleneck\nin proving NP-completeness for geometric problems is a mismatch between\nthe real-number and Turing machine models of computation: one is good\nfor geometric algorithms but bad for reductions, and the other vice\nversa.  Specifically, it is not known on Turing machines how to quickly\ncompare a sum of distances (square roots of integers) with an integer or\nother similar sums, so even (decision versions of) easy problems such as\nthe minimum spanning tree are not known to be in NP.  \n<A HREF=\"http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/\">Joe O'Rourke</A>\ndiscusses an approach to this problem based on bounding the smallest\ndifference between two such sums, so that one could know how precise an\napproximation to compute.\n<P>\n<LI><A HREF=\"tiling-problems.tex\">Tiling problems</A>.\nCollected at a problem session at Smith College, 1993, by\nMarjorie Senechal.\n<P>\n<LI>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.stetson.edu/~efriedma/harmonic/\">Tiling the unit square with rectangles</a>.\nErich Friedman\nshows that the 5/6 by 5/6 square can always be tiled with 1/(<I>k</I>+1) by\n1/(<I>k</I>+1) squares</A>.\nWill all the 1/<I>k</I> by 1/(<I>k</I>+1) rectangles, for <I>k</I>&gt;0,\nfit together in a unit square?\nNote that the sum of the rectangle areas is 1. \nMarc Paulhus can fit them into\na square of side 1.000000001: \"An algorithm for packing squares\",\nJ.
