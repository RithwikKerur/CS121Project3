One of the reasons why they are so\nfeared is they because of their apparent randomness.  Earthquakes\nare powerful, but more intimidating is their invisibility, for\nthey seem to appear out of nowhere.  Ironically, earthquakes are\nonly disasterous if they have struck a populated area.  By\nthemselves, they are nature's what of releasing built up energy.\nData collected at the <A \nHREF=\"http://info.er.usgs.gov/data/geologic/neic/lists/Frequency.html#TABLE4\">U.S. Geological Survey Center</A>\nstates that an earthquake with a onemagnitude change creates 10 times\nmore ground motion and releases 32 times more energy. One of the obvious\nmethods to reduce the loss of life and injury caused by earthquakes is to \nbe able to predict the earthquake before it arrives.  In this research \npaper, I will attempt to outline some of the long-term, \nshort-term, and instantaneous earthquake prediction techniques.  \n</pre>\n\n<H2>Long-Term Prediction Techniques</H2>\n<pre>\n\tThe long-term goals of earthquake prediction allows us to\ndetermine the possiblity of an earthquake years before it strikes. \nHowever, earthquakes are extremely large-scale phenomenas that exist in\n3-D space within the earth's <A \nHREF=\"http://www.geophys.washington.edu/FAC/k_creager.html\">mantle</a>.\n\tThis makes it exceedingly difficult to predict in the long-run. \nFortunately, however, earthquakes do have patterns, and these patterns are\nwhat increases our chances of a successful prediction.\n</pre>\n<UL>\n<LI>Statistical Return Periods<p>\n\tOne way to help predict earthquakes is through statistical return\nperiods.  For example, the <A\nHREF=\"http://scec.gps.caltech.edu/\">Department of Geophysics</a> at\nCaltech keeps track of all earthquakes in California, whether they are\nminor or major.  By studying earthquake reoccurence at the same\napproximate location over a long period of time, we might be able to\nreasonably predict when another earthquake will occur.  For this method to\nbe effective, we must have a long and accurate historical record.\n</p>\n<LI>Earthquake Characteristics\n<p>\n\tIn addition to studying the frequency of certain earthquakes,\nscientists can also study its characteristics.  Seismologists <A\nHREF=\"http://www.geophys.washington.edu/FAC/r_crosson.html\">Robert S.\nCrosson</a> and <A\nHREF=\"http://www.geophys.washington.edu/FAC/s_malone.html\">Stephen D. \nMalone</a> at the <A\nHREF=\"http://jinni.geophys.washington.edu/\">Department of Geophysics\nat the University of Washington</a> work in conjunction with the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.geophys.washington.edu/pnsn.html\">Pacific Northwest\nSeismograph Network</a> to help determine the structure of earthquakes. \nThe PNSN is a collection of more than a hundred various seismic stations\nsurrounding the Pacific Northwest.  Armed with sophisticated equipment,\nseismologists can retreive real-time detection data from an occuring\nearthquake.  By collecting data from a broad area during an earthquake, we\ncan learn more about its motional characteristics.  These motional \ncharacteristics may, in the future, help us to predict when and where an \nearthquake will appear.\n</p> \n</UL>\n\t\n<H2>Short-Term Prediction Techniques</H2>\n\n<pre>\n\tWhile long-term predictions are on the order of years and decades,\nshort-term predictions are on the order of days and possibly, hours.\n</pre>\n<UL>\n<LI>Precursory Phenomena\n<p>\n\n\tOne way to predict an earthquake is through precursory phenomena. \nExamples include dropping water levels in wells, peculiar animal behavior,\nand even strange glows in the sky.  While there are no scientific\nexplanations for these occurences, very high stresses in rocks produce\nheat, cause deformation of rocks, releases gases, and other geomagnetic\neffects.  It is highly possible that these effects can alternate the\nnormal surface of the earth.\n</p>\n\n<LI>Foreshocks\n<p>\n\n\tAnother possible indicator of a upcoming earthquake is the\noccurence of <A\nHREF=\"http://www.seismo.unr.edu/Perminfo/question_answer.html\">foreshocks</a>,\nor small earthquakes before a main shock.  In the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.seismo.unr.edu/Perminfo/question_answer.html\">Questions\nand Answer On Earthquakes</a> at the <A\nHREF=\"http://www.seismo.unr.edu/index.html\">University of Nevada, Reno\nSeismological Laboratory</a>, the chance of another earthquake the same\nsize or larger than the previous quake is 6%. As time passes, that\npercentage drops.  This method od prediction lies on the fact that the\nearth's core releases pressure in small packets before the main rupture. \nA single earthquake has a low probability of leading to a larger quake,\nbut several small earthquakes in an area identified as a seismic gap can\nincrease the probability.\n</p>\n</UL>\n<H2>Instantaneous Prediction Techniques</H2>\n<UL>\n<LI>Alarm Systems\n<p>\n\tScientists have also been able to predict an earthquake within\nseconds of its occurence.  Unfortunately, the only sure way to predict an\nearthquake is after it has happened.  Fortunately, however, in a number of\ncases, the danger of an earthquake comes from the shock waves arriving\nfrom an earthquake with its epicenter some distance away.  In these cases,\nit is possible to set up an alarm system that can warn neighboring cities\nbefore the shock waves arrive.  The 20 or 30 seconds warning can allow\nfactories, power stations, and other mechanical operations to be safely\nshut down.  Most of the damage from an earthquake comes from the fires\nproceeding the quake.  With this system, potentially dangerous fires can\nbe minimized by shutting down all energy-intensive operations. \n</p>\n</UL>\n<H2>Conclusions</H2>\n<pre>\n\tGiven the nature of an earthquake occurence, it is\nunlikely that we will ever be able to predict earthquakes with\n100% accuracy.  However, by aggregating the signs from various\nsources such as surface deformation, previous statistics, earthquake\nmotion data, and precurosry phenomena, we can increase the probability\nof a successful prediction.\n</pre>\n<HR>\n<H2>Seismological Resource Sites</H2>\n<i>These sites contain general earthquake/earthquake prediction information.\n</i>\n<br>\n<UL>\n<LI>Southern California Earthquake Center@UCLA: <A \nHREF=\"http://scec.ess.ucla.edu/\">http://scec.ess.ucla.edu/</A>\n<LI>Harvard University: <A HREF=\"http://tempo.harvard.edu/homepage.html\">http://tempo.harvard.edu/homepage.html</A>\n<LI>University of Alaska, Geophysical Institute: <A \nHREF=\"http://www.gi.alaska.edu/\">http://www.gi.alaska.edu/</A>\n<LI>Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory: <A \nHREF=\"http://aslwww.cr.usgs.gov/\">http://aslwww.cr.usgs.gov/</A>\n</UL>\n<HR>\nReturn to <A HREF=\"#top\">Introduction.</A>\n<br>\n<i>\nJump to <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">www.ics.uci.edu</A>\n</i>\n</BODY> \n</HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
