That line of work seemed to\nend there, but our recent insight was that this algorithm can be applied to\nother problems. In this talk, we introduce the algorithmic ideas behind it,\nand how they apply to a variety of problems, such as stable matching in\nrestricted settings, Euclidean TSP, computing straight skeletons, and\nshortest superstring. For instance, with this approach we reduce the runtime\nfor the multi-fragment heuristic for Euclidean TSP from O(n^2) to O(n log n).\nFor some problems, the work is still ongoing, but nearest-neighbor chains\nprovide an interesting new approach.\n\n\n<p>\nJoint work with Alon Efrat, David Eppstein, Daniel Frishberg, Michael\nGoodrich, Stephen Kouborov, Pedro Matias, and Valentin Polishchuk\n\n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
