These will usually involve some reading and a few short problems to introduce you to a topic and help prepare you to ask questions and work in the lab the following week. </font></li>\n  <li><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Lab Assignments, which you will do in pairs and submit electronically at the end of your lab session the following Friday. </font></li>\n</ul>\n<p><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">The first week's lab assignment (Lab Assignment 0) is very short so you can complete it at the first lab session on Friday, September 23.</font></p>\n<p><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">The lab  assignments will require you to do pair programming:\n  You and a classmate will work together at one computer, following <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/pair.html\">specific guidelines</a>.  This makes the scheduled lab\n  hours on Monday/Wednesday/Friday particularly valuable as a time when everyone\n  in the class is certain to be available (along with the TA and lab tutor).</FONT></p>\n<P> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">We encourage you to talk with each other and\n  help each other understand how to do the assignments.  There are some limits,\n  though.  Everyone should read the <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/collab.html\">guidelines for collaboration and independent work</A>.</FONT></P>\n<P><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">Don't expect every answer to every problem to be immediately obvious. If you find yourself stuck on a problem, take these five steps:  (1) Re-read the problem; (2) follow the design recipe; (3) go back and look at how you (or we) solved similar problems; (4) recheck the explanation in the textbook or lecture notes; and (5) if you've spent three solid minutes thinking about the problem without making any progress, it's time to ask somebody (a classmate, or i41@uci.edu). If you're making progress, if you have an educated guess (not a blind guess) about what to try next, then keep going\u2014we're not saying that every problem can be solved in three minutes. But after you've spent three minutes of hard thinking with no progress and no idea of what to do next, more thinking isn't likely to help.  We want to minimize your frustration, and in cases like this we (or sometimes your classmates) can often get you past your trouble pretty quickly.  (If you haven't followed the steps above, though\u2014especially reading the problem and following the design recipe\u2014we'll probably just send you back to do them.  You have to do your part, but after that we're happy to step in and do ours.) </font></P>\n<OL TYPE=\"1\">\n  <LI> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">Setup, DrRacket, and Picturing Programs (PP) Chapters 0\u20132:  <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/lab0.html\">Lab Assignment 0</a> (due at the end of lab on September 23); PP Chapters 3\u20136: <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/hw1.html\">First Homework</A> (show your work to the TA at the start of lab on September 26).</FONT> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/lab1.html\">Lab Assignment 1</a> is due at the end of lab on Friday, September 30.</FONT></LI>\n       \n  \n  <LI><FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">PP Chapters 6\u201318: <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/hw2.html\">Second Homework</A> (show your work to the TA at the start of lab on October 3); <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/lab2.html\">Lab Assignment 2</a> (due at the end of lab on October 7).</FONT></LI>\n\n\n  <LI><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">PP Chapters 13\u201322: </font> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/hw3.html\">Third Homework</A> (show your work to the TA at the start of lab on October 10); <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/lab3.html\">Third Lab Assignment</a> (due at the end of lab on October 14).<BR />\n  </FONT></LI>  \n  \n  \n<LI><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">PP Chapters 22\u201324:</font> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/hw4.html\">Fourth Homework</A> (show your work to the TA at the start of lab on October 17);\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/lab4.html\">Fourth Lab Assignment</a> \n (due at the end of lab on October 21).  <BR />\n  </FONT></LI>\n\n  <LI><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">PP Chapters 25-27:</font> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\"><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/hw5.html\">Fifth Homework</A> (show your work to the TA at the start of lab on October 24); <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/lab5.html\">Fifth Lab Assignment</a> (due at the end of lab on October 28).<BR />\n  </FONT></LI>\n<LI> <FONT FACE=\"Goudy Old Style\">PP Chapter 28, higher-order functions: <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/hw6.html\">Sixth Homework</A> (show your work to the TA at the start of lab on October 31);\n\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/lab6.html\">Sixth Lab Assignment</a> \n\n(due at the end of lab on November 4).<BR />\n  </FONT></LI>\n \n<LI><font face=\"Goudy Old Style\">PP Chapter 29; Deus X machine, restaurants with files, and more: <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/hw7.html\">Seventh Homework</A> (show your work to the TA at the start of lab on  November 7); <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/i41/hw/lab7.html\">Seventh Lab Assignment</a> (due at the end of the day on Friday, November 11).\n      <A HREF=\"http://eee.uci.edu/09f/37000/hwans/hw7ans.txt\">Solutions</A> to the Deus X problrems are available on line, but if you look at them before working the problems out completely by hand, you won't learn it well enough to do problems on the quizzes.
