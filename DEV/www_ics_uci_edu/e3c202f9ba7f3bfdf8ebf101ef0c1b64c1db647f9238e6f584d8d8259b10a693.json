It will answer many of the questions that you may have about the grading process, and will save you a lot of upset waiting for a response to an email question.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the final grades for Informatics 45.  By University regulations, at this stage, the cutpoints and the grades are non-negotiable, unnless we made a clerical error, such as recording a score incorrectly.  <i>(Seriously!  This means you!  Almost every quarter, I get at least one email that begin with a phrase like \"I know you said that the cutpoints are non-negotiable, but...\")</i>  We also can no longer accept new regrade requests on the projects.</p>\n\n<p>There were 52 points possible on the Final.  The average score was 48.78 (93.80%), with many perfect scores.  Average project scores were also quite high and a fairly high proportion of A and A- grades were seen this time around.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an explanation of the various columns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The IDSuffix column contains the last four digits of your UCI ID# or Access ID#.</li>\n  <li>The Proj1..Proj4 columns are your scores (out of 18) on each project.</li>\n  <li>The Final column contains your raw score on the Final Exam.</li>\n  <li>The TotalPct column is your overall percentage in the class, figured by adding the weighted percentages of the project scores and Final together, as described in the <a href=\"CourseReference.html\">Course Reference</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are a few words to be said about the selection of cutpoints.  People are cutpoints; whole-numbered percentages are not.  That means that the cutpoint for a particular grade is simply the lowest-scoring person who received that grade.  For the sake of argument, if you received a percentage of 54.99% in the class, and someone who received a 55.52% received a higher grade than you (with no person in between), you didn't miss the cutpoint by 0.01%; you missed it by 0.53% &mdash; a substantial margin.</p>\n\n<p>I enjoyed working with you all this quarter and hope to see you again sometime down the road.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n\n<hr />\n\n<p class=\"title\">The grades</p>\n\n<table class=\"normal\">\n  <tr class=\"top\"><td>IDSuffix</td><td>Proj1</td><td>Proj2</td><td>Proj3</td><td>Proj4</td><td>Final</td><td>TotalPct</td><td>Grade</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>2360</td><td>16</td><td>13</td><td>10.5</td><td>16</td><td>52</td><td>82.81%</td><td>B+</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>3180</td><td>17.5</td><td>16.5</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>52</td><td>94.79%</td><td>A</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>3245</td><td>16.5</td><td>17.5</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>46</td><td>93.99%</td><td>A</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>4181</td><td>12</td><td>15.25</td><td>14.5</td><td>14.5</td><td>43</td><td>79.27%</td><td>B</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>4232</td><td>10</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>13.54%</td><td>F</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>5813</td><td>18</td><td>14.5</td><td>14</td><td>14.5</td><td>48</td><td>86.62%</td><td>A-</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>6015</td><td>14</td><td>15.25</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>50</td><td>76.38%</td><td>B</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>6510</td><td>10</td><td>14.5</td><td>11</td><td>15</td><td>52</td><td>77.60%</td><td>B</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>7130</td><td>17.75</td><td>0</td><td>16</td><td>0</td><td>46</td><td>57.27%</td><td>C</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>7191</td><td>16</td><td>12.5</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>50</td><td>88.10%</td><td>A-</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>7220</td><td>16.5</td><td>13</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>50</td><td>91.23%</td><td>A</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>7328</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>14</td><td>47</td><td>80.93%</td><td>B</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>7669</td><td>8</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>11.46%</td><td>NR</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>7956</td><td>17.5</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>18</td><td>52</td><td>95.31%</td><td>A</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>8126</td><td>17.75</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>52</td><td>99.74%</td><td>A+</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>8214</td><td>15</td><td>17.5</td><td>15</td><td>18</td><td>52</td><td>93.23%</td><td>A</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>8265</td><td>15.5</td><td>17.5</td><td>18</td><td>18</td><td>49</td><td>95.43%</td><td>A</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>8287</td><td>17</td><td>14</td><td>16</td><td>15</td><td>48</td><td>87.66%</td><td>A-</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>8490</td><td>16</td><td>14</td><td>11</td><td>15</td><td>0</td><td>58.33%</td><td>C</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>8889</td><td>15.5</td><td>17.5</td><td>17</td><td>18</td><td>48</td><td>93.91%</td><td>A</td></tr>\n  <tr><td>9752</td><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>16.5</td><td>18</td><td>41</td><td>88.98%</td><td>A-</td></tr>\n</table>\n\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
