Wolf, Lori A. Clarke, and Jack C. Wileden\nin <I>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</I>, 14(3), pages\n250-263, March 1989.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nDespite the importance of describing and analyzing the relationships among a\nsoftware system's components, most languages and development environments do\nnot provide suitable support for these activities. While Ada and the various\nexisting Ada environments offer some assistance, the capabilities they offer\nare inadequate for use in truly large and complex software development\nprojects. To address these shortcomings, we are developing the AdaPIC toolset,\nwhich we envision as an important component of an Ada software development\nenvironment. The AdaPIC toolset is one particular instantiation, specifically\nadapted for use with Ada, of the more general collection of language features\nand analysis capabilities that constitute the PIC approach to describing and\nanalyzing relationships among software system components. This toolset is\nbeing tailored to support an incremental approach to the interface control\naspects of the software development process. Following a discussion of the\ninterface control and incremental development concepts, this paper describes\nthe AdaPIC toolset, concentrating on its analysis tools and support for\nincremental development and demonstrating how it contributes to the technology\nfor developing large Ada software systems.\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:24:26 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
