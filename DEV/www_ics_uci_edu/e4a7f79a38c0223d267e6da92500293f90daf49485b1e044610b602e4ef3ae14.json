It was in the 1960's when this idea was explored further, giving rise to visions of a \"docuverse\" that people could swim through, revolutionizing all aspects of human-information interaction. Only now has the technology caught up with these dreams, making it possible to implement them on a global scale.\n<p>\n\nThe <b>World-Wide Web</b> is officially <a name=\"i80\">described</a> as a \"wide-area hypermedia information retrieval initiative aiming to give universal access to a large universe of documents\". What the World-Wide Web (WWW, W3) project has done is provide users on computer networks with a consistent means to access a variety of media in a simplified fashion. Using a popular software interface to the Web called <a name=\"i40\"><b>Mosaic</b></a>, the Web project has changed the way people view and create information - it has created the first true global hypermedia network.\n<p>\n\nThe earliest visions of such systems had as their goal the advancement of science and education. Although the World-Wide Web project has the potential to make a significant impact in these areas, it is poised to revolutionize many elements of society, including commerce, politics, and literature.\n<p>\n\n<img src=\"graphics/hr.gif\" alt=\"--\"><br>\n<a href=\"guide.15.html\"><img src=\"graphics/btn.back.gif\" alt=\"[Back]\"></a><a href=\"guide.toc.html\"><img src=\"graphics/btn.contents.gif\" alt=\"[Contents]\"></a><a href=\"guide.02.html\"><img src=\"graphics/btn.next.gif\" alt=\"[Next]\"></a>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
