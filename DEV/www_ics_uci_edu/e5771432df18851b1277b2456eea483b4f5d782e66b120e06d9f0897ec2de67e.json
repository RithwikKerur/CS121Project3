Instructors from other units at UCI should contact their own units' <a href=\"https://eee.uci.edu/help/turnitin/\">coordinators</a>; for help with this, contact Steve Franklin (<a href=\"mailto:franklin@uci.edu\">franklin@uci.edu</a>), the campus coordinator for Turnitin.com.</font></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">The campus has a contract with Turnitin that allows\nunlimited use by any class on campus.  Instructors now interact\nwith Turnitin.com themselves; back when there was money, we had a grad student who could help coordinate this. </FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">There are four steps to using Turnitin.com:</FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Register yourself and your course with Turnitin.com</FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Give students notice that Turnitin.com will be used,\nas mandated by UCI&#39;s agreement with Turnitin.com</FONT>\n</LI><BR />\n<LI>If you want to check a single student's work, submit it to Turnitin.com yourself. <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">To check all your students' assignments, you may  instruct your students\nto submit their own assignments directly to Turnitin.com (which is both\ninconvenient and subject to subterfuge&mdash;a student might submit one\nversion to you for grading and a different version to Turnitin.com for plagiarism\nchecking).</FONT> You may also have students submit their work via Checkmate (checkmate.ics.uci.edu) or the EEE DropBox and then write a shell script to manage the batch submission to Turnitin.com.\n</LI><BR />\n<LI>\n  <FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Review the Turnitin.com similarity report(s)</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Each step is described below.</FONT></P>\n<BR />\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\"><B>Register yourself and your course with Turnitin.com</B></FONT></P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">First, send David Kay a message (<A HREF=\"mailto:kay@ics.uci.edu\">kay@ics.uci.edu</A>);\nhe&#39;ll send you the ICS account ID and password you&#39;ll need to register. </FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Go to <A HREF=\"http://www.turnitin.com\">www.turnitin.com</A>\nand click &quot;Create a User Profile.&quot;  This launches a series of\nregistration screens. [Note that Turnitin.com's user interface is notorious for changing frequently.]</FONT></LI><BR />\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">In step 1, enter your UCInet ID (your Email address\n@uci.edu) where it asks for an Email address.  </FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">In step 2, enter a password (which is between you\nand Turnitin.com; it need not be your UCInet ID password).  </FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">In step 3, enter your name, &quot;US&quot;, and &quot;California&quot;. </FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">In step 4, enter &quot;instructor&quot;.  </FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">In step 5, read the agreement and click &quot;Agree&quot;. </FONT></LI><BR />\n</UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Then click to start the class setup process.</FONT></LI><BR />\n<UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">In step 1, enter the ICS account and password you\nreceived from David Kay.</FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">In step 2, enter the name of your course, following\nthe format of these examples: &quot;Spring 2004 ICS 131:  Social Analysis\nof Computerization&quot; or &quot;Summer 10-week 2004 ICS 139W:  Communications\nSkills for Computer Scientists&quot;</FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">In step 3, make a note of the class ID number you&#39;ve\nbeen assigned.  Choose a &quot;class enrollment password.&quot;</FONT></LI><BR />\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Step 4 asks you to specify a name and due date for\nyour first assignment.  The due date tells us when it&#39;s safe to start\nuploading assignments.  You can modify and add assignment information later.</FONT></LI><BR />\n</UL>\n<LI>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">After you receive confirmation of the previous step,\ngo back to <A HREF=\"http://www.turnitin.com\">www.turnitin.com</A> and log\nin with the Email address and password you specified.  This will show you\nyour course.</FONT></LI>\n</UL>\n<BR />\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\"><B>Give students notice that Turnitin.com will be\nused</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">UCI&#39;s agreement with Turnitin.com requires that\nstudents be notified about some aspects of the system&#39;s use.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">The best way to achieve this is to ask students to\nsign the following statement.  If you typically give students a questionnaire\nthat collects demographic information, you could include this text at the\nbottom, perhaps introduced with some softening language (e.g., &quot; We\napologize for this fine print, but the University wants us to be perfectly\nclear about a couple of things.  Please read this carefully and sign it.&quot;).</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">I understand and agree that to protect the value\nof the independent work that I do in this course, the work of all students\nin the course may be compared for textual analysis and evidence of plagiarism\nto the work of other students, both in this course and in others, and to\nother sources on the Internet and elsewhere.  This may involve the storage\nof students&#39; work on computer systems outside of the university, such\nas the Turnitin.com reference database; this storage is solely for purposes\nof detecting plagiarism.  Use of the Turnitin.com service is subject to\nthe usage policy agreement posted on the Turnitin.com site.  Students who\nwish an offline alternative to Turnitin.com should check with their instructor;\ntypical offline alternatives include providing a full annotated bibliography\nand copies of all cited works with each submitted assignment.  I promise\nto follow all the university, departmental, and course policies about academic\nhonesty.</FONT></P>\n<BR />\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Signature: _______________________________      \n                       Date: ____________</FONT></P>\n<BR />\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">The requirement for providing an offline alternative\nprobably comes from courses where students write about very personal and\npotentially embarrassing topics.  In computer science classes, this presumably\nshould not be an issue.  The alternatives are meant to be burdensome enough\nto dissuade students from requesting them and thorough enough to demonstrate\nwith confidence that a student who does use them will have done his or her\nown work.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">It would be reasonable to allow students to return\nthis signed statement at the next class meeting, so those few who actually\nwish to read the various policies have an opportunity to do so before signing.\n Have a TA check the returned statements off against the class roster and\nkeep after straggling students. You could also reproduce this information\non your syllabus, so students continue to have access to it (see an <A HREF=\"turnitin.com_guidelines_files/plagiarism-don_t_do_it_.html\">enhanced sample</A>\nthat supplements but does not replace the text above).</FONT><BR />\n</P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\"><B>Have students submit their assignments electronically\nvia Checkmate</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Turnitin.com&#39;s original model is that individual\nstudents submit their own work to Turnitin.com.  The problem with this,\nbesides having to teach students how to use the system and dealing with\ntheir difficulties, is that a student could easily submit a plagiarized\nversion to the instructor for grading and a different, non-plagiarized version\nto Turnitin.com.  Some instructors may be willing to live with this, or\nto grade students&#39; work directly from their Turnitin.com submissions;\nif so, that course of action is available.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">But the better way to handle this is to have students\nmake a single electronic submission using the Checkmate system in ICS (checkmate.ics.uci.edu).\n Those submissions can be downloaded and viewed or printed for grading;\nthey can also be collected and submitted in a batch to Turnitin.com.</FONT><BR />\n</P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\"><B>Review the Turnitin.com similarity reports</B></FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT FACE=\"AGaramond\">Within a couple of days after the assignments are\nsubmitted to Turnitin.com, the instructor can log back in to Turnitin.com\nand view the similarity report.  As always, these reports should serve as\nindications of papers that merit further (human) investigation; accusations\nshouldn&#39;t be made solely on the strength of any automated tool.</FONT></P>\n<BR />\n<BR CLEAR=ALL />\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
