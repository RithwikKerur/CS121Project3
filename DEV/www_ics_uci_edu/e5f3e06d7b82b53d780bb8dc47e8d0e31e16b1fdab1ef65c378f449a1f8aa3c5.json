In this talk I will give an overview on how\nbroadcast encryption and traitor tracing can be used for content\nprotection.  The focus of the talk will be on tracing traitors for\nanonymous attack, a way to trace the source of unauthorized copies\nwhen the system is broadcasted. Our solution has been adopted by\nAACS, (the content protection standards for next generation high\ndefinition DVDs),  the first large-scale deployment of traitor\ntracing approach, Along the way we have had to solve both practical\nand theoretical problems that had not been apparent in the literature\nto date.  In this talk I will discuss some of those problems.  The\ntalk will also include the recent incidence of AACS \"break\". \n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
