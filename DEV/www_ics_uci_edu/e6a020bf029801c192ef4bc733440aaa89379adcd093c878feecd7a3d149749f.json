Our contributions are relevant in the context of both exact\r\nand approximate reasoning over Bayesian and Markov networks, weighted constraint satisfaction problems, and other related queries. While the focus of this work is on probabilistic\r\nand constraint inference, we also draw from the areas of distributed computing and statistical learning. Relevant practical applications we consider include genetic linkage analysis,\r\nprotein side-chain prediction, medical diagnosis, resource scheduling, and signal processing.\r\n\r\n<p>We extend AND/OR Branch-and-Bound (AOBB), a leading algorithm for optimization\r\nqueries over graphical models. AOBB applies the principle of depth-first branch-and-bound\r\nto AND/OR search spaces, which exploit conditional independencies via problem decomposition and merge unifiable subproblems through caching of partial solutions. This thesis\r\npresents fundamental extensions to AOBB in three regards.\r\n\r\n<p>First, we significantly improve the applicability of AOBB as an approximation scheme. We\r\nanalyze and demonstrate the inherent conflict between problem decomposition (through\r\nAND/OR search spaces) and the anytime behavior of AOBB and depth-first search in\r\ngeneral. We introduce a new algorithm, Breadth-Rotating AND/OR Branch-and-Bound\r\n(BRAOBB), which drastically improves upon AOBB with respect to its anytime performance while maintaining desirable depth-first complexity guarantees. Comprehensive analysis and experimental evaluation demonstrate the scheme\u2019s effectiveness. Furthermore, our\r\nentry based on BRAOBB placed first in all three optimization tracks of the PASCAL 2012\r\nProbabilistic Inference Challenge.\r\n\r\n<p>Second, we investigate the instance-based run-time complexity of AOBB. The asymptotic\r\nworst-case bounds are both time and space exponential in the problem\u2019s induced width, but\r\noften prove to be very loose due to the algorithm\u2019s powerful pruning, as we show empirically.\r\nWe identify a range of (sub)problem features and develop learning schemes to estimate runtime complexity based on statistical regression analysis. We conduct extensive experimental\r\nevaluation within and across various problem classes and demonstrate convincing predictive\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n<p>Third, we describe a parallel AND/OR Branch-and-Bound scheme that pushes the boundaries of feasibility for exact reasoning by orders of magnitude. We adapt the paradigm of\r\nparallel tree search to AND/OR search spaces; our implementation distributes conditioned\r\nsubproblems on a grid of independent computers. In this context, we show how the pruning\r\npower of AOBB can cause large variance in subproblem complexity, which makes load balancing extremely elusive and impairs parallel performance. We thus propose load balancing\r\nbased on the run-time estimation scheme presented earlier in the thesis, learning a complexity model offline from previously solved subproblems. Through experimental results using\r\nhundreds of computers on problem instances from a variety of classes we show convincing\r\nparallel performance with several orders of magnitude speedup over sequential AOBB, but\r\nwe also highlight and analyze some inherent limitations.\r\n\r\n<p>Our implementations of AOBB, BRAOBB and parallel AOBB are available online under an\r\nopen-source license.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <br>\r\n      <a target=\"blank\" href=\"r198.pdf\">\r\n      <b>[pdf]</b></a>\r\n      </td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n  </tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</center>\r\n<br>\r\n<!-- End Body-->\r\n<!--- Begin Footer --><div id=\"footer\"><centeR>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu\">School of Information and Computer Science</A>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu\">University of California, Irvine, CA 92697-3435</a>\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dechter\">Dr. Rina Dechter</A>\n\r\n<A HREF=\"mailto:dechter_at_ics.uci.edu\">dechter at ics.uci.edu</A>\r\n\n</center></div><!--- End Footer -->\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
