(Other questions will not involve\nmuch/any math.)  We've talked about and worked out in class questions\ninvolving math on several occasions since the start of the quarter\n(look at the graph in the first readings), including last Friday.\n\nIn response to student requests for sample \"math\" problems, the following\ncollection is offered.  Select from them freely, but there is NO REASON\nTO DO THEM ALL.  Many, Many are the same as others with slight changes.\nPhrases like \"Answer all the above assuming ...\" are not intended literally.\n\nOptional question:  How many questions are given below?\n\n-- sdf\nStephen Franklin\nICS 1C Instructor\n\nKB = Kilobytes; KB/sec = Kilobytes per second;\n\nQuestion A0:\nA web browser contacts a server and retrieves a 6KB document which includes\n5 in-line images totaling 30KB (3 are less than 2KB, one is 8KB and one is\n20KB).  Assuming that each document and each in-line image requires 2\nseconds to request and that the server sends data to the client at 10KB/sec\nwith a minimum transmission time of 0.5 seconds, how long does it take to\nretrieve and display the document including all the in-line images?\n\nA1: In question A0, change the length of the original document to 26KB.\nA2: In question A0, change \"2 seconds\" to \"3 seconds\"\nA3: In question A0, double the transmission speed.\nA4: In question A0, make the minimum transmission time 2 seconds.\nA5: In question A0, change \"5 in-line images totalling 30KB (...)\"\n    to \"15 in-line images each 2KB in size\"\n\nQuestion B0:\nModify question A to assume \n  (1) all images are stored compressed by a factor of 4,\n  (2) server decompression takes a 1 second per 4KB of compressed\n      image or fraction thereof (that is, decompressing any image\n      larger than 4KB and no larger than 8KB takes 2 seconds), and \n  (3) decompression by the browser is 3 times slower than on the server.\nAnswer A0-A5 assuming the server does all decompression.\nAnswer A0-A5 assuming the browser does all decompression.\nAnswer A0-A5 assuming that each decompression is done in such a way as\n  to complete the display process in the minimum amount of time.\nAnswer all the above, assuming that the compression factor is 10.\nAnswer all the above assuming that browser decompression is 5 times\n  slower than server decompression.\n\n==================================================================\nThe following questions refer to the graphs at\n  <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/logbytepack.gif\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/logbytepack.gif</A>\nSee also <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/netstats.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/netstats.html</A>\n\nNotation:  \"[apples/oranges/pears]\" means to choose one of the\n  alternatives: apples, oranges, pears\n\nFor each service/protocol and each month, you should be able to tell\nhow many bytes and how many packets, were reported for that month.\n\nWhat was the approximate average number of bytes in a packet in (pick a\nmonth) for [ftp/gopher/www]?\n\nLet X, Y, Z be 3 distinct choices from the list: ftp, gopher, www, Z39.50.\nIn what months (if any) did the SUM of X and Y traffic (measured\nin [bytes/packets]) exceed Z traffic?\n\nLet X and Y be 2 distinct choices from the list: ftp, gopher, www, Z39.50.\n  In what months (if any) was X traffic 3 times that of Y?\nNow replace \"3\" by any other positive number.\n\nIn what months (if any) was the number of [ftp/gopher/www] packets at\nleast 1 [million/billion] more than in the previous month?\n</PRE>\n<!--X-MsgBody-End-->\n<!--X-Follow-Ups-->\n<!--X-Follow-Ups-End-->\n<!--X-References-->\n<!--X-References-End-->\n<!--X-BotPNI-->\n<HR>\n<UL>\n<LI>Prev: <STRONG><A HREF=\"msg00018.html\">Assignment 4 and beyond: \"The Term Project\"</A></STRONG></LI>\n<LI>Next: <STRONG><A HREF=\"msg00016.html\">Quiz 3, Friday Feb 24</A></STRONG></LI>\n<LI>Index: <STRONG><A HREF=\"maillist.html#00017\">Mail Index</A></STRONG></LI>\n</UL>\n<!--X-BotPNI-End-->\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
