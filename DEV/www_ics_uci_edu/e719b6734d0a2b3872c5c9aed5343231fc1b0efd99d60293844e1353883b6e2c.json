contact me as soon as\r\n  possible).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IN ALL CASES, you must drop off (on time) whatever part of the program you\r\n  have written</b>, if you are to receive any partial credit for a submission\r\n  (either on time or late with permission); if you drop off no files, I must\r\n  assume that you have done no work on the assignment (which will result in a\r\n  grade of 0).\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Pair Programming</h3>\r\nWe will use <b>pair programming</b> on most assignments (either <b>required</b>\r\n  or <b>optional</b>, although it is sometimes <b>prohibited</b>); it is only\r\n  on these assignments that students can closely collaborate with their\r\n  partners, turning in a single, joint program.\r\nOnly <b>ONE STUDENT</b> from the pair should drop off (all parts of) the\r\n  program -which one doesn't matter- but the <b>NAMES</b> of both students\r\n  <b>MUST APPEAR IN A COMMENT</b> inside the code file(s).\r\nSee <a href=\"../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html\">Pair Programming</a> for\r\n  details about pair programming, and the right and wrong ways to do it.\r\nThere is a tremendous amount to be gained by both group members, if they\r\n  pair program in the right way.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you are having problems finding a student to pair with, or believe that\r\n  you your schedule disallows the ability to work in a pair, contact me\r\n  immediately.\r\nWithout making prior arrangments with me, individual students submitting a\r\n  program when pairing is mandatory will have their grade reduced by 25%.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Starting Programs</h3>\r\nPlease read each assignment completely and carefully before starting it.\r\nI suggest that you print and then read it, marking relevant material with a\r\n  highlighter (details that you might forget by the end of an assignment).\r\nWe will typically discuss each new assignment in Lab on the Thursday it is\r\n  assigned, and start working on it then.\r\n<!--- (although you will optionally be able to work on\r\n  the previous assignment, if you have not already turned it in).\r\n--->\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Extra Points for Submitting Early</h3>\r\nIf you drop off your program early, you will receive extra points (1 point if\r\n  you submit it 24 hours early, 2 points if you submit it 48 hours early).\r\nSince each program is worth 40 points, you can raise your grade on a program\r\n  by 5% (half a letter grade) by turning it in two days early.\r\nNote that turning in a program more than two days early results in just\r\n  2 extra points; therefore, I encourage students to finish their programs as\r\n  early as possible, but continue to think about them (and ask questions about\r\n  them) until two days before the due date, and submit them early at that time.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Programming Assignments</h3>\r\nI will turn text into links below on the assigned date.\r\n<p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\" rules=\"all\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th>Program</th><th>Assigned</th><th>Due</th><th>Description</th><th>Pairing?</th>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #0 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#0</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/05</td><td align=\"center\">4/11</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program0/program.html\">\r\n  Computing Infrastructure\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Prohibited</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #1 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#1</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/12</td><td align=\"center\">4/18</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program1/program.html\">\r\n  Simple Program Suite\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Required</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #2 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#2</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/19</td><td align=\"center\">4/25</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program2/program.html\">\r\n Intermediate Programming Suite I\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #3 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#3</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/26</td><td align=\"center\">5/2</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program3/program.html\">\r\n  Intermediate Programming Suite II\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #4 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#4</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">5/3</td><td align=\"center\">5/16</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program4/program.html\">\r\n  Programming with Classes\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #5\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#5</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">5/17</td><td align=\"center\">5/28</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program5/program.html\">\r\n  Programming with the File I/O Classes\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n ------->\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #5 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#5</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">5/17</td><td align=\"center\">5/23</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program5/program.html\">\r\n  Writing Classes\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #6 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#6</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">5/24</td><td align=\"center\">6/8</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program6/program.html\">\r\n  Writing Classes with Arrays and Interfaces\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Optional</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- \r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#7</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">11/19</td><td align=\"center\">12/23</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program7/program.html\">\r\n</a>\r\n  Programming with Arrays/Lists I\r\n<td>Optional</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #9\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#8</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">3/28</td><td align=\"center\">4/4</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program8/program.html\">\r\n  More Arrays and Classes\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Optional</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#9</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/4</td><td align=\"center\">4/11</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program9/program.html\">\r\n  Programming with Inheritance\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Optional</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #10\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#10</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/11</td><td align=\"center\">4/25(2x+)</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program10/program.html\">\r\n</a>\r\nFinal Project: Photomosaics\r\n<td>Optional</td>\r\n\r\n ------->\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\">\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
