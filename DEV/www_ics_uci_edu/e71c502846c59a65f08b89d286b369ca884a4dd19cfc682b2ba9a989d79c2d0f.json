contact me as soon as possible).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IN ALL CASES, you must drop off (on time) whatever part of the program you\r\n  have written</b>, if you are to receive any partial credit for a submission\r\n  (either on time or late with permission); if you drop off <b>no</b> files, I\r\n   must assume that you have done <b>no</b> work on the assignment (which will\r\n  result in a grade of 0 for it).\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Pair Programming</h3>\r\nWe will use <b>pair programming</b> on most assignments (either <b>required</b>\r\n  or <b>recommended</b>, although it is sometimes <b>prohibited</b>); it is only\r\n  on these assignments that students can closely collaborate with their\r\n  partners, turning in one copy of a jointly written program.\r\nSee <a href=\"../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html\">Pair Programming</a> for\r\n  details about pair programming, and the right and wrong ways to do it.\r\nThere is a tremendous amount to be gained by both partners, if they pair\r\n  program the right way.\r\n<p>\r\nYou can keep the same partner for multiple assignments or switch.\r\nTry to find a partner in your lab who has approximately your skill level and\r\n  study habits (e.g., working evening vs. weekends, work ethic to submit\r\n  programs early); try to find someone who lives near you (or with whom you\r\n  can easily meet outside lab) because I expect partners will need time outside\r\n  labs to finish the programs.\r\nI recommend finding a partner in your lab, but there is also a MessageBoard\r\n  Forum for this task.\r\n<p>\r\nIf you believe that your schedule or life-circumstances disallow the ability to\r\n  work in a pair, contact me immediately by email.\r\nWithout making prior arrangments with me, individual students submitting a\r\n  program when pairing is required will receive a substantial point deduction.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Starting/Finishing Programs</h3>\r\nPlease read each assignment completely and carefully before starting it.\r\nI suggest that you print and then read it, marking relevant material with a\r\n  highlighter (details that you might forget by the end of an assignment).\r\nThen, re-read the assignment before submitting your work.\r\nStudents should plan to have finished their current programs by the day before\r\n  when the next program is started, so they can work on the new program during\r\n  that lab; see below for how this leads to extra credit.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Extra Points for Submitting Early</h3>\r\nIf you drop off your program early, you will receive extra points (1 point if\r\n  you submit it 24 hours early, 2 points if you submit it 48 hours early).\r\nSince each program is worth 50 points, you can raise your grade on a program\r\n  by 4% (almost half a letter grade) by turning it in two days early.\r\nNote that turning in a program more than two days early still results in just\r\n  2 extra points: the maximum you can get for an early turn-in.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identifying Submissions</h3>\r\n\r\nOnly <b>ONE STUDENT</b> should submit the assignment (all parts of it).\r\nIf students work in pairs, <b>BOTH NAMES</b> and their lab numbers must\r\n  appear in a comment at the top of each submitted program; it should appear as\r\n  follows\r\n<pre><b>\r\n# Romeo Montague, Lab 1\r\n# Juliet Capulet, Lab 1\r\n# We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming\r\n#   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming:\r\n#   primarily that both partners worked on all parts together.</b></pre>\r\nIf you do not know what the terms <b>cooperatively</b> and/or\r\n  <b>rules for pair programming</b> mean, please read about\r\n  <a href=\"../../../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html\">Pair Programming</a> \r\n  before starting this assignment.\r\n<p>\r\nIf the names do not appear at the top of all your submissions, there will be a\r\n  point deduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Multiple Submissions</h3>\r\nCheckmate allows students to remove a submission and then resubmit.\r\nWe will grade only your final submission (and extra credit points are based on\r\n  only that submission).\r\nFor assignments with multiple parts, please turn in each part\r\n  <b>as you finish it</b>, so that I can accurately assess the progress of the\r\n  class as a whole during this assignment.\r\nIf you discover something wrong with your code after you submit it, you can\r\n  always correct the code, remove the code, and resubmit the code.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>No Retrieval</h3>\r\nStudents cannot retrieve a submission from Checkmate; so, you are responsible\r\n  for archiving your work so that you have a copy of what you submit.\r\nAlso, ensure that you turn in the correct (most up to date) version of your\r\n  code.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Programming Assignments</h3>\r\nI will turn text into links below on the assigned date.\r\n<p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\" rules=\"all\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th>Program</th><th>Assigned</th><th>Due</th><th>Description</th><th>Pairing?</th>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #0 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#0</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/3</td><td align=\"center\">4/10</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program0/program.html\">\r\n  Computing Infrastructure\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Prohibited</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #1 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#1</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/10</td><td align=\"center\">4/22</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program1/program.html\">\r\n  Simple Scripts\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Required</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Debugger #2 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#2</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/22</td><td align=\"center\">4/24</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program2/program.html\">\r\n  The Debug Perspective in Eclipse\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Prohibited</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #3 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#3</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">4/24</td><td align=\"center\">5/1</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program3/program.html\">\r\n  Intermediate Scripts\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Required</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #4 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#4</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">5/1</td><td align=\"center\">5/13</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program4/program.html\">\r\n  Functions and Control Structures\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Required</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #5 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#5</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">5/13</td><td align=\"center\">5/22</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program5/program.html\">\r\n  List Processing\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #6 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#6</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">5/22</td><td align=\"center\">6/4</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program6/program.html\">\r\n  Dictionary and Set Processing\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #7\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#7</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">5/30</td><td align=\"center\">6/7</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program6/program.html\">\r\n</a>\r\n  Classes\r\n<td>Prohibited</td>\r\n ------->\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\">\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
