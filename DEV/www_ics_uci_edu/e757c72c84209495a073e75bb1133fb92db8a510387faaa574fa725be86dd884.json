The total volume of world trade today is around $7 trillion each year. Regardless of a\ncountry's resources, no country can produce all of the goods and services demanded by\nits citizens. For people of Russia, they have to stand in long lines for necessary daily\nproducts because the country's lack of resources. Thus, the Russian state's economic\npolicies try to integrate the country into a prosperous economy by\nopening its doors to foriegn trade activities.<A \nHREF=\"http://www.globeandmail.ca/tuneup08.html\">Foreign investments</A> are \nconsidered to be the\nmain source of money to restructure the former socialist economy. Doing\ninternational business is extrememly risky, a company should understand the legal\naspects in foreign investment, which kind of managerial style is best for the company\nand what are the government regulations being imposed upon the business. These are\nthe questions we need to consider when attempting to extend businesses abroad.<BR>\n<P>\n<STRONG>Business Management</STRONG><BR>\nThe success of any firm depends largely on how well that firm is managed. And to \n<A HREF=\"http://www.miis.edu/im_mba.html\">manage</A> a firm well, managers must \nplan, organize, lead and control. What makes\ninternational business so challenging is the fact that these basic responsibilities are\nmuch more difficult to accomplish in an international context. It is best to find\nlicensed broker to operate in Russian market. <A \nHREF=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu:8001/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/jdg/www/invest_brokers.html\">\nBrokers</A> are licensed and governed by\nthe Ministry of Finace of Russia;therefore, they can guide companies through any\nconfusions and problems. The brokers offer safe-keeping services to their clients. The\nbrokers offer a nominee ownership registration and settlement of transactions on\nbehalf of a client; however, there are difficulties in the maintenance of monetary\naccounts with brokers. According to the Russian legislation only banks have an\nofficial right to keep monetary accounts and organize monetary settlement for all\ntypes of transactions (Rinaco, 1994). Companies can choose between two ways of\ncarrying out their investment activities in Russia. They can either establish a\nregistered permanent representative office or a branch in Russia, or work without\nsuch an office or branch. The second option is that operations in Russia are done\neither through the intermediary organization or through the authorized person.<BR>\n<P>\nBut first a firm must decide how much involvement they want their business \nin the country. Because different levels of involvement in international \nbusiness require different kinds of organizational structure. <BR>\n<UL>\n<LI>Independent Agents \n<LI>licensing \n<LI>Branch Offices \n<LI>Strategic Alliances and Franchising \n<LI><A \nHREF=\"http://akebono.stanford.edu/yahoo/Business/Corporations/Financial_Services/Investment_Services/\">Direct \nInvestment</A> <LI>Global Business \n</UL>\nThe most recommended one is strategic alliances and franchising and sometimes it is\ncalled <EM>joint ventures</EM>. An international strategic alliance is a foreign \ncompany that\nfinds a partner in the country who would like to begin a business together. Instead of\njust licensing this partner, each party to the alliance agrees to put an approximately\nequal amount of resources and capital into a new business. The parent company\nsupplies the business expertise, business knowledge, and brand name. Local investors\nsupply the capital, local contacts, and understanding of the local market.<BR> \n<P>\n<STRONG>Government Regulation</STRONG><BR>\nGovernment regulates business for variety of reasons, the two most important of\nwhich are to protect competition and to meet the nation's social goals. According to\nRussian's foreign person, legal or natural, has the right to invest in Russian\nenterprises, to buy or to sell Russian securities and repatriate profit from Russia after\npayment of appropriate taxes. Nevertheless, legislation governing foreign investment\nis undeveloped and exists in a very primitive and basic form (Rinaco, 1994). There is\na tendency for a large number of violations and infringements to occur when the\ngovernemnt try to carry out the <A HREF=\"http://www.spb.su/rulesreg/govern.html\">liberalization of \nforeign economic activities</A>. \nThere might be practices of illegal competition, and failure to return the specified earning\ninto the country from export operations. It is easy to acknowledge that establish\ncapitalism in Russia is not easy. Indeed, the list of potential problems are staggering.\nThey lack all or most of the following:<BR> \n<UL>\n<LI>Laws that protect private property and guide the establishemnt of contracts. \n<LI>Standardized <A HREF=\"http://anet.scu.edu.au/ANetHomePage.html\">accounting</A> \nprocedures <LI><A HREF=\"http://www.worldbank.org/\">Banks</A> \n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.emi.net/financial_market.html\">Stock and bond markets</A> \n<LI><A HREF=\"http://www.fe.msk.ru/infomarket/rtsb/ewelcome.html\">Convertible \ncurrency</A>(currency that can be exchanged for the currencies of\n   other countries) \n</UL>\nMoreover, continued <A HREF=\"http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/127.html\">political \nand economic turmoil in Russia</A> has led to a pattern in\nwhich many internal laws, <A HREF=\"http://www.spb.su/rulesreg/export.html\">tariff regulations</A>, and \n<A HREF=\"http://www.spb.su/rulesreg/decree1.html\">restrictions on foreign trade</A> are here today and \ngone tomorrow (Ebert, 1994).<BR> <P>\n<STRONG>Strategies for Success</STRONG><BR>\nSuccess in exporting doesn't come overnight. But following a few simple steps can\ncertainly help to increase a firm's chances. Experts suggest the following plan for\nbusinesses that want to start exporting (Griffin, 1994).<BR> \n<P>\n1.<EM>Establish export potential</EM>. To <A HREF=\"http://www.spb.su/rulesreg/decree1.html\">export</A> \nsuccessfully, firms need to know how well\ntheir products will stack up against competitors. The <A \nHREF=\"http://www.doc.gov/CommerceHomePage.html\">U.S. \nCommerce Department</A> helps companies obtain this information through its Export Qualifier Program. The\nprogram provides a computer analysis of a company's organizational and product\nstrengths and compares those factors to characteristics associated with successful\nexporters.<BR>\n<P>\n2.<EM>Develop a marketing plan</EM>. Once export potential is established, exporters \nmust\ndevelop a <A HREF=\"http://www.trinet.com/allen.html\">marketing</A> plan. Research \nabout culture, customs, language, and currency is essential.<BR>\n<P>\n3.<EM>Arrange financing</EM>. International business investments usually requires a \nlarge\nstart-up cost. Arranging for <A \nHREF=\"http://apollo.co.uk/a/International_Funding/\">loans</A> \nto finance foreign ventures was a major stumbling\nblock for many new companies. Many state agencies can help businesses obtain loans\nto <A HREF=\"http://gnn.com/gnn/meta/finance/index.html\">finance</A> international \nbusiness activities.<BR> <P>\n4.<EM>Assemble a distribution system</EM>. Shipping and distrubuting to foreign \nmarkets can be\ncomplicated. Some companies work successfully with distributors and agents in\nforeign countries. Another option is using an international export management\ncompany or freight forwarding company that will handle all the paperwork and keep\nits customers advised.<BR>\n<P>\n5.<EM>Protect Revenues</EM>. Transferring money internationally involves letters of \ncredit and\nbank drafts. To minimize risk on the international front, firms should avoid selling in\ncountries experiencing political or social upheaval.<BR>\n<P>\n<STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG><BR>\nThe subject of International Business has been affected by the World Wide Web in a\npositive way. Information are exchanged between countries and this is an effecient\nway for them to retrieve sources from variety of places. World Wide Web provides\nan overview about the international market for people who are interested in foreign\ninvestment. Also it can act as a guide to students because business activity in a country\nis a good indicator of its economy.<BR> \n</body>\n</html>\nSubmitted March 03, 1995 for ICS 1C \n", "encoding": "ascii"}
