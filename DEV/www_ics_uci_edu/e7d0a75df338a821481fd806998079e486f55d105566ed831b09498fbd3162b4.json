We will read research\npapers and discuss attacks and defenses against operating systems,\nsoftware, network protocols, mobile devices, machine learning, sensors, and \nemerging IoT/CPS systems such as smart home, self-driving cars and smart traffic \nlight. Students\nwill be prepared for research in computer security and learn to make\nconnections to other areas. They will gain\nhands-on experience evaluating and designing secure systems.</p>\n\n<h2>Tentative Topic List<br>\n</h2>\n\n<p>There will be many opportunities to tailor the course to your\nbackgrounds and interests.  The tentative list of topics below should\ngive you an idea of what to expect. See\nthe <a href=\"readings.html\">schedule and reading list</a> for additional details.  Please\nget in touch if you have questions or suggestions.\n\n</p><small></small>\n\n<h2>Grading</h2>\n\nThere will be no exams.  Instead, your grade will be based on the\nfollowing:\n\n\n\n<p><b><a href=\"readings.html\" target=\"_top\">Paper Summary </a>(10%)</b> \u2013 You \nwill read one paper each class. You are required to write a short summary and offer critical comments\nfor each paper.  I'll look for evidence that you read\nthe paper and thought carefully about the topic. The summaries are due at\nthe beginning of class.</p>\n\t\t<p><a href=\"readings.html\" target=\"_top\"><b>Discussion Participation</b></a><b>\n(15%)</b> \u2013 We will discuss the papers you read in class. Come prepared to \n\t\tdiscuss their strength/weakness and make substantive intellectual \n\t\tcontributions. You can sign up to be the discussion lead to claim extra \n\t\tpoints.</p>\n\n<p><b><a target=\"_top\" href=\"attacks_and_tools.html\">Attack and Tool Presentation</a>\n(25%)</b>\n&ndash; Choose an attack/vulnerability/exploit and a tool from the\nprovided list and explain it and/or demo it in class. In a 10-15 minute\npresentation, explain the basic background, how the attack works, demo\nit (when possible), relate it to our daily life, and discuss possible\ndefense/solution.&nbsp; Introduce a tool to show what it can do and how\nthe tool works behind the scene. Give a demo on how to use the tool.\nPresentations will\ntake place throughout the semester per the course schedule.</p>\n\n<p><b><a target=\"_top\" href=\"project.html\">Research Project</a>\n(50%)</b>\n&ndash; You will conduct a research project during\nthe quarter, with the goal of writing a publishable workshop paper.\nStudents are encouraged to work in a small group of size 2 to 3.\nHowever, individual project is allowed and the output will be\nconsidered corresponding to that. Typical project topics involve\nanalyzing the\nsecurity of a system, developing a new security mechanism, or re-implementing or \nadapting an existing attack/defense.</p>\n\n\n<h2>Ethics, Law, and University Policies</h2>\n\nPlease respect the rights and privacy of others. \nBe aware that Federal and state laws criminalize computer intrusion and wiretapping.\nYou can be expelled by the university and arrested if you violate the policies and laws. When in doubt, consult me or \n\t\ta lawyer.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nComputer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)<br>\nElectronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)<br>\n<a href=\"http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/7000470/ElectronicCommunications\">University of California Electronic Communications Policy</a><br>\n</div>\n  \n</body></html>\n", "encoding": "utf-8"}
