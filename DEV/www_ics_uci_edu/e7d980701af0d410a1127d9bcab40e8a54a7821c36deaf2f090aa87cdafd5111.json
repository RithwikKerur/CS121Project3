In the foreseeable future,\ncars will have the ability to communicate with one another in order to\nbetter coordinate their motion. This motivates a number of interesting\nalgorithmic problems. One of the most challenging aspects of traffic\ncoordination involves traffic intersections. In this paper we consider a\nsimple and fundamental geometric optimization problem involving\ncoordinating the motion of vehicles through an intersection. We are\ngiven a set of $n$ vehicles in the plane, each modeled as a unit length\nline segment that moves monotonically, either horizontally or\nvertically, subject to a maximum speed limit. Each vehicle is described\nby a start and goal position and a start time and deadline. The question\nis whether, subject to the speed limit, there exists a collision-free\nmotion plan so that each vehicle travels from its start position to its\ngoal position prior to its deadline. We present two results. We begin by\nshowing that this problem is $\\mathsf{NP}$-complete with a reduction from\n3-SAT. Second, we consider a constrained version in which cars traveling\nhorizontally can alter their speeds while cars traveling vertically\ncannot. We present a simple algorithm that solves this problem in\n$O(n\\log n)$ time.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00874\">a paper by Philip Dasler and David M.
