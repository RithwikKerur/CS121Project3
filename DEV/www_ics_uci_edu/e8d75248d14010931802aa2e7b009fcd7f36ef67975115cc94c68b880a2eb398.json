Each face of his\npolyhedron is a hexagon (none of them is a regular hexagon).  The \npolyhedron shares with the tetrahedron the property that each of \nits faces touches all the other faces.  A tetrahedron demonstrates\nthat four colors are necessary for a map on a surface topologically\nequivalent to a sphere; the Szilassi polyhedron demonstrates that \nseven colors are necessary for a map on a surface topologically\nequivalent to a torus.  (Neither polyhedron demonstrates anything \nabout how many colors are sufficient.)\n \ntetrahedron:            4 faces     4 vertices     6 edges    0 holes\nSzilassi polyhedron:    7 faces    14 vertices    21 edges    1 hole\n \nWhat other kinds of polyhedron could have the property that each pair\nof faces shares an edge?  Probably none.  Euler's formula f + v - e = 2\nis easily generalized for polyhedra with one or more holes; if h is the\nnumber of holes, f + v - e = 2 - 2*h.  \n \nIn a polyhedron every pair of whose faces shares an edge, f and e are \nrelated by the equation e = f * (f - 1) / 2.  \n \nIn a polyhedron every pair of whose faces shares an edge, each vertex \nmust be at the intersection of three edges.  (If there were more than \nthree, some of the faces couldn't share an edge.)  Thus, as each edge \nconnects two vertices, v = e * 2 / 3.\n \nCombining the above equations and simplifying gives \n \n    h = (f*f - 7*f + 12) / 12\n \nwhich can be factored as\n \n    h = (f - 4) * (f - 3) / 12\n \n..  Only certain values of f yield whole numbers of holes.  f=4 applies\nto the tetrahedron; f=7 applies to the Szilassi polyhedron.  The next\nvalue of f that yields a whole value for h is 12, which would apply to \na polyhedron with 12 faces, 66 edges, 44 vertices, and 6 holes.  I find\nit inconceivable that such a polyhedron could exist, and higher values \nof f and h seem even less likely.  Obviously I'm a bit short of a \nrigorous proof, but you get the picture.\n\nSzilassi gave a set of equations that describe a particular instance of\n7-sided toroidal polyhedron; Martin Gardner reproduced patterns for the\nfaces in his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American (Nov. 1978).\n\nIf any of this interests you, and in particular if you would like \npatterns for making models of a Szilassi polyhedron, let me know.  \nI have software I'd be glad to share which lets you play around \nwith the angles and proportions of the polyhedron.\n\nTom Ace\n<A HREF=\"mailto:crux@qnet.com\">tea@netcom.com</A>\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           Laura Helen &lt;email address removed by request of LH&gt;\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Szilassi polyhedron\n<B>Date:</B>           Sun, 5 May 1996 09:29:04 -0700\n<B>Organization:</B>   University of California, Los Angeles\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nOn Sat, 4 May 1996, Tom Ace wrote:\n\n&gt; In 1977, the Hungarian mathematician Lajos Szilassi found a way to \n&gt; construct a seven sided toroidal polyhedron.  \n\nIf you exchange faces and vertices, this is the inverse of a torus with\n7 vertices, 21 edges and 14 faces.  \n\nTo find polyhedra with each face sharing an edge one can invert polyhedra\nwith each vertex sharing an edge.  \n\nLooking for polyhedra with each vertex sharing an edge, this \nis combinatorially satisfied by a polyhedron with 9 vertices,\n36 edges and 24 faces with Euler characteristic -3 -- it is non-orientable.\nThis looks like:\n\n  1  2  3\n  1  2  4\n  1  3  5\n  1  4  6\n  1  5  7\n  1  6  8\n  1  7  9\n  1  8  9\n  2  3  6\n  2  4  5\n  2  5  7\n  2  6  9\n  2  7  8\n  2  8  9\n  3  5  8\n  3  6  7\n  3  7  9\n  3  4  8\n  3  4  9\n  4  5  9\n  4  6  7\n  4  7  8\n  5  6  8\n  5  6  9\nV=9, EC=-3,F=24,E=36\n\nThere is an orientable such polyhedron with 12 vertices, 66 edges and\n44 faces:\n\n  1  2  3\n  1  2  4\n  1  3  5\n  1  4  6\n  1  5  7\n  1  6  8\n  1  7  9\n  1  8 10\n  1  9 11\n  1 10 12\n  1 11 12\n  2  3  6\n  2  4  5\n  2  5  8\n  2  6  7\n  2  7  9\n  2  8 11\n  2  9 12\n  2 10 11\n  2 10 12\n  3  5  8\n  3  6 11\n  3  8  9\n  3  9 10\n  3  4 10\n  3  4 12\n  3  7 11\n  3  7 12\n  4  5  9\n  4  6 10\n  4  9 11\n  4  7 11\n  4  7  8\n  4  8 12\n  5  7 12\n  5  9 10\n  5 10 11\n  5  6 11\n  5  6 12\n  6  7 10\n  6  8  9\n  6  9 12\n  7  8 10\n  8 11 12\nV=12, F=44, E=66, EC=-10, orientable \n\nThis may even be embeddable in 3-space.

It was\nmade and and given to me by my late colleague Derrick Breach,  who alas died\nsuddenly the other day.  He also constructed what's been said to be one of\nthe world's most complete sets of (cardboard) solids - regular, Archimedean, \nJohnson, stellated, compound, and many many others.  Anyone who likes can see \nthem on display here at Canterbury NZ - perhaps on your way through while \ncollecting your chocolate fish credits!      Derrick will be sorely missed.\n\nBut getting back to the Szilassi polyhedron - it's very nice.  The faces\ncome in three pairs of congruents, and another; so the whole thing has a \nneat skew-symmetry.  The six paired faces are all nonconvex hexagons, and\nthe other one is convex and almost regular - it's a rectangle with two\nopposite truncated corners on my model, though I might guess it could be\nmade regular by distorting the others a bit more.     Cool.\n\n|&gt; I have software I'd be glad to share which lets you play around \n|&gt; with the angles and proportions of the polyhedron.\n\nOh great.

Only certain values of f yield whole numbers of holes. \n\nYes, the whole Heawood formula thing is fascinating, both mathematically\nand historically.  When Kempe produced his false proof of the 4-color\ntheorem, (ca 1886), it took a year for someone to notice it was wrong.\nThat someone was Heawood, and ironically, the very paper where he announced\nthe error, contained his formula, which was given as an equation, ALSO in error!\n(He'd in fact proved an inequality, but didn't notice his logical lacuna.)\n\nIt took all of TEN (!) years for someone to notice THIS error. It was Tietche,\nwho proved the equation correctly, produced examples for up to (I think) 6\nholes, and extended it to non-orientable surfaces.  As far as I know there\nwas no actual error in *his* paper - but:  The Heawood formula, though then\nknown to be correct, was still only known to be applicable as a sufficient\nbut NOT necessary bound on the number of colors - there could not be MORE\nthan the Heawood number of colors required, but there may be less.  The Tietche\npaper with examples, tended (by silence) to imply it was nec &amp; suff. Finally,\nin 1930 odd, Franklin proved that the Klein bottle, though having Heawood number\n7, in fact only ever required 6 colors.  This paper is very easy to follow,\nand a tour-de-force in simple chromatic combinatorics.\n\nThere were NO errors, even implied, in the Franklin paper.  But oddly, it led\nto an error in mathemnatical folklore!  Thuswise.  Because the Klein exception\nwas the only one known for so long, it became \"well-known\" that the Heawood\nformula had been proved nec-&amp;-suff for ALL other cases.  This was mentioned\nto me by my own lecturer as fact, in fact; I recall it very well. That was in\n1965, when in fact it was NOT YET KNOWN to be so!  (My old lecturer is still\nhere on the staff with me - I never fail to remind him of this gaff when\nappropriate!  :)  )  It wasn't completely proved till Ringel &amp; Young tidied\nit all up in a series of papers in the late 60's.   Klein is the sole oddity!\n\nPhew!!\n\n|&gt;   The next\n|&gt; value of f that yields a whole value for h is 12, which would apply to \n|&gt; a polyhedron with 12 faces, 66 edges, 44 vertices, and 6 holes.\n\nYes; I took years of odd moments of time, constructing my own dodecahedral\nholocontiguous hexatoroidal map.   Great fun.   Later I found a fun way to\nconstruct new maps from olds, using man-machine interaction.  As always,\nof course, the real fun was in the programming rather than the results.\n\nOne other thing I *did* do by hand, though, was to find a fully symmetric map\nof this type.  It's neatly modellable on either a dodecahedron with 6 (bent)\ntubes going between opposite faces, or a cube with six tubes going between\nopposite edges.  Way cool!  I have models in my office if anyone wants to see.\n\n|&gt;   I find it inconceivable that such a polyhedron could exist,\n\n(For those who've forgotten what I'm waffling about, Tom means a polyhedron with\n 12 (possibly nonconvex) faces, all touching all, with Euler characteristic -10.)\n\nI would have said so too, once.  \n\nHowever, the existence &amp; shape of the Szilassi polyhedron, combined with my \nown fully symmetric simple-tube model, now suggests to me that it may well be\npossible!
