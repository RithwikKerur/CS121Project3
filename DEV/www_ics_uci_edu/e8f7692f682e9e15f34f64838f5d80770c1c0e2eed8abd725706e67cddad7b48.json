Transparencies in the final\npresentation may be hand written if neatly done. Transparencies should be turned in after\nthe presentation. Grading is both on the content and the quality of the oral presentation.</p>\n\n<h4>Purpose and Content</h4>\n\n<p>The purpose of this exercise is to convince your client that you can effectively\ncomplete the project they have described. Effectiveness means that you can elicit further\nrequirements from them and reach a mutual agreement. The project bid should convince the\nhearers (primarily me) that your team has a good understanding of the problem, are\nanticipating questions to elicit further requirements from the client, have a rough idea\nof the process or lifecycle you will follow (remember process and lifecycle diagrams from\nICS 121), have an idea of how you will test the project (perhaps an &quot;acceptance\ntest&quot; or initial ideas about it), have an idea of the kinds of technology you will\nemploy, and, finally, that your team members provide a sufficient mix of skills and\nexperience.</p>\n\n<h4>Comments</h4>\n\n<p>Projects often begin vaguely. Clients do not have complete ideas about the work that\nshould be done. They may not fully anticipate their needs. Therefore your project bid will\nnot be exact. You will have to guess about some aspects of the project. You will have to\nstruggle with ambiguities and uncertainties. The point however is to demonstrate that you\nhave tried to understand the problem as best as possible and have begun to think about the\nentire project lifecycle.</p>\n\n<p>You should already have contacted the potential client. I will ask about this at the\npresentation. Remember, it is best to select one person from the team to coordinate with\nthe (potential) client.</p>\n\n<p>You might think back to ICS 121 Assignment 3: Lifecycle Considerations and Validation. </p>\n\n<hr ALIGN=\"CENTER\">\n\n<p><a HREF=\"assignments.html\">ICS125 WQ00 Assignments<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"../ics125.html\">ICS125 WQ00<br>\n</a><a HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~redmiles\">David F.
