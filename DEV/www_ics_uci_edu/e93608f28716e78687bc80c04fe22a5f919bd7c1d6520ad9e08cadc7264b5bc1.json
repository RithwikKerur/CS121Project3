Simpson, Kim Wong, Shaun D. Jackman, Jacqueline E. Schein, Steven J.M. Jones, and Inanc Birol\n<h2> Presented by Kiran Shivaram, UCIrvine</h2>\n\n\n<p>\n\nWidespread adoption of massively parallel deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing instruments has prompted the recent\n\ndevelopment of de novo short read assembly algorithms. A common shortcoming of the available tools is their inability to\n\nefficiently assemble vast amounts of data generated from large-scale sequencing projects, such as the sequencing of individual\n\nhuman genomes to catalog natural genetic variation. To address this limitation, we developed ABySS (Assembly By\n\nShort Sequences), a parallelized sequence assembler. As a demonstration of the capability of our software, we assembled\n\n3.5 billion paired-end reads from the genome of an African male publicly released by Illumina, Inc. Approximately\n\n2.76 million contigs $100 base pairs (bp) in length were created with an N50 size of 1499 bp, representing 68% of the\n\nreference human genome. Analysis of these contigs identified polymorphic and novel sequences not present in the human\n\nreference assembly, which were validated by alignment to alternate human assemblies and to other primate genomes.\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
