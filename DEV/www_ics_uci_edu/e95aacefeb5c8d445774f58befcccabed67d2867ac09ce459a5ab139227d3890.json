The topic can be related to another course\nyou are taking, your major, or the content of this class.\nAn annotated guide to Web resources in an academic/scholarly area\nis one type of reasonable research paper.\n\nHere's the overall time-line:\n\n  21-28 February: Consider what topic you want to choose and get at\n     least 5 distinct sites from which you can get suitable information.\n     Prepare a proposal consisting of 50 to 100 words describing the\n     scope of your paper and 5 of the references you will use.  Check\n     with ics1c@ics.uci.edu or Franklin and Frost if you have questions\n     about the appropriateness of a topic or want suggestions.\n  27-28 February: In lab, submit your proposal using\n       <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/hw4a.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/doc/hw4a.html</A>\n     Suggestion: Use pico or another text editor to create\n     your proposal and then cut-and-paste into the form provided.\n  1-7 March: Proposals on display for members of the class so that\n     they can offer comments and propose questions for you to address.\n  15 March: Final project due by start of class 11 a.m.\n\nTeam/joint papers are acceptable with 2 to 4 people collaborating.\nAll participants and their roles should be identified in the proposal.\n\nGrading will be on the basis of content and presentation\n(including appropriate use of the technology).\nThe choice of topic is a critical part of this project.\nThe characterization of it as \"academic/scholarly\" is deliberate.\nTecho-toy gee-whiz stuff is fun, but not what is expected here.\n\nIn choosing your topic and writing the proposal (one could almost call\nit an abstract written before the paper), imagine that the audience\nwill be a faculty member, parent, or fellow student who is skeptical\nthat all this \"network computer stuff\" has substantive content beyond \nnumber-crunching, network-cruising, chat-line, game playing.\n\n-- sdf\nStephen Franklin\nICS 1C Instructor\n</PRE>\n<!--X-MsgBody-End-->\n<!--X-Follow-Ups-->\n<!--X-Follow-Ups-End-->\n<!--X-References-->\n<!--X-References-End-->\n<!--X-BotPNI-->\n<HR>\n<UL>\n<LI>Prev: <STRONG><A HREF=\"msg00019.html\">Review Session for Quiz #3</A></STRONG></LI>\n<LI>Next: <STRONG><A HREF=\"msg00017.html\">Some sample questions</A></STRONG></LI>\n<LI>Index: <STRONG><A HREF=\"maillist.html#00018\">Mail Index</A></STRONG></LI>\n</UL>\n<!--X-BotPNI-End-->\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
