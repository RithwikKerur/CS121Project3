The recent Italian Data Protection \nAct (no. 675 of 31.12.1996) regards privacy protection as a part of a \nlarger whole-taking also account of guidelines already included in \nthe European Directive of 1995: indeed, personal data are to be \nprocessed \"by respecting the rights, fundamental freedoms and dignity \nof natural persons, in particular with regard to privacy and personal \nidentity\". Thus, privacy becomes a fundamental component of the \n\"electronic citizenship\" which will be a basic features of the next \nmillennium.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">This ambitious target cannot be achieved solely \nthrough an Act ensuring a high level of protection to citizens: \npowerful social legitimation is also required.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The level of protection ensured by the Italian Act \nis considerable. This is partly due to the fact that Parliament chose \nto include, from the very beginning, significant provisions of the EU \nDirective into domestic legislation; hence, the protection of \npersonal data processed in Italy is, at least currently, in many \ninstances greater than that ensured by countries in which this is \nlong-standing practice.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Social legitimation also results from the fact \nthat the supervisory authority is direct, exclusive expression of \nParliamentary activity. The four members of the Supervisory Authority \n(i.e., the \"Garante\") for Personal Data Protection are elected by \nboth Houses, and the chairman is, in turn, elected by the members. \nThis means that no undue pressure 1s exercised by Government, which \nobviously enhances the independence of the authority. Further, being \ndirectly linked to popular sovereignty - through the election by \nParliament - the authority is especially qualified to carry out \nactivities which are aimed, firstly and above all, at protecting \nvalues and fundamental rights to which all citizens are entitled.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Thus, the Garante is not entrusted exclusively \nwith the task of monitoring or auditing data hanks: in fact, it has \nconsiderable power of action, including data hanks to which no \nsupervision usually applies (see Article 4). This is the case, for \ninstance, of intelligence services, which may not dismiss the \nrequests made by the Garante on grounds of State secrecy - as is \noften the case in respect of similar requests made by judicial \nauthorities.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">The Garante is also committed the difficult task \nof striking a balance between diverging interests. This is apparent \nas regards the relationships between privacy and freedom of the \npress, hut also applies to other matters - such as sensitive data; \nprocessing of such data is allowed only with the data subject's \nconsent <U>and</U> with the authorization by the Garante.</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Act no. 675 is accompanied by another Act (no. \n676) which provides flexibility and can be said to be a gateway to \nthe future. Self-amendment arrangements are provided for: based on \nthe experience gained in the implementation of the Act, the \nGovernment may issue decrees supplementing and/or amending the Act so \nas to bring the latter fully into line with actual requirements. Two \nsuch decrees have already been issued. Furthermore, the Government \nwas enabled to issue, by the end of 1998, a number of decrees which \nshould allow supplementing the existing legislation in especially \ncomplex areas or in sectors showing innovations due to the \ndevelopment of information and communication technology. This entails \nthe commitment towards laying down provisions applying to the whole \nissue of telematics networks by the term stated - which will prevent \nleaving out the very sectors in which the protection of fundamental \nhuman rights is especially necessary and involves a greater \neffort.</P>\n</FONT><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n</FONT><FONT FACE=\"Times\" SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"right\">IL GARANTE \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>\n</FONT><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">&nbsp;</P>\n<FONT SIZE=5><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\"><B>Table of Contents</B></P>\n</FONT><FONT SIZE=4>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter I&nbsp;&nbsp; - GENERAL PRINCIPLES</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter II&nbsp; - OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE \nCONTROLLER</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter III&nbsp;- PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA</P>\n<DIR>\n<DIR>\n\n</FONT><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Part I - Collection and quality of personal data</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Part II - Data subject&#146;s rights in respect of \ndata processing</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Part III - Security in data processing, \nlimitations on the</P><DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">utilization of data and payment of damages</P></DIR>\n\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Part IV - Communication and dissemination of data</P>\n<FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P></DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter IV&nbsp;&nbsp;- PROCESSING OF SPECIAL \nCATEGORIES OF DATA</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- PROCESSING SUBJECT \nTO SPECIFIC PROVISIONS</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter VI&nbsp;&nbsp;- ADMINISTRATIVE AND \nJUDICIAL REMEDIES</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter VII&nbsp; - SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter VIII - PENALTIES</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter IX&nbsp;&nbsp;- TRANSITIONAL, FINAL AND \nREPEALED PROVISIONS</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"></P></DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n</DIR>\n\n<P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\">Chapter X&nbsp;&nbsp; - FUNDING AND ENTRY INTO FORCE</P>\n</FONT><B><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\"></P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">&nbsp;</P>\n<P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">&nbsp;</P>\n\n<P></B><FONT SIZE=4><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">CHAPTER I</P>\n<P><B><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</P><BR>\n<P><P ALIGN=\"CENTER\">Article 1<BR>\n(</B><I>Purposes and definitions</I><B>)</P>\n<P></B><P ALIGN=\"JUSTIFY\"><B>1</B>.
