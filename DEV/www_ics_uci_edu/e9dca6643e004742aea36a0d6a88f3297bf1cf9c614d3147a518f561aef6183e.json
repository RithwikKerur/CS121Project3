We\ngive the first non-trivial approximation algorithm for\nminimizing the\nmultiplicative distortion. Our algorithm produces an embedding with\ndistortion (c log n)^\\sqrt(O( log delta)), where c is the\noptimal\ndistortion, and delta is the spread of the metric (i.e. the\nratio of the\ndiameter over the minimum distance). We give an improved\nO(1)-approximation algorithm for the case where the input is the\nshortest path metric over an unweighted graph. Moreover, we show that\nby composing our approximation algorithm for embedding general\nmetrics\ninto trees, with the approximation algorithm of [BCIS05] for\nembedding\ntrees into the line, we obtain an improved approximation algorithm\nfor\nembedding general metrics into the line.\n\n<p>\nWe also provide almost tight bounds for the relation between\nembedding\ninto trees and embedding into spanning subtrees. We show that for any\nunweighted graph G, the ratio of the distortion required to embed G\ninto a spanning subtree, over the distortion of an optimal tree\nembedding of G, is at most O(log n). We complement this bound by\nexhibiting a family of graphs for which the ratio is \nOmega(log n/ log log n).\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
