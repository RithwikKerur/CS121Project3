Devanbu, David S. Rosenblum, and Alexander L. Wolf\nin <I>Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Software\nEngineering (ICSE16)</I>, pages 241-250, Sorrento, Italy, May 1994.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nMany software testing and analysis tools manipulate graph representations of\nprograms, such as abstract syntax trees or abstract semantics graphs.\nHand-crafting such tools in conventional programming languages can be\ndifficult, error prone, and time consuming.  Our approach is to use\napplication generators targeted for the domain of graph-representation-based\ntesting and analysis tools.  Moreover, we generate the generators themselves,\nso that the development of tools based on different languages and/or\nrepresentations can also be supported better.  In this paper we report on our\nexperiences in developing a system called Aria that generates testing and\nanalysis tools based on an abstract semantics graph representation for C and\nC++ called Reprise.  Aria itself was generated by the Genoa system.  We\ndemonstrate the utility of Aria and, thereby, the power of our approach, by\nshowing Aria's use in the development of a tool that derives control\ndependence graphs directly from Reprise abstract semantics graphs.\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:19:55 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
