Up to this point, the greatest drawback\nof cuckoo hashing appears to be that there is a polynomially small but\npractically significant probability that a failure occurs during the\ninsertion of an item, requiring an expensive rehashing of all items in\nthe table. In this paper, we show that this failure probability can be\ndramatically reduced by the addition of a very small constant-sized\nstash. We demonstrate both analytically and through simulations that\nstashes of size equivalent to only three or four items yield\ntremendous improvements, enhancing cuckoo hashing's practical\nviability in both hardware and software. Our analysis naturally\nextends previous analyses of multiple cuckoo hashing variants, and the\napproach may prove useful in further related schemes.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
