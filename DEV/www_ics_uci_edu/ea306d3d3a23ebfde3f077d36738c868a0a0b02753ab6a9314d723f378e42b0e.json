This project corresponds to Game Search (Chapter 5 in your book). Your job is to write an AI agent that can beat you at Connect-K, i.e., to write the adversarial search (\u201cgame search\u201d) controller for a video game world. Shells will be available in C++ and Java.  I hope to be able to run a tournament within which your AI controllers will compete against each other for Bonus Points.\r\nA Java shell is available; a C++ shell is available; an example \u201cdumb\u201d game is available; an example \u201csmart\u201d game is available; a Project Specification is available. \r\nA tournament shell is available if you wish to play different versions of your AI against themselves to refine your evaluation function.\r\nYou are required to form project teams of two students. It is not possible to have one-person project teams.\r\nPlease follow the \u201cPair Programming\u201d paradigm. One person types the code while the other looks over their shoulder, and they switch roles frequently.\r\n________________________________________\r\nStudy Guides --- Previous CS-271 Quizzes, Mid-term, and Final exams:\r\nPrevious CS-271 Quizzes, Mid-term exams, and Final exams are available here as study guides.\r\nAs an incentive to study this material, at least one question from a previous Quiz or Exam will appear on every new Quiz or Exam. In particular, questions that many students missed are likely to appear again. If you missed a question, please study it carefully and learn from your mistake --- so that if it appears again, you will understand it perfectly.\r\nWinter Quarter 2013:\r\nQuiz #1 and key\r\nQuiz #2 and key\r\nMid-term Exam and key\r\nQuiz #3 and key\r\nFall Quarter 2011:\r\nQuiz #1 and key\r\nQuiz #2 and key\r\nQuiz #3 and key\r\nQuiz #4 and key \r\nMid-term Exam and key\r\nFinal Exam and key\r\nFall Quarter 2010:\r\nQuiz #1 and key\r\nQuiz #2 and key\r\nQuiz #3 and key\r\nQuiz #4 and key\r\nMid-term Exam and key\r\nFinal Exam and key\r\nSpring Quarter 2010:\r\nMid-term Exam key\r\nFinal Exam key\r\n[No Quizzes; Homeworks were given instead.]\r\n________________________________________\r\nOnline Resources: \r\nAdditional Online Resources may be posted as the class progresses.\r\n Textbook website for Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (AIMA).\r\n\tAIMA page for additional online resources.\r\nAmerican Association for Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) website.\r\n\tAAAI \u201cAI Topics.\u201d\r\n\tAAAI \u201cStudent Resources.\u201d\r\n\tAAAI \u201cClassic Papers.\u201d\r\n\tAAAI Annual Conference.\r\n\tAAAI\u2019s digital library of more than 10,000 AI technical papers\r\n\tAAAI\u2019s AI Magazine\r\n\tAAAI\u2019s Author Kit\r\nMuch of the text for the HAL book .\r\nWell worth looking at to get a broad and entertaining view of the history of AI.\r\n________________________________________\r\nAcademic Honesty: \r\nAcademic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at the University of California, Irvine. It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with UCI's current academic honesty policies. Please take the time to read the current UCI Senate Academic Honesty Policies and the ICS School policy on cheating.\r\nThe policies in these documents will be adhered to scrupulously. Any student who engages in cheating, forgery, dishonest conduct, plagiarism, or collusion in dishonest activities, will receive an academic evaluation of ``F'' for the entire course, with a letter of explanation to the student's permanent file. The ICS Student Affairs Office will be involved at every step of the process. Dr. Lathrop seeks to create a level playing field for all students. \r\n________________________________________\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
