Dwyer, Lori A. Clarke and Kari A. Nies in Technical Report 94-046,\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1994.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nThis paper presents a compact Petri net representation that is efficient \nto construct for concurrent programs that use explicit tasking and \nrendezvous style communication. These Petri nets are based on task \ninteraction graphs and are called TIG-based Petri nets. (TPNs).  They \nform a compact representation by abstracting large regions of program \nexecution with associated summary information that is necessary for \nperforming program analysis.  We present a flexible framework for checking \na variety of properties of concurrent programs using the reachability \ngraph generated from a TPN. We present experimental results that \ndemonstrate the benefit of TPNs over alternate Petri net representations \nand discuss the applicability of Petri net reduction techniques to TPNS.\n\n<P>\n\n[To appear in \"Proceedings of the Seventeenth International Conference on \nSoftware Engineering,\" April 1995.]\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Thu Jan 26 13:36:49 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
