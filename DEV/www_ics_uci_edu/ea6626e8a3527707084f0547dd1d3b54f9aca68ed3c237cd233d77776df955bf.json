Our ineptitude in getting at\nthe record is largely caused by the artificiality of systems of\nindexing.  When data of any sort are placed in storage, they are filed\nalphabetically or numerically, and information is found (when it is)\nby tracing it down from subclass to subclass.  It can be in only one\nplace, unless duplicates are used; one has to have rules as to which\npath will locate it, and the rules are cumbersome.  Having found one\nitem, moreover, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter on a\nnew path.\n\n<p>\n\nThe human mind does not work that way. It operates by association.\nWith one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is\nsuggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some\nintricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.  It has\nother characteristics, of course; trails that are not frequently\nfollowed are prone to fade, items are not fully permanent, memory is\ntransitory.  Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the\ndetail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.\n\n<p>\n\nMan cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially,\nbut he certainly ought to be able to learn from it.  In minor ways he\nmay even improve, for his record have relative permanency.  The first\nidea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection.\nSelection by association, rather than by indexing, may yet be\nmechanized.  One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility\nwith which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be\npossible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and\nclarity of the items resurrected from storage.\n\n<p>\n\nConsider a future device for individual use, which is a sort of\nmechanized private file and library.  It needs a name, and to coin\none at random, ``memex'' will do.  A memex is a device in which an\nindividual stores all his books, records, and communications, and\nwhich is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed\nand flexibility.  It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.\n\n<p>\n\nIt consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be operated from a\ndistance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which he works.\nOn the top are slanting translucent screens, on which material can be\nprojected for convenient reading.  There is a keyboard, and sets of\nbuttons and levers.  Otherwise it looks like an ordinary desk.\n\n<p>\n\nIn one end is the stored material.  The matter of bulk is well taken\ncare of by improved microfilm.  Only a small part of the interior of\nthe memex is devoted to storage, the rest to mechanism.  Yet if the\nuser inserted 5000 pages of material a day it would take him hundreds\nof years to fill the repository, so he can be profligate and enter\nmaterial freely.\n\n<p>\n\nMost of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm ready for\ninsertion.  Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals,\nnewspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place.  Business\ncorrespondence takes the same path.  And there is provision for direct\nentry.  On the top of the memex is a transparent <a\nhref=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?platen\">platen</a>.  On\nthis are placed longhand notes, photographs, memoranda, all sort of\nthings.  When one is in place, the depression of a lever causes it to\nbe photographed onto the next blank space in a section of the memex\nfilm, dry photography being employed.\n\n<p>\n\nThere is, of course, provision for consultation of the record by the\nusual scheme of indexing.  If the user wishes to consult a certain\nbook, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the book\npromptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing\npositions.  Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom\nconsults his code book; but when he does, a single tap of a key\nprojects it for his use.  Moreover, he has supplemental levers.  On\ndeflecting one of these levers to the right he runs through the book\nbefore him, each page in turn being projected at a speed which just\nallows a recognizing glance at each.  If he deflects it further to the\nright, he steps through the book 10 pages at a time; still further at\n100 pages at a time.  Deflection to the left gives him the same\ncontrol backwards.\n\n<p>\n\nA special button transfers him immediately to the first page of the\nindex.  Any given book of his library can thus be called up and\nconsulted with far greater facility than if it were taken from a\nshelf.  As he has several projection positions, he can leave one item\nin position while he calls up another.  He can add marginal notes and\ncomments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography,\nand it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus\nscheme, such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad\nwaiting rooms, just as though he had the physical page before him.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Next:</b> <a href=\"section7.html\">Section 7</a>,\n<b>Previous:</b> <a href=\"section5.html\">Section 5</a>,\n<b>Up:</b> <a href=\"index.html\">As We May Think</a>\n<address>dduchier@csi.uottawa.ca</address>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
