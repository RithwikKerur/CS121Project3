We now discuss techniques limited to specific numerators.  The typical question here is how many terms are needed to represent fractions with a given numerator.  For fractions 2/y the answer is clearly 2.  Some fractions 3/y require 3 terms, as we see below.  It is not known whether any fraction 4/y requires 4 terms.\n<P>\nMore generally, good bounds are known on the number of terms needed to represent x/y measured as a function of y\n<A HREF=\"refs.html#Vos85\">[Vos85]</A>, but there seems to be less work on measuring this minimum number of terms as a function only of x.  As we note in the section on 4/y, a solution to this specific case would have implications for the general problem.\n<H3><IMG SRC=\"mmaSubSection.gif\" ALT=\"+\">\nNumerator 3\n</H3>\n<P>\nThe basic result for fractions of the form 3/y is that there is a two-term expansion if and only if y has a factor congruent to 2 mod 3.  Klee and Wagon\n<A HREF=\"refs.html#KW91\">[KW91]</A> credit this result to N. Nakayama; however they supply no citation, so we repeat the proof below.\n<P>\n<B>Theorem:\n</B>3/y has a two-term expansion if and only if y has a factor congruent to 2 mod 3.\n<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Proof:\n</B>In one direction, the representation 3/(3n+2)=1/(n+1)+1/(n+1)(3n+2) is found by both the greedy and continued fraction methods.  This idea can easily be extended to 3/y where y is a multiple of 3n+2.\n\t\t  \nIn the other direction, suppose y=3n+1 and 3/y=1/a+1/b=(a+b)/ab.  First note that a and b must be divisible by the same power of 3, since if a were divisible by 3^i and b by 3^j, with j&gt;i, then a+b would not divisible by 3^j and the powers of 3 wouldn't cancel from the denominator.  Let g=gcd(a,b), u=a/g, v=b/g, so 3/y=(u+v)/guv and 3 divides u+v; let u+v=3z. Then 1/a+1/b=3z/guv and g must factor as zw since gcd(uv,u+v)=1.  So y=uvw. For u+v=3z, one of u and v (say u) must be 2 mod 3, giving the factor of y we seek.\n</BLOCKQUOTE>\t\t  \nUnfortunately this seems to imply that finding short representations, even in this special case, is computationally difficult: at least as difficult as factoring integers.\n<P>\nThe\n<A HREF=\"greed.html#smallnum\">small numerator version of the reverse greedy method</A> (which includes factorization as one of its subroutines) will always find a two-term representation for 3/n when one exists.  Some examples of two-term representations that would not be found by our other general algorithms: 3/25=1/10+1/50; 3/55=1/22+1/110=1/20+1/220; 3/121=1/44+1/484\n<H3><IMG SRC=\"mmaSubSection.gif\" ALT=\"+\">\nNumerator 4\n</H3>\n<P>\nThe question of whether all fractions 4/y have 3-term representations is discussed by Mordell\n<A HREF=\"refs.html#Mor69\">[Mor69]</A>, who attributes it to Erd&ouml;s and Straus.  Guy\n<A HREF=\"refs.html#Guy81\">[Guy81]</A> cites several other authors as having worked on the problem: Bernstein, Obl&aacute;th, Rosati, Shapiro, Straus, Yamamoto, and Franceschine. Others have worked on more general versions of this problem including Schinzel, Sierpinski, Sedl&aacute;cek, Palam&agrave;, Stewart, Webb, Breusch, Graham, and Vaughan. A positive solution to this question would have more general implications: we could use such a solution as the basis for a conflict resolution method that, given a number x/y, would find an Egyptian fraction representation with x^(Log[3]/Log[4]) ~= x^0.7925 terms.\n<H4><IMG SRC=\"mmaSubSubSection.gif\" ALT=\"-\">\nModular Conditions\n</H4>\n<P>\nMordell shows that in any example 4/y requiring 4 terms in an Egyptian fraction representation, y must be 1 mod 24, &#177;1 mod 5, and one of three values mod 7 (giving a total of 6 possible values mod 840, all squares of small numbers).  If y is a minimal counterexample, it must be prime\n(since if y=ab we could divide all terms in a representation of 4/a by b).\n<P>\nIf y is 2 or 3 mod 4, the greedy algorithm gives a 2 or 3 term representation.  If y is 1 mod 4  we have the representation 1/ceil[y/4] + 3/(y ceil[y/4]) where the last term has a 2-term expansion whenever y is 2 mod 3 or 5 mod 8.  So if 4/y is to fail to have a 3 term representation, y must be of the form 24n + 1.  Several methods extend this analysis by representing 4/y when y (equivalently n) has certain values modulo small primes.\n<P>\nThe representations 1/(6n+1) + 3/(24n+1)(6n+1) and 1/(18n+1)(24n+1) + 3/(18n+1) work if one of 6n+1, 18n+1, or 24n+1 is divisible by a prime p congruent to 5 mod 6.  Thus for any of these primes one can derive rules for finding three-term representations of 4/y, that work whenever y has certain values mod p.  We can use this technique to find representations when n is congruent to 4, 3, or 1 mod 5 (and so, rule out counterexamples for y congruent to anything but &#177;1 mod 5).\n<P>\nThe representation 1/(6n+k) + (4k-1)/(6n+k)(24n+1) works via a greedy method if a factor of the second denominator is (4k-2) mod (4k-1), or more generally if the factor is (4k-1-i) mod (4k-1) and i divides the denominator.  In particular these work with k=2 when n is 2, 3, 4, or 6 mod 7\n(with the corresponding values of i being 0, 1, 1, and 2).  Therefore in any counterexample 4/y, y must be a quadratic residue mod 7.\n<P>\nYet another type of rule is possible: consider the decomposition\n1/(6n+k) +a/(6n+k)(24n+1) + b/(6n+k)(24n+1), where a+b = 4k-1.  This is only possible when k is even, since otherwise one of a or b would be even and not divide the denominator.\nFor instance 4/(24n+1)=1/(6n+10) + 26/(6n+10)(24n+1) + 13/(6n+10)(24n+1)\nwhere the last two simplify to unit fractions if n is 7 mod 13.\n<H4><IMG SRC=\"mmaSubSubSection.gif\" ALT=\"-\">\nParticular Values\n</H4>\n<P>\nAs noted above, the numbers y for which 4/y might possibly require four terms fall into six classes modulo 840: 1,  121, 169, 289, 361, and 529.  We only need to consider prime n since if mn is a counterexample, so must be both m and n.  Following are representations for all such cases through 12500.  Most use rules like the ones described above that depend only on the values of y mod 11, 13, and 19, but 4/3361 uses a method that depends on y mod 29 and 4/8089 uses a method that depends on y mod 17.\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/1801 = 1/451 + 1/295364 + 1/3249004\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/2521 = 1/636 + 1/69748 + 1/131876031\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/2689 = 1/676 + 1/139828 + 1/908882\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/3049 = 1/772 + 1/60980 + 1/5884570\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/3361 = 1/841 + 1/974690 + 1/28266010\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/3529 = 1/892 + 1/80726 + 1/569764108\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/3889 = 1/975 + 1/345150 + 1/268457670\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/4201 = 1/1096 + 1/25208 + 1/13237351\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/4561 = 1/1244 + 1/13684 + 1/15603181\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/4729 = 1/1185 + 1/510732 + 1/201739140\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/5209 = 1/1308 + 1/296262 + 1/3086457516\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/5569 = 1/1402 + 1/200484 + 1/140539284\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/5881 = 1/1604 + 1/17644 + 1/25941091\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/6841 = 1/1713 + 1/1065486 + 1/7288989726\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/7681 = 1/1924 + 1/1136788 + 1/7389122\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/8089 = 1/2023 + 1/5775546 + 1/98184282\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/8521 = 1/2324 + 1/25564 + 1/54457711\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/8689 = 1/2175 + 1/1718250 + 1/14929874250\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/8761 = 1/2196 + 1/836676 + 1/3665059218\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/8929 = 1/2233 + 1/7250348 + 1/79753828\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/9241 = 1/2314 + 1/1644898 + 1/10691837\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/9601 = 1/2406 + 1/1008105 + 1/269500070\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/9769 = 1/2452 + 1/614226 + 1/12000747588\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/10369 = 1/2828 + 1/31108 + 1/80639713\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/12049 = 1/3016 + 1/2795368 + 1/18169892\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><B>\n4/12289 = 1/3078 + 1/1644678 + 1/30317171913\n</B></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>\n<P>\nAccording to Guy, N.
