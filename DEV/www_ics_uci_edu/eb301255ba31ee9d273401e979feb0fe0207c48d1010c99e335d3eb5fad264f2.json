I focused on two items:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>There is a difference between education and training. In education, we are\r\n      not looking just for the right answer.\r\n    Instead, we are learning to think critically, to acquire skills, tools,\r\n      and the knowledge to use them, all towards the goal of being able to use\r\n      fundamental principles to find the answers to new, unanswered questions.\r\n<p>\r\n<li>By cheating, real learning/education is undermined.\r\n    One doesn't acquire the educational objectives mentioned above by avoiding\r\n      hard work and just finding and submitting the right answers (even if you\r\n      end-up understanding these answers).\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\nWhat is interesting about this reading is that the author does not say cheating\r\n  is bad because it is unethical (which it is, and the consequences of cheating\r\n  can affect the cheaters and other students in class as well), but he does say\r\n  that cheating is bad becuase it prevents students from acquiring the\r\n  knowledge/experience they came to college to get, not only in the class in\r\n  which they cheat, but in later classes as well.\r\n</body>\r\n</html>", "encoding": "ascii"}
