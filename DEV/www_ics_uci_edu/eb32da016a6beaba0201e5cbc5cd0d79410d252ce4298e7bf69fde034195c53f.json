The issue of tribal sovereignty will \nremain at the forefront for the Indian people and will not just <i>go \naway</i>.\n\n<P>Sovereignty is the right to be \n<A HREF=\"http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?autonomy\"> autonomous</A> \nand have self-determination.  For \nan entire ethnicity of people to be stripped of this right, even though \nthey practiced self-governance before the Europeans and the Spanish \npeople came to the area which is now known as North America, it is only \nright that these people should want to regain their fundamental right to \nmaintain a distinct community.\n\n<P>Through tribal sovereignty, American Indians hold a unique status as \ncitizens.  Not only are they subject to laws and procedures of the United \nStates government, but to tribal governments as well.  An example of this \nis that most Americans have a Social Security number, which is a \nuniversal identifier; whereas an Indian person will not only have a Social \nSecurity number, but have a Census or Tribal Verification \nnumber which identifies that person as a member of a federally recognized tribe\nwithin the United States.\n\n<P>By means of a treaty, the U.S. government took the first steps in \nestablishing a contingent relationship with American Indian tribes.  The \nfirst of such agreements took place during the period of the \nRevolutionary War with the group of tribes known as the\n<A HREF=\"http://nysernet.org/oneida/treaties/1789.html\"> Six Nations of the \nIroquois Confederacy</A>, which include the\n<UL>\n<LI>Mohawks\n<LI>Oneidas\n<LI>Onondagas\n<LI>Tuscaroras\n<LI>Cayugas and\n<LI>Senecas.\n</UL>\nMany of the treaties first stipulated boundary lines of what the \ngovernment had control over, also the alliance between the two agreeing \nparties would prevent the tribes from <i>attacking</i> non-Indians or \nthey would face extreme punishments. An example of the before mentioned \nagreement is the <A \nHREF=\"http://kuhttp.cc.ukans.edu/~marc/geography/northam/canandaigua_treaty.html\n>Pickering Treaty</A> which was drawn up in the hopes that <i>peace</i> \nwould prevail between the United States and the Indian tribes of the Six \nNations.  One of the first tribal entities to establish\n<A HREF=\"http://nysernet.org/oneida/sovereign.html\">sovereignty</A> \nwithin the United States was the <A HREF=\"http://nysernet.org/oneida/\">\nOneida</A> nation.  They have continued to \nhonor their side of the treaty and have remained an ally to the United \nStates.\n\n<P>Previously known as the War Department,the <A \nHREF=\"http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/doi.html\">\nDepartment of the Interior</A> plays an integral role in that it is \nresponsible for public lands that American Indians reside on.  An \nimportant aspect to having tribal sovereignty is having a land base where \nself-governance can occur.  Throughout history, the government has \ndesignated the location and size of the land areas through treaties.  \nAlong the way, the agreements were adjusted or overlooked in various \nsituations to benefit governmental and non-Indian purposes.  Such as:\n<OL>\n<LI>settlers wanting to cross Indian lands to reach <i>untouched areas</i>,\n<LI>to establish settlements for farming, and\n<LI>to have access to valuable resources located on tribal lands.\n</OL>\nThese broken promises are the means by which tribal Indians have rallied \ntogether and have asked the United States government to honor these treaties.\n\n<P>The Indian people have found that by educating themselves in regards to \ntheir own tribal history, they are then better prepared to enter into \ndiscussions with the government.  Individuals who are well-informed \nusually become advocates for their tribes and can succinctly retrace the \nhistory of broken promises.\n\n<P>After five hundred years, the United States government still has not \nseen fit to honor treaties.  However; under the current office of \nPresident Bill Clinton, some remarkable steps have taken place in \nreaffirming past treaties between the U.S. government and Indian \nnations.  In April of 1994, President Clinton invited the tribal leaders \nrepresenting over five hundred tribes throughout the United States to \nWashington D.C. and gave an address <b>\"stating that federally recognized \ntribes have the sovereign authority to interact on a \n<A HREF=\"http://www.tucson.ihs.gov/Docs/GenFolder/IHSFacts.html \">\ngovernment-to-government</A> basis directly with federal agencies.\"</b>\n\n<P>It is unfortunate to realize that after hundreds of years the Indian \npeople still have to make a request to the United States government for \nthe right to self-determination.  It is interesting to ponder how many \nmore years it will take to be granted that request with no stipulations \nattached.  \n\n<hr>\n<H3><b>Resources on Tribal Sovereignty</b></H3>\n<OL>\n<LI>http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/1492.exhibit/c-Columbus/columbus.html \n --  This reference is to Christopher Columbus.\n\n<LI>http://c.gp.cs.cmu.edu:5103/prog/webster?autonomy -- This reference \ncomes from Webster's Dictionary.\n\n<LI>http://nysernet.org/oneida/treaties/1789.html --  This reference \nexplains the Six Nations Treaty of 1789.\n\n<LI>http://nysernet.org/oneida/  -- This reference is for the Oneida \nIndian Nation.\n\n<LI>http://info.er.usgs.gov/doi/doi.html  --  This reference is about the \nU.S. Department of the Interior.\n\n<LI>http://www.tucson.ihs.gov/Docs/GenFolder/IHSFacts.html  -- This \nreference explains relationships between the government and Indian tribes. \n\n<LI><i>\"Stating that federally recognized tribes have the sovereign \nauthority to interact on a government-to-government basis directly with \nfederal agencies\"</i>  --  Quote from President Clinton's address in April \n1994.\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
