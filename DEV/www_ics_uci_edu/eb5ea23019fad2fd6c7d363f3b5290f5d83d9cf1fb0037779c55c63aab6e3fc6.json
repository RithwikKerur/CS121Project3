It is essential that you attend the lecture and lab you're officially enrolled in; the class is too full to accommodate &quot;visiting.&quot; Most of your lab work will be done in pairs,\n  so the scheduled lab times are the best times to\nwork with your partner. Because the labs are mostly full, if you want to change your enrollment from one lab section to another, you need to find a person who wants to make the opposite change and the two of you must go in person to the ICS Student Affairs Office as soon as possible, but definitely before the end of the second week.</p>\n<P>\n<B>Office hours:  </B>You are welcome to drop by my office at any time.  If I'm there and not immersed in something\n    else, I'll be glad to chat about the course material or other topics.\n    I will definitely be in or near my office during these scheduled hours,\n    during which course-related matters will have first priority:  Tuesdays from 12:30 to 1:15 and Wednesdays from 11:30 to 12:20. I may adjust these times at the end of the first week. Of course emergencies\n    may come up, but I will try to give advance notice of any change. I'll\n    also be happy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't skip it  without getting in touch).  The\n    quickest and most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail, as described\nbelow.</P>\n<P>\n<FONT ><B>Questions and announcements:</B>  You can\n get a response to your course-related questions most quickly by posting them at <a href=\"https://piazza.com/uci/winter2014/ics31/home\">Piazza.com</a>.  If you\nneed to reach one of us privately, use our individual IDs listed above. I will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam filters snag a legitmate message. Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet Email address will help your messages get noticed.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n  <FONT >We will also send course announcements by Email\n    to the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email daily.\n    Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar\n    has for you (your UCInet ID).    If you prefer to read your Email\n  on another account, forwarding instructions appear below.</FONT><font > Don&#39;t let this slide; if you miss official\nannouncements, your grade could suffer.</font></P>\n<P>\n<FONT >This course&#39;s web page is at </FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/f12.html\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31</code></A><FONT > and \nofficial course Email is archived at </FONT><A HREF=\"http://eee.uci.edu/\"><code>eee.uci.edu</code></A><FONT >; follow the link on your MyEEE page.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT ><B>Textbooks and software:</B> There are two choices for a textbook this quarter:</FONT></P>\n<ul>\n  <li><FONT >An interactive electronic text, Zyante's Programming in Python 3.3, UCI edition</FONT></li>\n  <li>A traditional textbook, Ljubomir Perkovic's <A HREF=\"http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&itemId=0470618469&bcsId=7001\"><I>Introduction to Computing Using Python: An Application Development Focus.</I></a></li>\n</ul>  \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/refs.html\">course resource page</a> has more information about these alternatives. Neither is technically required, meaning that we won't require specific exercises from either text, but you should have (at least) one of them to supplement what we do in class and lab.</p>\n\n<P>The Python software you need for your work (Python 3.3 and the IDLE environment) is installed on every machine in the ICS labs. Because every lab assignment is done with a partner, you'll do much of your work in the scheduled labs. You are also welcome to install Python on your personal machine; we just have to say that because everyone's computer is configured a little differently, we can't promise to fix the installation problems that may come up on your own machine.<!--\n<P><em><font >Fluency with Information Technology, Second Edition,</font></em><font > by Lawrence Snyder.

See </FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~lab</code></A><FONT >\n  for lab hours and other information.   Note in particular that all ICS labs\nare closed on university holidays (like Martin Luther King Day and Presidents' Day)<!--, such as the Friday after Thanksgiving\n(but not the Saturday and Sunday)-->.</FONT></P>\n<P>\n<FONT >Please remember that programming tasks always\ntake longer to complete than you think they will, no matter how much experience\nyou have.

Thus, comparison of scores between TAs is meaningless.</P>\n<P><FONT >Lab scores will be recorded on the web in the EEE gradebook. We will be happy to correct any errors that do occur, but we\n  must ask that you bring your TA your grading questions within a week after the\n  item is returned; the course moves quickly and we simply can&#39;t deal\n  with assignments long past.</FONT></P>\n<P><FONT >We find that we obtain the fairest grade outcomes overall by not committing in advance to a specific fixed point scale for assigning final letter grades in the course. Thus, no letter grades apply to anything until the end of the course and it is not possible to calculate your letter grade precisely until all the work has been done. Don't ask, &quot;What grade am I getting so far?&quot;; instead ask, &quot;What more can I do to master the material?&quot; We urge everyone to focus not on letter grades but on learning what's necessary to earn high scores; the grades will follow from that.</FONT> You should check the EEE gradebook periodically to make sure your assignment scores have been recorded correctly. EEE also indicates where your score falls compared to other students; if you find yourself in the bottom quarter consistently, talk with your TA or the instructor.</P>\n<P>We're required to say that in unusual circumstances, these policies may change, but we do not expect that to happen.</P>\n<P>\n<FONT ><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the TA or instructor at any time. </FONT></P>\n<P><FONT ><B>What to do this week to get started in ICS 31:  <BR />\n  </B></FONT><FONT  SIZE=4>&mdash;</FONT><FONT > If you do not have a UCInet ID, get one (see </FONT><A HREF=\"http://activate.uci.edu/\"><code>http://activate.uci.edu/</code></A><FONT >). <BR />\n  </FONT><FONT  SIZE=4>&mdash;</FONT><FONT > Learn how to read electronic mail sent to your UCInet ID (see </FONT><a href=\"http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/\"><code>http://www.oit.uci.edu/email/</code></a><FONT >).

You\n  will want to read the assigned sections early so you can ask us about parts\n  that aren&#39;t clear. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >The assignments, like all technical specifications,\n  require careful and thorough reading and re-reading.  Expect to refer back\n  to the assignment often, and check it first when you have questions about\n  what&#39;s required or how to proceed.  Before you come to lab, be sure\n  to read the assignment to get an idea of what&#39;s required.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Start each assignment early.  Assignments will\n  be due weekly, but you&#39;ll need to spend some time on them nearly every\n  day.  Programming always takes longer to complete than you think it will,\n  even if you have previous programming experience.  By starting early, you&#39;ll\n  have time to ask in discussion section about problems you encounter.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >If you find yourself having trouble or getting\n  behind, speak with your TA or the instructor.  We have lots of ways to help.\n  But <I>never</I> take the shortcut of copying someone else&#39;s work and\n  turning it in; the consequences can be far worse than just a low score on\n  a lab assignment or exam. ICS takes academic honesty very seriously; for a more\n  complete discussion, see our course collaboration guidelines (<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/31/collab.html</code></a>) and the ICS departmental web page covering academic\nhonesty issues (</FONT><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty\"><code>http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/index.php#academic_honesty</code></A><FONT >).</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Turn in whatever portion of an assignment you\n  have completed on the due date.  It&#39;s much better to turn in something\n  rather than nothing; zeroes are hard to make up.  In some circumstances\n  you may arrange with your TA to work further on an assignment after the\n  due date, but you must turn in whatever you have when the official due date\n  comes.  Likewise, don&#39;t skip any quizzes or partner evaluations if you can help it; too many zeroes will significantly lower your overall score.</FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT >Always keep your own copy of each assignment,\n  both electronically and on paper; if an assignment should get lost in the\n  shuffle (or if a file server in the lab should crash, which has happened),\n  we&#39;ll expect you to be able to supply a replacement easily. </FONT></P>\n<P> <FONT ><B>Approximate course outline:</B> </FONT>\n</p><TABLE WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=1 CELLSPACING=0>\n  <COL WIDTH=8% />\n  <COL WIDTH=15% />\n  <COL WIDTH=77% />\n  <TR>\n    <TD WIDTH=8% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Week</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=15% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Date</U></FONT></TD>\n    <TD WIDTH=77% VALIGN=TOP><FONT ><U>Topics </U></FONT></TD>\n  </TR>\n  <!--\n  <TR>\n    <TD VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=DECIMAL CHAR='.'
