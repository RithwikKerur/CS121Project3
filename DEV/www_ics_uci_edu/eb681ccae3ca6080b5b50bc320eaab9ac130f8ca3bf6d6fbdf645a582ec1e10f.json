The \nalgorithm, based on a new linear-programming relaxation, \nfinds a packing \nof n rectangles whose total height is within a factor of (1+e) of \noptimal (up to an additive term), and has running time polynomial both \nin n and in 1/e.\n</p>\n<p>\nPaper: Claire Kenyon and Eric Remila, \"A Near-Optimal Solution to a \nTwo-Dimensional Cutting Stock Problem,\" Mathematics of Operations \nResearch, Volume 25 ,  Issue 4  (November 2000).\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
