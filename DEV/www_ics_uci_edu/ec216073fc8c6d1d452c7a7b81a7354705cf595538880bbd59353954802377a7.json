Aronov, L.J. Guibas, M. Teichmann, and L. Zhang,\nDiscrete & Computational Geometry Vol. 27, 2002, pp.461-483.\n(Preliminary version in Lecture Notes in CS, 1533, pp. 357-367, 1998.)\n<br>\nSpeaker: Javid Huseynov</h2>\n\n<p>\nAbstract:\nThe authors explore novel aspects of visibility for stationary and moving\npoints inside a simple polygon P. They provide a mechanism for expressing\nthe visibility polygon from a point as the disjoint union of\nlogarithmically many canonical pieces using a quadratic-space data\nstructure. This results in a query time proportional to the size of\nvisibility polygon but without cubic space overhead of earlier methods.\n<p>\nBy exploring the connection between visibility polygons and shortest-path\ntrees, the authors obtained a kinetic algorithm that can track the visibility\npolygon as the viewpoint moves along polygonal paths inside a simple\npolygon. The combination of the static and kinetic algorithms leads to a\nnew static algorithm in which the authors trade off space for increased\noverhead in the query time.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
