A fundamental component of \"GET for EDIT\" has to be a cookie that\n&gt;&gt;represents any stored context in the document server that needs to be\n&gt;&gt;reunited with the document on checkin.  Most, if not all, SCM systems\n&gt;&gt;are aware of their users' activity and use this awareness to keep users\n&gt;&gt;from stomping on each other's work.\n&gt;\n&gt;I think that use of cookies might be necessary in an implementation.\n&gt;However, I suspect that you can maybe do it all with only MD5\n&gt;authentication (i.e., only knowing the user).\nI'm not sure of the role for the cookie in this (just call me dense (later\non in this mail I guess why you might use one)). But the reservation and\ncontext establishment should be handled by LOCK. If a server requires\nspecial reservation for editing, it's the client's responsibility to obtain\na lock on the file before doing a PUT. If the client already has a cached\ncopy, a \"conditional GET\" based on the version at the server might be\nuseful.\n\nI think decoupling the access control aspects (LOCKing and so forth) from\nthe GET/PUT operations gives us a lot more generality, extremely easily. I\ndon't see any situation where \"get for edit\" is really different from \"LOCK\nresource for writing\" followed by GET. If the client has a local copy, the\nGET could even be conditional on the version they have being a leaf (though\nthis would not be a requirement). Then we might even be able to PUT a few\ntimes before releasing the lock!\n\nAttempts to PUT without a needed lock could bounce on servers that need or\nwant to enforce such a discipline on their clients.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;2.  \"GET for EDIT\" also, mind you, has to be able to GET something other\n&gt;&gt;than the head (\"tip\") revision of the document.  Not everybody wants to\n&gt;&gt;start their edits with the most current rev.  And I assume we both agree\n&gt;&gt;that \"GET for EDIT\" means get the source, not any derived version.\n&gt;\n&gt;Absolutely.  GET for EDIT would apply to an entity, and a versioned\n&gt;resource would contain many entities, one for each version.\n\nIn the requirements, since \"GET for edit\" is the same as GET, this is a given.\n\n&gt;&gt;3.  MkDir is nonsensical, since directories are artifacts of filesystems,\n&gt;&gt;and the URL namespace is not a filesystem!  I say if you PUT the blinkin\n&gt;&gt;document somewhere, the directory gets created if that's what the server\n&gt;&gt;needs.\n&gt;\n&gt;Well, I've been very careful to couch my discussion in terms of hierarchy\n&gt;levels, since I know that a filesystem mapping is only one possible name\n&gt;space mapping for the URL namespace for a server.\n&gt;\n&gt;That acknowledged, I think a PUT that automatically creates hierarchy\n&gt;levels is not a great idea, since a user who mistypes the name of a level\n&gt;could inadvertently create a new hierarchy level, when they really would\n&gt;have preferred an error message, and been forced to re-enter the name.\n\nNow we get into Yaron's requirements (about which I can only comment in\ngeneral terms. However I'll note that a lot of the file-management\noperations (DELETE, COPY, MKDIR) seem to me to be out of scope of\nVersioning (and maybe even collaborative editing). I also don't think that\nHTTP resources map 1-1 into filesystem objects, and would like to keep the\nseparation in our standards.\n\nI don't necessarily want to suggest that we rule out these operations, but\nthey seem to be more general HTTP issues than versioning or authoring\nissues to me.\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;4.  For new documents, I think rather than a blind, out of the blue PUT\n&gt;&gt;there should be something analogous to \"GET for EDIT\" -- e.g. a \"fake GET\n&gt;&gt;for ADD\".  The primary reason for this is to support item #1 above --\n&gt;&gt;to let the document server/SCM system know what the user is up to.\n&gt;\n&gt;Couldn't cookies handle this?\nCan you guys explain the cookies to me? Do we use a hash (like MD5) to\ndetermine if another GET is required, or what? At any rate,as I've said\nalready a few times, I think that separation of concerns makes \"GET for\nedit\" into a composite operation.\n\n&gt;&gt;5.  Versioning of directories is also non-sensical, for the same reason\n&gt;&gt;as #3 above.  Supporting renaming is one thing, but buying into a solution\n&gt;&gt;that involves versioned directories is brainocide.\n&gt;\n&gt;Hmmm.  Well some form of configuration support is definitely necessary.  A\n&gt;versioned hierarchy level seemed like a good idea to me, and is backed up\n&gt;by real-world use.\n\nWell, Brainocide sounds fun to the researcher in me... But I agree with Jim\n(if that's what he really means) that versioned directories belong with\nconfiguration management in the second phase of versioning work: there are\na lot of dissimilar/funky models of this stuff floating around, and we will\nneed to find a clean compromise. I think this needs to go to the back\nburner for the immediate crunch of work.\n\n&gt;&gt;6.  I think locking can be punted.  Add it in the next rev.\n&gt;\n&gt;Why?  I think there's a better case for locking than for versioning\n&gt;capability.  Also, the next rev. is HTTP/NG. I don't think there will be a\n&gt;1.3.\n\nLocking is better IMHO than special variants of GET. Let's make the\nconcerns of access and update completely separate.\n\nI'm trying not to be a partisan for my own point of view, but rather to\nfind common ground that covers all the versioning scenarios around. But I\nwill note that my goal is to make locking unnecessary for some kinds of\ncollaborative update. Now, my research may fail, but separating locking\nfunctionality from GET functionality doesn't hurt the rest of the world,\nand lets my kind of apporach fit in with the world.\n\n   Anyway, even systems like CVS try to keep locking to a bare minimum, so\nit's not just me...\n\nHTTP has flourished on the basis of incredible simplicity and orthogonality\n-- so even though versioning is complex, let's try to preserve these\nvirtues to the greatest extent that we can...\n\n   -- David\n\n--------------------------------------------+--------------------------\nDavid Durand                  <a href=\"mailto:dgd@cs.bu.edu\">dgd@cs.bu.edu</a> | david@dynamicDiagrams.com\nBoston University Computer Science          | Dynamic Diagrams\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/\">http://www.cs.bu.edu/students/grads/dgd/</a>    | http://dynamicDiagrams.com/\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0114.html\">Christopher Seiwald: \"Re: Seiwald Q &amp; A -- \"GET for EDIT\" cookies\"</a>\n<li> <b>Previous message:</b> <a href=\"0112.html\">Jim Whitehead: \"Technical Working Meeting 9/16\"</a>\n<!-- nextthread=\"start\" -->\n<!-- reply=\"end\" -->\n</ul>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
