contact me as soon as possible).\r\n<p>\r\n<b>IN ALL CASES, you must submit (on time) whatever part of the program you\r\n  have written</b>, if you are to receive any partial credit for a submission\r\n  (either on time or late with permission); if you submit <b>no</b> files, I\r\n   must assume that you have done <b>no</b> work on the assignment (which will\r\n  result in a grade of 0 for it).\r\nIf you are still programming the day that an assignment is due, you have planned\r\n  poorly; if you are still programming an hour before it is due, you have\r\n  planned very poorly.\r\n\r\n<h3>Extra Points for Submitting Early</h3>\r\nIf you submit your program early, you will receive extra points (1 point if\r\n  you submit it 24 hours early, 2 points if you submit it 48 hours early).\r\nSince each program is worth 50 points, you can raise your grade on a program\r\n  by 4% (almost half a letter grade) by turning it in two days early.\r\nNote that turning in a program more than two days early still results in just\r\n  2 extra points: the maximum you can get for an early turn-in.\r\n<p>\r\nGiven <b>Extra Points for Submitting Early</b> and <b>No Late Submissions</b>,\r\n  you should immediately start working on your programs when they are assigned.\r\nYou should plan to finish them early, both to receive extra credit and to\r\n  avoid missing a deadline.\r\nExpect that you will run into a few big \"bugs\" during each assignment, which\r\nwill take a day to figure out and fix; plan to finish early to garner the extra\r\ncredit (in the best scenario) or still finish on time (in the worst scenario).\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pair Programming</h3>\r\nWe will use <b>pair programming</b> on most assignments (<b>recommended</b>,\r\n  although it is sometimes <b>prohibited</b>); it is only\r\n  on these assignments that students can closely collaborate with their\r\n  partners, <b>turning in one copy of a jointly written program</b>.\r\nSee <a href=\"../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html\">Pair Programming</a> for\r\n  details about pair programming, and the right and wrong ways to do it.\r\nThere is a tremendous amount to be gained by both partners, if they pair\r\n  program the right way: both students working together, <b>not</b> splitting-up\r\n  the assignment.\r\n<p>\r\nYou can keep the same partner for multiple assignments or switch.\r\nTry to find a partner in your lab who has approximately your skill level and\r\n  study habits (e.g., working evening vs. weekends, work ethic to submit\r\n  programs early); try to find someone who lives near you (or with whom you\r\n  can easily meet outside lab) because I expect partners will need time outside\r\n  labs to finish the programs.\r\nYou may partner with someone in a different lab, but you both must be able to\r\n  attend (and actually attend) one of your labs for 4 hours/week.\r\nI recommend finding a partner when you are attending your lab, but there is\r\n  also a Piazza folder for this task.\r\n<p>\r\n<!---\r\nIf you believe that your schedule or life-circumstances disallow the ability to\r\n  work in a pair, contact me immediately by email.\r\nWithout making prior arrangments with me, individual students submitting a\r\n  program when pairing is required will receive a substantial point deduction.\r\n<p>\r\n--->\r\n\r\n<h3>Starting/Finishing Programs</h3>\r\nPlease read each assignment completely and carefully before starting it.\r\nI suggest that you print and then read it, marking relevant material with a\r\n  highlighter (details that you might forget by the end of an assignment).\r\nThen, re-read the assignment before submitting your work.\r\nPrograms are typically assigned on Tuesday and due two weeks later on the\r\n  following Tuesday, when the next program is assigned; students should plan to\r\n  have finished their current programs on Monday, so they can start on the new\r\n  programs in lab on Tuesday; see above for how this leads to extra credit.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Identifying Submissions</h3>\r\nOnly <b>ONE STUDENT</b> of the pair should submit the assignment (all parts of\r\n  it).\r\nIf students work in pairs, <b>BOTH NAMES</b> and their UCInetID names must\r\n  appear in a comment at the top of each submitted program.\r\nFor example if Romeo Montague (whose UCInetID is romeo1) submitted a program\r\n  that he worked on with his partner Juliet Capulet (whose UCInetID is jcapulet)\r\n  the comment at the top of each .py file would appear as:\r\n<pre><b>  # Submitter: romeo1(Montague, Romeo)\r\n  # Partner  : jcapulet(Capulet, Juliet)\r\n  # We certify that we worked cooperatively on this programming\r\n  #   assignment, according to the rules for pair programming</b></pre>\r\nIf you do not know what the terms <b>cooperatively</b> and/or\r\n  <b>rules for pair programming</b> mean, please read about\r\n  <a href=\"../common/handouts/pairprogramming.html\">Pair Programming</a>\r\n  before starting this assignment.\r\n<p>\r\nIf the names do not appear at the top of all your submissions in exactly this\r\n  form, points will be deducted.\r\nIf you are submitting by yourself, you may omit all lines but the first\r\n  (<b>Submitter</b>).\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Multiple Submissions/Failure to Submit</h3>\r\nCheckmate allows students to remove a submission and then resubmit.\r\nWe will grade only your final submission submitted before the <b>Due Time</b>\r\n (and extra credit points are based on only that submission's time).\r\nFor assignments with multiple parts, please <b>turn in each part\r\n  as you finish it</b>, so that I can accurately assess the progress of the\r\n  class as a whole during this assignment.\r\nIf you discover something wrong with your code after you submit it, you can\r\n  always correct the code, remove the old code, and resubmit the new code.\r\n<p>\r\nStudents are responsible for submitting their solutions on time.\r\nIn the past, individual students and pairs have submitted the wrong files;\r\n  in other cases, one student has submitted the wrong file for the pair.\r\nIn all these cases, what is submitted will be graded.\r\nI suggest that you carefully <b>double-check</b> what you submit to avoid these\r\n   mistake.\r\nAfter submitting (the correct file) to Checkmate, ensure that it shows the\r\n  assignment's status as completely submitted. \r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>No Retrieval</h3>\r\nStudents cannot retrieve a submission from Checkmate: it is a shortcoming of\r\n  the program (but designed to protect other students from possibly downloading\r\n  your work); so, you are responsible for archiving your work so that you have a\r\n  copy of what you submit.\r\nAlso, ensure that you always submit in the correct (most up to date) version of\r\n  your code; double-check; if you are unsure, resubmit.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Instructor Solutions</h3>\r\nI will release my solutions to all assignments the morning after they are due,\r\n  the EEE dropoff box for the class.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Programming Assignments Schedule: Due at 11:30pm</h3>\r\n<p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\" rules=\"all\">\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr><th>Program</th><th>Assigned/<br>Released</th><th>Due</th><th>Description</th><th>Pairing?</th>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #0 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#0</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">9/26</td><td align=\"center\">10/3</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program0/program.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  Python, Eclipse (the Debugger Perspective), and Testing\r\n</a>\r\n<td><b>Prohibited</b></td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #1 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#1</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">10/3</td><td align=\"center\">10/15</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program1/program.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  Iteration and Major Data Types\r\n  <!---<br> List, Tuple, Set, and Dict (and Open for files)-->\r\n</a>\r\n<p>\r\nIMPORTANT: In an effort to motivate students to work on these programs\r\nwell before the due date (and learn the material better, possibly earning\r\nextra credit points for submitting them early), I will grade only two parts\r\nsubmitted on 10/14 or later (and only one part submitted 10/15).\r\n<p>\r\nYou can submit as many parts as you want earlier. In fact, if you\r\nsubmit all parts by 10/13 you will earn 2 extra credit points; but if\r\nyou submit all parts on 10/15, we will grade only one, discarding the\r\nother four.\r\n<p>\r\nSo, start early on this assignment and work at a steady pace, trying to\r\nsubmit your work well before the due date. Submit only two programs\r\non 10/14 or later; submit only one on 10/15 (so either submit two on 10/14, or\r\nsubmit one on 10/14 and one on 10/15; but if you submit two on 10/14 and\r\none on 10/15, one won't be graded).\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #2 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#2</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">10/15</td><td align=\"center\">10/29</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program2/program.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n Classes, Overloaded Operators, and Iterators\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #3 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#3</td>\r\n  <td align=\"center\">10/29</td><td align=\"center\">11/12</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program3/program.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  Namedtuple (Text Processing: Programs writing Programs)\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #4 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#4</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">11/12</td><td align=\"center\">11/26</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program4/program.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  Annotation Checker (Mutual Recursion)\r\n</a>\r\n<td>Recommended</td>\r\n\r\n\r\n<!------- Program #5 ------->\r\n\r\n<tr><td align=\"right\">#5</td>\r\n<td align=\"center\">11/26</td><td align=\"center\">12/8</td>\r\n<td><a href=\"assignments/program5/program.html\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n  Inheritance and Animation\r\n</a>\r\n<td><b>Prohibited</b></td>\r\n\r\n\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"center\" width=\"100%\">\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
