This text is a massaged form of\na section from my versioning proposal (now available in HTML format from\nthe working group page, &lt;<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/</a>&gt;).\n\nThese capabilities can be divided into two groupings:\n  - capabilities which support browsing\n  - capabilities which support authoring\n\nBrowsing support capabilities:\n\n1. Retrieval of a stated version of an entity: Any given revision of an\nentity should be accessible, thus supporting links to stated revisions of\nentities.  (This capability is provided by the \";version={opaque version\nid}\" capability we have been discussing.)\n\n2. Browsing within a collection of entities: Often multiple entities\ntogether form a logical grouping, for example, a collection of HTML and GIF\nentities which comprise online documentation for a software product.  It is\ndesirable to provide support for browsing within such a collection without\nrequiring either the user or the entities to explicitly name the\ndestination entity version of each link traversal.\n\n3. Retrieval of derivation relationships between versions of an entity: The\nability to trace the development and ownership of an entity provides\nvisibility into the development of that entity, and into the namespace of\nversion identifiers for versions of that entity.\n\nAuthoring support capabilities:\n\n4. Writing to a given version of an entity: Once changes have been made to\nan entity, versioning policies often dictate that the changes be written\ninto a new, stated version of that entity.\n\n5. Policy-neutral versioning: the methods defined for accessing, modifing,\nand locking entities should allow multiple versioning policies to be built\non top of them.  For example, lock-based policies, as employed by RCS, and\nmerge-based policies, as implemented in CVS, should both be implementable.\nSince a wide range of applications will use versioning, the greater the\nflexibility in the types of versioning policies which may be supported, the\ngreater the types of applications that can employ this protocol.\n\n6. Parallel development support: Since it frequently occurs that multiple\npeople edit the same entity simultaneously, this type of activity must be\nsupported.  User agents must be supplied with enough information to inform\ntheir users when they are entering a parallel development situation, and\nthey must be supplied with the versions of parallel entities so they can\nprovide merge support for the entity contents.  Futhermore, since it is\ncurrently beyond the state of the art to provide merge support for certain\nentity types (e.g., MPEG video), it must be possible to disallow parallel\ndevelopment on these entity types.\n\n7. Visibility control: Through the user agent, it should be possible to\ncontrol the external visibility of an entity.  For example, this is useful\nfor ensuring that working revisions of an entity are not accessible by the\nentire world.\n\n8. Configuration support: The user must be able to create versioned\ncollections of versioned entities.  When creating online documentation, an\nauthor will create multiple pages, which may, for example, contain an HTML\ndocument and supporting bitmap graphics and applet objects.  The author\nwill want to make a versionable collection of the entities which comprise\neach page, as well as a versionable collection of all the pages.\n\nNote that you might not want all users to be able to employ all\ncapabilities all the time.  For the development of these requirements, I\nhave assumed a super-user who would be able to do everything, all the time.\nAccess control mechanisms can limit which users can employ which\ncapabilities.\n\n- Jim Whitehead &lt;<a href=\"mailto:ejw@ics.uci.edu\">ejw@ics.uci.edu</a>&gt;\n</pre>\n<!-- body=\"end\" -->\n<hr>\n<p>\n<ul>\n<!-- next=\"start\" -->\n<li> <b>Next message:</b> <a href=\"0048.html\">David G.
