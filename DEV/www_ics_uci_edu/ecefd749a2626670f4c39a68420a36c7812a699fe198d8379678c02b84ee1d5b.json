The rate at which new technology develops \nnow is \nhighest in history.  The modern computer and telecommunications infrastructure\nproduced and gained from this increased rate has also afforded us with \nthe revolutionary speed in which we hear and adopt the new technology.\nThis all has indeed been affecting society in tremendously different ways---jobs\nhave arisen, growth and relay of information efficiently increased,\nand increased national gross to name a few ways. \n<p>\nHowever the ability and potential to take advantage of our cutting edge\ntechnology rests not on how much of the new knowledge or technology we\ncan produce but on society's ability and capacity to accept, absorb, and \nuse it.  What this means is that the limits of science and technological \nadvancement as well as economic growth may be ascribed to society's ability\nto assimilate the new knowledge and transform it into a part of our lives.\n<p>\nThe concern and belief that many within the political, scientific, and economic\narena have regards then the approach that we must also develop new methods\nand approaches to broaden the capacity, increase the reasoning, and\noffset the limitations of our society.  What follows in this paper is\na discussion of a few areas in which significant efforts have been made as \nso the technology\nwe have may become more useful and accessible to society. \n<p>\nThis paper's principle intent is to provide attention to these areas and by no\nmeans an is argument for these areas.  However, it is hoped after seeing the\nnew perspective, that readers will be swayed over into adopting the belief\nfor these areas of research otherwise known as Human Computer Interaction or\nHCI.  \n<p>\n\n<hr>\n \n<H2><A NAME=\"Intro\">INTRODUCTION</A></H1>\nI begin this discussion first <A HREF=\"http://www.cs.bgsu.edu/HCI/defn.html\">\ndefining what HCI is</A> or what does it stand for.\nHuman Computer Interaction is <i>the study of the interaction between\nhuman beings and computers</i> (Booth, An Introduction to Human-Computer \nInteraction, Lawrence Erlbaum, 1989, p.4).  \n<p>\nIn that article where Booth\ndefines HCI, Booth also details the 5 more definitions of different areas\nwithin HCI:\n<dl>\n<dt> Research into International Hardware and Software\n<dd> Developing, studying and providing guidelines for various ways or\ninteracting with computers, both at the software and hardware level\n<dt> Research into Machine Models\n<dd> Study how users interact with computers\n<dt> Research at the Task Level\n<dd> Determining how well systems meet user's needs\n<dt> Research into Design and Development\n<dd> Studying designers and design process\n<dt> Research into Organizational Impact\n<dd> Studying the impact of new systems on organizations, groups,\nand individuals\n</dl>\nThe also available <A HREF=\"http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/contents.html\">HCI FAQ</A> references Human Computer Interaction as :\n<ul>\n<li> \"a body of knowledge about human limitations, human abilities, and other\nhuman characteristics that are relevant to design\"\n<li> \"the application of human factors information to the design of tools,\nmachines, systems, tasks, jobs, and environments for safe, comfortable, and\neffective human use\"\n<li> \"a discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation \nof interacting computing systems for human use and with the study of major \nphenomena surrounding them.\"---<A HREF=\"http://info.acm.org\">ACM</A> \nSIGCHI Curricula for Human-Computer Interaction, 1992, p. 5\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n<hr>\n\n<H2><A NAME=\"Motivation\">MOTIVATION</A></H1>\nI am interested in the ease of use when it comes to utilizing a computer and\nits software tools and hardware devices available.  Often when using\na computer and migrating to another computer to use I must adhere to the \nnew environmental constructs, constraints, and conventions  that the \nnew machine exists on.\nIf it is a similar platform, then there may be little adjustments made in\nthe mode of use; otherwise, the shift in manner of use is wide.  This is\noften seen when swapping between a machine with a graphical user interface \n(GUI), such as the <A HREF=\"gopher://sumex-aim.stanford.edu/11/info-mac\">\nMacIntosh based machines</A> and ones with a command \nline interfaces, like DOS or Unix based machines as the \n<A HREF=\"http\"//www.intel.com>x86</A> or \n<A HREF=\"http://www.fh-wolfenbuettel.de/cgi-bin/man2html\">Sparc</A> machines.\nIn these cases, the <A HREF=\"http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy/Engineering-and-Technology/Computer-Technology/Operating-Systems.html\">operating system</A> is \nprimarily responsible for the distinctions.  Personally, I find it a challenge\nto learn the new commands of a new platform.  For many others I have seen, it \nbecomes a frustrating <i>bang on that dang keyboard and mouse</i> type of\nexperience.  Yet, at crucial times when I am constrained by time to accomplish\na task, then working on a new or unaccustomed platform degrades terribly the\nproductivity.  Though there is wide <A HREF=\"http://www.maths.tcd.ie/scrg/os-faq.html\">research over operating systems</A>, the primary concern for me as a\nuser is its ease of use and learning.\n\n<p>\n<hr>\n\n<H2><A NAME=\"Analysis\">ANALYSIS</A></H1>\nThis section was originally intended to discuss a few of the different areas\n(ergonmics, reliability, safety, security, etc)\nthat HCI is involved in.  This however would be a monumental task to cover\neven just a small number of the areas due to the complexity each issue or area.\nSo I have streamline this document to pertain roughly to user interface issues.\nRather than also present analysis in a textual prose type of approach, I have\nalso adopted the format of <i>Question/Answer</i> for easier delineation of\nthe issues within the area of user interfaces.  By no means though, does this\nimply that all possible issues covered and discussed.  The objective is to\nonly present a layman's view of some of the more apparent  or sometimes subtle\ntenets\ninvolved in user interfaces. \n<p>\n\n<H2><A NAME=\"UI\">User Interfaces</A></H1>\n<i>Does the <A HREF=\"http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-9.html\">\ncolors on the screen play a role is ease of use?</A></i><br>\nYes.  People's eyes are sensitive to different colors and different light\nintensities.  Research (Taptafaporn and Saito 1990) has shown that \ndisplay polarity and lighting \nconditions may be the causes of some users' eyestrain.  It is recommended\nthat the degree of both factors be dependent on the working environment and\nthe individual.  What is not recommended is reading from a monitor with\na dark background, which causes pupil dilation (as in a dark room \nenvironment) and thus causes the image on the retina to defocus.  The \nresearch concluded that having a positive polarity display, black letters\non a white background, is physiologically and psychologically superior\nto the reverse.\n<p>\n<i>Why don't developers just produce a comprehensively intense manual that \nprovides all the answers? </i><br>\nSuch a tome would be rather lengthy and often unmanageable for all individuals\nto carry about.  In addition, each individual sees and experiences things\nin such a diverse manner, that it is nearly impossible to cover all the\nquestions everyone has.  Another trend is that it may be impractical since\nmost users tend to not read the manual and refer to it as the last option.\nAs the <b><A HREF=\"http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-11.html\">\nGolden Rules</A></b> of the order of what to do when a user experiences\ndifficulty with a system, many users follow this ordered list:\n<ol>\n<li> Experiment for themselves.\n<li> Ask the nearest person.\n<li> Ask the office expert.\n<li> Phone expert.\n<li> Try online help.\n<li> Look in the manual.\n</ol> \n\n<p>\n<i><A HREF=\"http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-10.html\">\nWhat's the big deal over having a modal dialogue box as opposed to a\nmodeless one?</A></i><br>\nModal ones are used when a user is required to first make the appropriate\nresponse to the dialogue box in order to continue.  In many cases, this \nis not essential or not\nintuitive for a user to respond directly with the dialogue box.  Making a\nmodeless ones is preferred to allow a user to react in his or her own\nidiosyncratic way rather than get flustered figuring out what exactly needs\nto be done.\n\n<p>\n<i> <A HREF=\"http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-16.html\">\nIs there a single easy in-lab way to determine if the operating system\nworks synchronously in tuned with a user?</A></i><br>\nNo.  In order to test if it behaves the way a user expects it to behave\nis to allow numerous users to use it extensively.  This is also known as \nbeta testing.\n\n \n<p>\n<i><A HREF=\"http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/ematias/faq/S/S-18.html\">\nWhat type of issues are involved when making an icon?  It doesn't seem\nlike a big deal.</A></i><br>\nWhen crafting icons, association relationships must be highly regarded.\nMany assume that the shape of an icon conveys enough meaning; this \nhowever is not true.  Icons should be tested after creation to check\nfor weak relationships.  Tests have also shown that icons with names\nlabeled on them make learning easier.\n\n<p>\n<hr>\n\n<H2><A NAME=\"Conclusions\">CONCLUSIONS</A></H1>\nThere are multiple issues involved in the interactions between humans and\nmachines.  Whether they be obvious or complex and subtle, when improperly dealt\nwith, the issues restrain effective and efficient communication between a user\nand a machine.  The small subset of issues examined in this document for\njust <b>one</b> area, user interfaces, may have seemed anal retentitive or\ntrivial; but in reality, they are major issues being dealt with and researched\ncontinuously.  Can there be one universal answer to all the issues involved?\nMost likely no.  As our society continues to diversify itself in new and\nmore innovative directions, our issues become more complex and unsolvable.\nHowever, through various approaches we can alleviate the complexity through\nHCI research.  HCI research concentrates on three key elements:\n<ol>\n<li> New interaction paradigms that enable users to communicate with computers\nand with others using computers in more effective, human ways;\n<li> Fundamental understanding of the nature of interaction that will enable users\nto achieve their goals more directly, including a better understanding of the\nlimitations of human information processing;\n<li> <A HREF=\"http://www.sei.cmu.edu/topics.html\">Engineering methods</A>\n for interactive system design and development that\nwill improve the quality and reduce the costs of user interfaces for\nnew systems.\n</ol>\nWhat we need now is a call for the all the innovators and leaders in\ndevelopment to adhere them closely.\n<p>\n<hr>\n\nSubmitted March 18, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
