I am researching ALL Langsam's in the belief it is one large family. \nThe core seems to be primarily in Galicia and Slovakia. There were many Samuel (anglocized \nversion of Shmiel) Langsam's in our family. Can you elaborate at all? Wife's surname (David's)?  \nWhere they lived? Shmiel's parents? Age? What is your source for Shmiel Langsam? Do you know of \nother Langsam's from his family?\n\nPlease stay in touch.\n\nGood Luck!\n-Moishe\n_________________________________________________________________________\nFrom: \"Howard Nightingale\" &lt;baker1@yesic.com> \nTo: <moishe@langsam.com> \nSubject: Re: Langsam family tree. \nDate: Tue, 6 Feb 2001 10:01:49 -0500 \nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook Express 5.00.2314.1300 \n\n\nThank you for your answer.    The information I have on the family is as\nfollows:\n\n\nEphroim and Rifka Sauerhaft had four children:  \nFayge Leah (who married Aaron Adler) \nPesel who married (David?) \nGolda ( who married Lazar Wiesenfeld) and \nYaakov Baruch (who married Sheinder Rikel)   \n\nPesel and David\nhad  five children: Moishe, Itzik, Rifka, Reisel and Rachel (who married\nShmiel Langsam)  \n\nEphroim and Rifka lived in Bialoboki, Poland.  Pesel was born in Bialoboki, \nPoland and then married David (?) and moved to Drobitzka (it may be Debica).\nDavid (?) was a farmer.\n\n\nI hope that this helps.\n\n\nLooking forward to your reply - maybe we are related.\n\n\nHoward\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nDate: Wed, 14 Nov 2001 22:39:32 -0500\nTo: \"Howard Nightingale\" &lt;baker1@yesic.com>\nFrom: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\nSubject: Re: Langsam family tree.\n\nHi,\nDo you have dates (or years) of birth for Rachel and Shmiel?

They had several children one of whom was a daughter Rachel. She married Shmiel Langsam during WWII and both perished.\n\nDoes this ring any bell?\n\nMy family comes from Manasterz, Jawornik Polski, Zagorze, Kanczuga, Gac, Jaroslaw and other shtetls in the area.\n\nHoward Nightingale\nToronto, Ontario\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nFrom: moishe.miller@totalben.com [mailto:moishe.miller@totalben.com] \nSent: Saturday, November 09, 2013 9:42 PM\nTo: Howard Nightingale\nSubject: RE: Langsam\n\nHoward,\n\nThank you again for your inquiry. We were in touch several years ago. See:\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/langsam/shmiel.htm \n\nDo you know the year of birth for Rachel? And how do you know she married Shmuel? Where did they marry?\n\nBTW, all of your places of research overlap with mine. \n\nMoishe Miller\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\nDate: Sun, Nov 10, 2013 8:12 am\nFrom: Howard Nightingale <djj-19@sympatico.ca>\nSubject: Re: Langsam \n\nMoishe, now that you mention the prior email I do remember.  I have no date of birth for Rachel.  The information on the family came from my cousins,(Shmuel Lazar Goldman was born in 1906 in Gac and Reizel Sauerhaft born in Zagorze on March 1 1907 [based on naturalization records when she came to Canada) whom  I interviewed between the early 1970s to the late 1970s.  They are now deceased.   \n\nHoward Nightingale\n\n\n_________________________________________________________________________\n  \n</pre>\n\n<P><A HREF=\"../hometree.htm\">\n<IMG SRC=\"../img/smaltree.gif\" WIDTH=36 HEIGHT=35 BORDER=0 ALIGN=\"RIGHT\" alt=\"Go Home\"></A><BR><P>\n<HR>\n<P>\nI would be very interested to hear from anyone with knowledge or an interest in the Miller family.<P>\n<ADDRESS>Moishe Miller<BR>moishe@langsam.com</ADDRESS>\n<BR>\nMy home address is<PRE>\n           1374 East 28th Street\n           Brooklyn NY 11210-5311\n           USA\n</PRE>\n  \n<P ALIGN=RIGHT><FONT SIZE=-2>Last updated 12/1/2013</FONT>\n<P>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>", "encoding": "ascii"}
