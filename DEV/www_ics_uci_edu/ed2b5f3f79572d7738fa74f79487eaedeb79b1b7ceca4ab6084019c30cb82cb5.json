The challenge is how these\r\n                    optimizations can be coordinated across layers. What is the right architectural\r\n                    framework that allows such optimizations/adaptations to occur simultaneously and even\r\n                    dynamically? To answer these questions, we have proposed a proxy-based middleware solution\r\n                    to accommodate optimizations across diverse clients with limited computation and battery power.\r\n                    We try to improve the energy optimizations possible at each system level by exploiting\r\n                    information available at other levels. The goal of our work is to exploit a distributed\r\n                    power-aware middleware framework to coordinate low-level architectural\r\n                    optimizations (CPU, memory, and register), OS power-saving mechanisms (Dynamic Voltage\r\n                    Scaling) and adaptive middleware techniques (admission control, transcoding, network\r\n                    traffic regulation, mobility etc.) for improving performance and energy gains for portable\r\n                    devices. We also identify interaction parameters between the different computational levels\r\n                    that can facilitate effective optimizations. Recent approaches towards power management suggest\r\n                    such  open and flexible architecture for mobile devices that allows higher layers to make\r\n                    informed adaptations at lower layers and vice-versa.\r\n                </p>\r\n                    <center><img alt=\"cross-layer adaptation\" src=\"crosslayer1.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"172\" /></center>\r\n                 <p>\r\n                    In practice, deployment of such a unified power management framework for mobile devices would\r\n                    require a set of APIs (programming interfaces) to be implemented at the various computational\r\n                    layers; this API should facilitate effective communication between the various levels. Such\r\n                    a capability can be effectively exploited to drive various cross layer adaptations. We have\r\n                    implemented such a framework as a part of the <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~forge\">FORGE</a>\r\n                    project. The framework is designed to study and evaluate power vs. performance trade-offs for\r\n                    various cross-layer adaptations and identify various \"parameters\" that can be dynamically tuned\r\n                    to provide an optimized configuration for different applications.\r\n                 </p>\r\n\r\n                 <h2>Dynamo Middleware Framework</h2>\r\n                 <p>\r\n                    The Dynamo distributed middleware framework is used in the above cross-layer adaptation framework\r\n                    to coordinate low-level architectural optimizations, OS power saving mechanisms (Dynamic Voltage\r\n                    Scaling) and Application requirements for improved performance and higher energy gains on\r\n                    low-power mobile devices. Additionally, Dynamo employs adaptive middleware techniques (e.g.\r\n                    admission control,proxy-based transcoding, intelligent network traffic regulation etc.) to\r\n                    aid the power management at the portable device. The middleware effectively exploits local\r\n                    information (e.g. residual  battery)\r\n                    to perform adaptations at the proxy and utilizes global system state information (e.g. congestion\r\n                    levels, mobility patterns etc.) available at the proxy to drive local adaptations.\r\n\r\n                    Dynamo v.0.1 is implemented for the Linux operating system.<br/><br/>\r\n                    It has the following features:\r\n                    <ul>\r\n                        <li>Libraries for dynamically querying system state for mobile devices.</li>\r\n                        <li>Library for querying/setting back-light levels for low-power devices.</li>\r\n                        <li>Communication Library for communicating with network machines.</li>\r\n                        <li>Well defined interface definitions for cross-layer interactions with\r\n                            applications, the power-aware OS and the proxy servers.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <h2>Power-Aware Operating System</h2>\r\n                 <p>\r\n                    The power aware operating system implements the Dynamic Frequency Scaling libraries over\r\n                    the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel distribution is modified to keep track of application\r\n                    execution times, deadlines and periods. This is achieved by adding new system calls into the\r\n                    Linux kernel. The applications linked to the power aware kernel using the API are executed\r\n                    as POSIX threads. The power aware API library also defines interfaces for the Dynamo middleware\r\n                    to communicate with it.\r\n                 </p>\r\n                 <p>\r\n                      The block diagram below shows the various aspects of the cross layer framework.\r\n                 </p>\r\n                     <img alt=\"Dynamo Middleware Diagram\" src=\"figarch.png\" />\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"footer\">\r\n                <!-- &copy; Copyright 2004 Michael Philpott. -->\r\n            </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
