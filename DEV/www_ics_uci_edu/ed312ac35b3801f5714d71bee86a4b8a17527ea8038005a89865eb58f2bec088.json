On the other hand, working in the lab has some genuine\r\nbenefits, particularly for those of you who are fairly new to\r\nprogramming. In the lab, you'll find that help is more readily\r\navailable when you get stuck, that your machine setup will generally be\r\nstable and designed well for the task of working on your assignments,\r\nand that you're free of the distractions of your home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nevertheless, I'm aware that many of you, either out of want or\r\nneed, will choose to do some percentage of your work at home. What\r\nfollows is enough information to turn your Windows-based machine into a\r\nJava development environment at little or no cost.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Getting started</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you get started, be aware that this document only describes\r\nhow to set up Java on a Windows machine. If you're using a Macintosh or\r\nrunning Linux, I'm sorry to say that you're on your own -- though you\r\nmay find that many of the concepts here will translate fairly well to\r\nyour system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, you need a Java compiler and Java virtual\r\nmachine. There are several packages that include these tools, but a\r\ngreat option is to download the Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) SDK from\r\n<a href=\"http://java.sun.com/\">java.sun.com</a>.  <i>J2SE is absolutely free!</i>\r\nRemember, you will need a version that is at least as recent as\r\n1.5 (which is also called 5.0).  J2SE includes a Java compiler (<b>javac</b>), a Java virtual machine (<b>java</b>),\r\nand all of the standard Java library components -- in other words,\r\neverything you need to write Java programs in a wide variety of problem\r\ndomains, and more than enough firepower for the assignments we'll be\r\ngiving you. Make sure that you download the SDK, not the JRE. The JRE\r\nis the Java Runtime Environment, which includes the necessary code to\r\nallow you to <i>run</i> Java programs, but not to write and compile them!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, you'll need a <i>text editor</i>, which you'll use to\r\nwrite and edit your program code. There are many inexpensive and/or\r\nfree options available. In the lab, we provide TextPad, which you can\r\ndownload from <a href=\"http://www.textpad.com/\">www.textpad.com</a>.\r\nTextPad requires a modest registration fee, which you should pay if you\r\nplan to use it on a continuous basis. You may be able to find free text\r\neditors, particularly those written in Java, at shareware/freeware\r\ndownload sites such as <a href=\"http://www.download.com/\">www.download.com</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">Installation: the easy part</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presumably, your text editor will include an installation program to set it up and make it completely ready for your use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>J2SE also includes an installation program, which places all of the\r\nfiles into the appropriate places and sets up some desktop shortcuts\r\nfor you. However, after running the installation program, you still\r\nwon't be able to execute <b>javac</b> or <b>java</b>, without making a couple of modifications \"under the hood\" of your system.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">The (not all that) hard part: PATH and CLASSPATH</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can execute programs from a Command Prompt (or, as Windows 95/98\r\ncall it, an \"MS-DOS prompt\") by simply typing their names, such as <b>javac</b> or <b>java</b>.  But there's a catch: Windows has to know where it can <i>find</i> these programs.  This is the job of the <b>PATH</b>\r\nenvironment variable. PATH is a list of folders, separated by\r\nsemicolons, in which Windows will look for a program whenever you try\r\nto execute one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, whenever the Java compiler or Java virtual machine need\r\nto be able to use a Java class (such as when you import a class from\r\nthe Java library), the compiler or virtual machine needs to be able to\r\nknow where to find it. This is the job of the <b>CLASSPATH</b>\r\nenvironment variable. CLASSPATH is a list of folders, separated by\r\nsemicolons, in which the Java compiler or virtual machine will look for\r\na Java class whenever it's trying to find one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, to make J2SE work, you have to modify the PATH and CLASSPATH\r\nenvironment variables on your system, so that Windows will be able to\r\nfind <b>javac</b> and <b>java</b>, and so that <b>javac</b> and <b>java</b> will be able to find all of the necessary Java classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How you modify these variables depends on which version of Windows\r\nyou're using.  In either case, I'll assume that you've installed J2SE\r\ninto the default directory during installation, which, for the sake\r\nof this document, let us assume is\r\n<b>C:\\jdk1.5.0_01</b>.  If you installed it somewhere else, you'll\r\nneed to use your installation directory instead of the one above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>On Windows 95, 98, and probably ME.</b> (I say \"probably\" because\r\nI don't have a version of ME handy to test this with.) On these\r\nversions of Windows, you can set the PATH and CLASSPATH by modifying\r\nthe file <b>C:\\AUTOEXEC.BAT</b>.  Add the following two lines to the <i>end</i> of this file:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\\jdk1.5.0_01\\bin\r\nset CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;.;C:\\jdk1.5.0_01\\lib\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You'll probably need to restart your system for these changes to take effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>On Windows 2000 and XP.</b>  Right-click the <b>My Computer</b> icon on your desktop and select <b>Properties</b>.  Select the <b>Advanced</b> tab.  Click the <b>Environment Variables...</b> button.  Under \"System variables,\" find the <b>PATH</b> variable and add this to the <i>end</i> of it:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>;C:\\jdk1.5.0_01\\bin\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>Then find the CLASSPATH variable. If it doesn't exist (and it\r\nprobably won't, if you've never used your system to develop Java code),\r\nclick the <b>New...</b> button, specifying <b>CLASSPATH</b> as its name, and the following value:</p>\r\n\r\n<pre>.;C:\\jdk1.5.0_01\\lib\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n<p>You may need to restart your system, or at least start up a new\r\nCommand Prompt window, in order for these changes to take effect.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"title\">That's it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, you should be good to go.
