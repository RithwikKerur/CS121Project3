Authors\n          define the angle hull, AH(D), of D to be the set of all points \n          in P that can see two points of D at a right angle. They further\n          prove that the perimeter AH(D) is at most twice the perimeter\n          of the relative convex hull of D. In special case, when P is \n          the full plane, this bound is given as {/pi}/2. Both bounds are\n          tight.\n<p>\nThe practical application of this topic is found in designing on-line\ncompetitive navigation strategies for autonomous robots in unknown\nenvironments.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
