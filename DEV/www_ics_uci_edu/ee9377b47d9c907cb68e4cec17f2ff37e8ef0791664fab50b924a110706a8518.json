Please use those as I have added some extra notes that should clarify some of the exercises and remove some ambiguities.\n<br>\n\n<H3>Announcement 4: 1/14/02</H3>\n\n<LI>I will hold a make up class for the lecture we are missing on January 21st.\nThe lecture will be held on Tuesday, January 22nd, from 5 - 7pm in CS 432 (our current classroom). \n<br>\n<LI>Lab 2 is due on Tuesday January 22nd, please either hand in during the make up class or hand it in to the ICS front office during the day of January 22nd.\n<br>\n<LI>Lab 3 is two weeks long, the report will be due on February 4th, in class.

I can only add students to replace the drops. So far there have been very few drops (2 to be exact).\n<br>\n\n<H3>Announcement 1: 1/7/02</H3>\n\nWelcome to ICS 156 Announcement page.
