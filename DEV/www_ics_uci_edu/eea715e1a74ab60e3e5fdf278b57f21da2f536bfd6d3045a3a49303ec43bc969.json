Apollonius of Perga first showed how to do this with compass \nand straightedge.\n\n<P>If the initial three circles are mutually tangent, there are only two \nApollonian circles.  The poem \"The Kiss Precise\" by Frederick Soddy \ndescribes the formula for the tangent's radii, but there is also a \nsimple compass and straightedge construction:\n\n<P>Form a triangle connecting the three circle centers (black), \nand drop a perpendicular line from each center to the opposite triangle \nedge (blue).  This line cuts its circle at two points; draw a line from \neach cut point to the point of tangency of the other two circles (green).  \nThese green lines cut their circles in two more points, which are the \npoints of tangency of the Apollonian circles.  Once these three points on \neach Apollonian circle are known, the circles themselves are easily \nconstructed.\n\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER>\n<applet code     = \"de.cinderella.CindyApplet\"\n        archive = \"cindyrun.jar\"\n        width    = 630\n        height   = 350>\n<param  name=kernelID  value=\"931039146781\">\n<param  name=viewport value=\"de.cinderella.ports.EuclideanPort\">\n<param  name=filename value=\"apollonian.cdy\">\n<param  name=polar value= \"false\">\n<param  name=width value= \"630\">\n<param  name=height value=\"350\">\n<param  name=doublebuffer value= \"true\">\n<param  name=mesh value=\"false\">\n<param  name=axes value=\"false\">\n<param  name=snap value=\"false\">\n<param  name=scale value=\"25.0\">\n<param  name=originx value=\"210\">\n<param  name=originy value= \"233\">\n<param  name=deltafactor value= \"0\">\n<param  name=pref0 value=\"cinderella.defaults.background=255,255,255\">\n<IMG SRC=\"apollonian.gif\" WIDTH=632 HEIGHT=349\nALT=\"Apollonian circles\"><BR>\n<SMALL>If you were running Java, you'd see a nice animation instead of this \ngif.</SMALL>\n</applet>\n</DIV>\n\n<P>The correctness of this construction can be proven by\n<A HREF=\"inversion.html\">inversion</A> (possibly surprising, since \ninversion doesn't preserve centers of circles, and this construction \ndefinitely uses the centers): let the three initial circles be A, B, and C, \nand let D be a circle centered at the point where A and B are tangent, such \nthat C and D cross at right angles. Then inverting through D produces a \nfigure in which A and B have been transmuted to parallel lines a and \nb(specifically, the lines through the pairs of points where these circles \nare crossed by D). The blue perpendicular we constructed is a third \nparallel line halfway between a and b; all pairs of circles that touch each \nother and a and b have their point of mutual tangency on this\n<A HREF=\"bisector.html\">bisector</A>.  In particular, the circles that are \ntangent to a, b, and C touch C at the two crossing points with this line. \nTo find the points of tangency for A, B, and C, we need only apply the \ninversion again to these crossing points. Since C is perpendicular to D, it \nis preserved by the inversion, but its inside and outside arcs are swapped. \nThe green radial lines are also preserved by the inversion, and help us \nfind the point on the inside arc corresponding to the crossing point on the \noutside arc and vice versa.\n\n<P>The newly constructed circles are part of several more triples of tangent \ncircles, so one can iterate this process, producing more and more tangent \ncircles.  The result of this iteration is called the <B>Apollonian \ngasket</B>.\n\n<P>Note also that the lines of the construction form three triples that meet \nin common points. The point where the blue lines meet is just the \northocenter of the triangle, but\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/pubs/p-tstc.html\">what are the two green points?</A>\n\n<P><HR><P>\nAnimation created by <A HREF=\"http://www.cinderella.de/\">Cinderella</A>.<BR>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"apollonian.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
