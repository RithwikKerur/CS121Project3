Ferro\" &lt;<a href= \n\"mailto:jf41+@andrew.cmu.edu\">jf41+@andrew.cmu.edu</a>&gt;\n<b>Subject:</b>        TWIXT rules, and some strategy\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\nHopefully this post will be the final word on the basic rules and\nterminology questions about this game, so that we can get on to the\nmeatier strategy considerations. \n\n<p>Here are the rules as Avalon Hill printed them in the Leisure\nTime Games version:</p>\n\n<pre>\n----------\n\nHOW TO PLAY TWIXT (for two players)\n\n1. Red plays first.  Players move alternately by placing _one_ peg at a\n   time on the board.  Pegs may be placed by a player in any empty peg\n   hole except those inhis opponent's border row.\n\n2. When, after he has placed a peg, a player finds that he can _link_\n   two or more of his pegs, he may place one or more links between these\n   pegs to make a barrier.  Pegs may be linked only when the distance\n   between them corresponds to the diagonal of a 6-holed rectangle.\n\n   [ Diagrams \"Twix--the basic linking move\", \"Eight possible linking\n     directions from a given peg\", \"Double-Link (numbers indicate order\n     of placement)\" not included.  The Double-Link diagram shows how the\n     third peg can be bridged to both the first and second pegs. ]\n\n   A barrier cannot be crossed.  No barrier exists where a player could\n   have linked but did not--whether the omission was intentional or\n   unintentional.\n\n   Before placing a peg, a player may, if he desires, carefully remove\n   any pegs and links he has previously placed on the board.  However,\n   he should be certain not to remove any pegs and/or links which would\n   give the opponent the advantage.\n\n3. To win, a player must connect his borders with an uninterrupted chain\n   of linked pegs.  If neither player can complete such a barrier, the\n   game is a draw.\n\nHOW TO PLAY DOUBLE TWIXT (for four players)\n\nDouble TwixT is TwixT for four players in teams of two.  Rules are the\nsame as for TwixT, with the following qualifications:\n\n1. Partners sit opposite one another.  Play alternates counterclockwise\n   around the board.\n\n2. No partner is limited to any one sector of the TwixT board: partners\n   may play the two ends of a common barrier, or they may build\n   independent sectors on any part of the board.  Partners may not\n   communicate strategies to one another by any form of signalling.\n\n3. Once, and only once in each game, on partner of either team may call\n   out, \"Privilege!\" after making his own move.  On claim of Privilege,\n   the opponent who would ordinarily move next must yield his turn to\n   the other member of the \"Privileged\" team, giving the Privileged team\n   two successive plays.\n\n   The player to move next will be the partner of the opponent who\n   yielded his turn.  If the opponents have not been defeated by the\n   Privilege move, they may take their own Privilege at that point or\n   later in the game.\n\n   Privilege is invoked primarily for defensive reasons.  If this option\n   is carefully planned by well-matched teams, it can make Double TwixT\n   a fast, challenging game.\n\n----------\n</pre>\n\nMe again. \n\n<p>Note 1. These rules ALLOW the removal of some of your structure\nat the beginning of your move. The ramifications of this have\nalready been discussed in another thread on this newsgroup.</p>\n\n<p>Note 2. The rules make no mention of play in the corners,\ndespite their existence in the AH board. A cutthroat variation is\nto allow play in the opponent's border row, with a corner being a\nlegal border connection for either player.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the basic strategy session from the AH rules:</p>\n\n<pre>\n----------\n\nBASIC SETUPS\n\nA setup is a planned pattern of pegging which permits the player to\ndouble-link in either of two directions during the third move.\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . *2. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2x . . . . . . . .\n. . . ./.\\. . . . . . _-*2. . . . . _-*2. . . . . . _-*-_ . . . . . . .\n. . . o3. o3. . . .3o-./. . . . .3o-. .\\. . . . .3o-_ . _-o3. . . . . .\n. . . .\\./x . . . x/_-o3. . . . . x\\. _-o3. . . . . .-*-. . . . . . . .\n. . . x *1. . . .1*-. x . . . . . .1*-x . . . . . . . x1. . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n      Beam         Tilt            Coign            Mesh\n    (3 holes,    (2 holes,       (diagonal        (1 hole,\n    straight)    diagonal)       of 8-holed       straight)\n                                 rectangle)\n\nPegs are numbered in order of placement.  In the third move (o) of any\nsetup, a player can both peg and double-link.\n\nGenerally, it is easier to concentrate on the placement of the second\npeg, rather than the whole pattern.  If the second peg is placed the\ncorrect distance from the first, the alternate locations for the third\npeg will be obvious.\n\nThe most important part of the strategy of a setup is to avoid wasting a\nmove.  Do not place the third peg until your opponent moves to bar one\nof your linking alternatives.  Instead, concentrate on building another\nsection of your barrier.\n\nA setup can be foiled if the other player moves to block it immediately\nafter the first peg of the setup is placed.  Such foils are extensive;\nsome possibilities are indicated by x on the diagrams.  A well-placed\nlinking move is the simplest foil for a setup.\n\n----------\n</pre>\n\nThe AH rules also include a sample game on a reduced board which I\nam not going to reproduce, except to note that the reduced board is\n12x12 instead of 24x24, and does NOT show the existence of corner\nholes. \n\n<p>Despite the game clearly not being as complex as GO, much of the\nterminology of GO applies well to its strategy. The section above\ncovers the introduction to \"connecting\" and \"making shape\". Other\nterms which have broad application across many abstract games, such\nas \"sente\", also work here.</p>\n\n<p>The Beam and the Tilt are the best setups for moving quickly\nacross the board, but can be attacked easily by the x moves shown,\namong others. The Coign is much more solid, the only direct block\nbeing a connection across the points marked x in that diagram. The\nMesh and the unmentioned \"Anti-Tilt\" (consider the o moves in the\nTilt diagram to be 1 and 2, followed by either of the * moves as\nthe double-link) are to be remembered as methods to connect pegs\nthat were originally placed as defensive or blocking moves.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas the first three (which I call \"long\") are usually\nattacked by building a barrier between pegs 1 and 2, the last two\n(\"short\") can be attacked effectively by blocking their possible\nconnections to the double-link spots _without_ actually separating\nthem with a barrier (this is the intention of the x moves on the\n\"mesh\" diagram; a \"beam\" connection between the x's would smother a\npossible connection on that side). In tight situations this attack\ncould be used against the long setups also.</p>\n\n<p>The primary weakness of long setups is the inability to link\nthem end-to-end. In the situations below the moves x will quickly\nlead to tight fighting and should be given consideration regardless\nof the relation of x to the rest of your pegs, due to the\ndevastation they will cause in the opponent's barrier.</p>\n\n<pre>\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . * . . . * . . . * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * . . . * . . . . .\n. . . x . . x . . x x . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . x . . x . . * . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . x . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . * . . . . . * . . x . . * . . . . . . . . . .\n. . * . . . . . . . . . x . . . . . . x . . * . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . x x x . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . * . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n  Beam Beam   Beam   Tilt  Tilt  Tilt  Coign Coign Coign Beam Coign\n</pre>\n\nA possible proverb: \"Play inside the angle of linked setups\". \n\n<p>The one exception to this rule is the linear Coign-Coign link,\nwhich does not appear to have a single devastating countermove. I\nhave not completed this analysis, but it seems that a similar\nresult can be shown for short setups and for combinations, but is\ncomplicated by the possibility of smothering attacks as well as\ncuts.</p>\n\n<p>The GO proverb \"Do not touch what you are attacking\" also\napplies to Twixt, although in a different sense that is difficult\nto define. If your opponent has a free end heading straight towards\nher border it is already too late to try to set up just one barrier\nto block her. You should skip at least 3 holes away ahead of her to\nstart setting up a more extensive wall. (This is the area that I am\nvery fuzzy in and will expect to see the most advances in, similar\nto the development of chess openings or GO joseki.) Conversely, an\nopponent who plays too closely to your free end is giving you a\ngift by letting you either (a) choose which way to go around it\nwith a single-link move or (b) make move 2 of a setup on the other\nside of her peg, forcing her to make the decision of which\ndouble-link connection to block.</p>\n\n<pre>\n-- Jon Ferro               Einsprachigkeit ist heilbar\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href=\n\"mailto:twixt@cstone.net\">dbush@csugrad.cs.vt.edu</a> (David Bush)\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     rec.games.abstract\n<b>Subject:</b>        A small TwixT game\n<b>Summary:</b>        An annotated game on a 12x12 board, and some generalities.\n<b>Keywords:</b>       twixt\n<b>Date:</b>           19 Nov 92 02:24:07 GMT\n<b>Organization:</b>   Virginia Tech Computer Science Dept, Blacksburg, VA\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\nHere's a sample \"game\" I made up on a 12x12 TwixT board: \n\n<pre>\n                       RED\n\n        A   B   C   D   E   F   G   H   I   J   K   L\n    1       .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .\n\n    2   .

G6             A solid opening move. By playing midway between the red\n               borders, red is making black's task as difficult as possible.\n1.      G8      On a larger board, this might be too close to the red peg,\n               but black's game is already desperate. Black might have tried\n               G10 instead, after which 2.E9,G4;3.E5(linking G6),D9;\n               4.C8(linking E9),E11(G10,D9);5.B10(C8),D3;6.D2 (red wins) is\n               one possible continuation.\n2. C8            Red gets in black's face. Playing 4 holes away from your\n               opponent's peg like this is frequently a good blocking move\n               to make, particularly when the move is supported by a nearby\n               peg as it is here.\n2.      G4       Black follows the opening maxim: \"Don't start a fistfight\n                too soon.\" Simply playing E7 loses to 3.D6(C8),D5(E7);\n                4.C4(D6) and red will win the race to the wall. Note that\n                in this variation, red's G6 peg is not part of the final\n                bridge. It's perfectly okay to abandon pegs this way.\n                 Black might have played F4, after which one continuation is\n               3.E5(G6),D5(F4);4.C6(E5) and red is unstoppable.\n3.C4             The C4-C8 pegs form what is called a \"setup,\" which means\n               they threaten to link together in one move in two different\n               ways. C4-G6 also threatens to link in one move, but they can\n                only link via E5, so this is not a setup.\n3.      B8     Black tries to make two threats at once. Now we're in the\n              middle game (things move along quickly on a quarter board.)\n4.E7          (linking G6,C8): the best move. Red covers both threats at\n              once. If for example red had played D6(C4,C8) then\n              4. ... D9(B8);5.G10,E7(G8,D9);6.H8(G6,G10),F6(G4,G8) and black\n              has a win. Or if 4.E9(C8),D7(B8);5.E7(C8,G6),F6(G4,D7).\n4.      D9    (linking B8): the only move, not that it matters.\n5.G10         Now it's red's turn to make two threats at once.\n5.      H6    (link G4,G8)  Black is just going through the motions.\n6.F8          (link G10,G6) E9 was also possible.\n6.     E4\n7.D6(C4,C8),C3(E4);\n8.B2(C4)             Black resigns.\n</pre>\n\nHere are some pithy aphorisms about the game: \n\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes the best offense is a good defense. See red's move #2\nabove. By falling back to block, red tries to have a \"net\" built by\nthe time black gets there.</li>\n\n<li>In the opening, keep the whole board in mind. Don't get drawn\ninto a local battle if a distant move would help your position\nmore. Remember just because you put some pegs down doesn't mean\nthey have to be part of your final bridge.</li>\n\n<li>Develop an eye for the \"diagonals\"- for example in the game\nabove, the line B2-C4-D6... was very important for red. In a \"race\"\nsuch as in the analysis to black's 2nd move, being at least on such\na crucial diagonal means you will win the race to the wall.</li>\n</ul>\n\nHANDICAPS AND EQUALIZATION \n\n<p>As the above game demonstrates, red has a powerful initiative.\nBetween strong players of equal strength, this may mean that red\nwill win more often than not. Here's a ritual the players can go\nthrough that is intended to equalize the game- make it more\nbalanced. On an otherwise empty board, one player puts down two red\npegs (which might be linked) and one black peg, producing a\nposition with black to move. The other player then decides which\nside to play. Play then proceeds from this position. The red pegs\nshould be placed less than ideally (although not abysmally),\nwhereas black's peg is well placed, producing a position that is as\nclose to even as the \"placer\" can make it.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it is more likely that there will be a\nconsiderable disparity between the players. In order to compensate,\nhere's a possible way to handicap the game: reduce the width of the\nplaying field, so that black (the weaker player) has less distance\nto bridge than red. With an actual game set, this might be\naccomplished with a black rubber band of the right size. A \"half\nboard\" game (12x24) is a pretty severe handicap. Reducing black's\ndistance from 24 to 23, on the other hand, just might serve to\nbalance out red's first-move initiative! I have no idea if this is\ntrue. If it is, that would render my proposed \"placer-chooser\"\nritual unnecessary.</p>\n\n<pre>\nDavid Bush        Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA    <a href= \n\"mailto:twixt@cstone.net\">dbush@csugrad.cs.vt.edu</a>\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     rec.games.abstract\n<b>From:</b>           <a href= \n\"mailto:sillke@math25.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de\">sillke@math25.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de</a> (Torsten Sillke)\n<b>Subject:</b>        TWiXT for experts\n<b>Date:</b>           Sat, 21 Nov 1992 13:30:25 GMT\n<b>Organization:</b>   Math MadHouse Bielefeld, Germany\n<b>Keywords:</b>       twixt, Twixt, tournament, books, addesses\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\nThere exists two booklets about TWiXT. \n\n<ol>\n<li>Andreas Kleinhans<br>\n TWiXT (Ein Klassiker von Alex Randolph)<br>\n Kleines Twixt-Expertenheft (a small booklet for the experts of\ntwixt)<br>\n pp 35, Mai 1990, KLEE-SPIELE GmbH<br>\n (you can get it for nothing)</li>\n\n<li>Vierzig Twixt-Aufgaben (40 Twixt problems)<br>\n Fuer Spieler, die ihre Taktik auf schnelle Weise verbessern\nwollen<br>\n pp 83, KLEE-SPIELE GmbH, (T.

I'm a fanatic about Twixt. The search\nengine 'Web Crawler' led me to your web site. I was pleased to see\npast postings about Twixt given a (more or less) lasting home for\nthe curious to peruse. One of the postings (the annotated\nquarter-board game) was mine, in fact.</p>\n\n<p>However, despite the plethora of inputs regarding the correct\nrules, there is one more rule that was left out: the \"swap rule,\"\nWhich Alex Randolph (the game's inventor) calls the \"pie rule.\"\nJonathan Ferro's verbatim posting of the rules from an Avalon Hill\nset were surely accurate; unfortunately, AH didn't quite get it\nright either, ignoring the \"pie rule.\" I have been in direct\ncorrespondence with Mr. Randolph, and I assure you, the following\nrules are correct:</p>\n\n<p>The board is a 24x24 square grid of holes, MINUS THE CORNER\nHOLES. (If the AH set has corner holes, then AH got that wrong as\nwell.) The rows along the edges are referred to as \"border rows.\"\nThe 'top' and 'bottom' rows are Red's border rows. The 'left' and\n'right' rows are Black's border rows. (European sets may use\ndifferent colors.) The board is empty at the start. Red moves\nfirst. Each move in Twixt consists of three stages:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Place one peg of your color in any vacant hole EXCEPT in either\nof your opponent's border rows.</li>\n\n<li>Remove as many of your OWN links (which were placed on previous\nmoves) as you wish to remove.</li>\n\n<li>Place as many legal links between pegs of your color as you\nwish. A link may be placed ONLY between pegs which are at opposite\ncorners of a six-hole rectangle (like a knight's move in chess).\nYour links may not cross any other link, not even one of your\nown.</li>\n</ol>\n\n(Note there is no mention made of PEG removal. This is a minor\nissue; supposedly, AH mentions peg removal in case you happen to be\nrunning out of them. But with at least 40 pegs &amp; links for each\nplayer, running out is extremely unlikely. There is no strategic\nadvantage that I can see in removing your own pegs.) \n\n<p>After Red places the first peg on the board, the second player\nhas the option of either responding normally as Black, or swapping\nsides. If sides are swapped, the player who moved first as Red is\nnow Black, and makes the next move. Sides may be swapped only once\nper game. If the second player does not swap immediately after the\nRed places the first peg, sides may not be swapped at all that\ngame. (This is Alex Randolph's \"pie rule,\" so named because it is\nlike \"I cut the pie, you choose the slice.\" It is also called\none-move equalization, and can be adapted to balance many\ntwo-player games.)</p>\n\n<p>The object is to connect your border rows with an UNINTERRUPTED\nchain of linked pegs. If neither side can complete such a chain,\nthe game is a draw.</p>\n\n<p>The 3M and AH sets include rules for \"double Twixt,\" as Mr.\nFerro described, but as far as I know, this is not Alex Randolph's\nidea. It could be; I didn't ask him.</p>\n\n<p>I also refer you to the website at <a href= \n\"http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/#twixt\">\nwww.gamerz.net/pbmserv/#twixt</a> for more info, including some\ncool puzzles written by Randolph!</p>\n\n<p>Now we're almost ready to talk about Twixt theory, but first, I\nwant to describe a notation system for making moves. The \"European\"\ncoordinate system is what I will use here.</p>\n\n<p>The rows are lettered A to X, and the columns are numbered 1 to\n24. Red has border rows at A and X. That is, the holes A2 ... A23\nand X2 ... X23 are the Red border rows. Black's border rows are 1\nand 24. That is, the holes B1 ... W1 and B24 ... W24 are the Black\nborder rows. Red's moves are numbered 1, 3, 5, ... Black's moves\nare numbered 2, 4, 6, ...</p>\n\n<p>Normally, a move is described by the coordinates where the peg\nis placed. An asterisk is placed after these coordinates for each\nlink which is made to that peg. There should be precisely as many\nasterisks as there are possible links to the peg just placed,\nwithout removing any previous links. Since you always have the\noption of removing your links later, most moves automatically\ninvolve making all possible links to the peg just played.</p>\n\n<p>Once in a rare while, however, you may have to remove some of\nyour links in order to avoid a draw (or even to avoid a loss.) Some\nof the puzzle problems illustrate this theme. Here is a syntax for\ndescribing all types of moves:</p>\n\n<pre>\nNOTE:  the bar | means \"or.\"\n       brackets [] mean \"what is enclosed is optional.\"\n</pre>\n\nEach &lt;move&gt; is one of the following forms: \n\n<pre>\n&lt;move&gt;       = &lt;simplemove&gt; | &lt;messymove&gt;\n\n&lt;simplemove&gt; = &lt;coordinates&gt; &lt;asterisks&gt;\n\n&lt;messymove&gt;  = &lt;coordinates&gt; [ - &lt;unlink list&gt; ] + [ &lt;link list&gt; ]\n\n&lt;coordinates&gt;= &lt;letter A to X&gt; &lt;number 1 to 24&gt;\n\n&lt;asterisks&gt;  = * [ &lt;asterisks&gt; ]\n</pre>\n\nBoth types of &lt;list&gt; are of the form \n\n<pre>\n  &lt;coordinates&gt; &lt;coordinates&gt; [ &lt;coordinates&gt; ... ][ , &lt;list&gt; ]\n</pre>\n\nEach string of coordinates in a list indicates a \"chain\" of pegs to\nlink or unlink. Commas are used as delimiters between each chain. \n\n<p>If you choose to make no links on your move, even though you\ncould link to the peg just played, this is indicated by the +\nsymbol with nothing after it.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example of a messy move. The diagrams need to be\nviewed with a non-proportional font such as Courier.</p>\n\n<p>Before move:</p>\n\n<pre>\n   3  4  5  6  7  8  9\n G .  O  .  # _O  O  .\n       \\  _---     \\\n H .  .| O  .  O_ .| #    Only part of the board is shown here.\n        \\        ---\\ \n I .  .

O  .  .  #  .  .\n</pre>\n\nOkay! Now we can talk theory. Jon Ferro talks about \"setups,\" using\nterminology from the AH set: \n\n<pre>\n&gt;BASIC SETUPS\n&gt;\n&gt;A setup is a planned pattern of pegging which permits the player to\n&gt;double-link in either of two directions during the third move.\n&gt;\n&gt;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n&gt;. . . . *2. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2x . . . . . . .\n&gt;. . . ./.\\. . . . . . _-*2. . . . . _-*2. . . . . . _-*-_ . . . . . .\n&gt;. . . o3. o3. . . .3o-./. . . . .3o-. .\\. . . . .3o-_ . _-o3. . . . .\n&gt;. . . .\\./x . . . x/_-o3. . . . . x\\. _-o3. . . . . .-*-. . . . . . .\n&gt;. . . x *1. . . .1*-. x . . . . . .1*-x . . . . . . . x1. . . . . . .\n&gt;. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n&gt;\n&gt;      Beam         Tilt            Coign            Mesh\n&gt;    (3 holes,    (2 holes,       (diagonal        (1 hole,\n&gt;    straight)    diagonal)       of 8-holed       straight)\n&gt;                                 rectangle)\n&gt;\n&gt;Pegs are numbered in order of placement.  In the third move (o) of any\n&gt;setup, a player can both peg and double-link.\n</pre>\n\nIn the interest of completeness, it should be mentioned there is a\nfifth setup type. Just as the 'mesh' is the converse of the 'beam,'\nand the 'coign' is its own converse, there is a converse to the\n'tilt' which AH does not mention. Modify the Tilt diagram so that\nthe 3 spots are labeled 1 and 2, and label the 1 and 2 spots as 3.\nThis setup doesn't get you very far, but can be extremely important\nfor close-up battles. \n\n<p>Talking about setups is a good way to begin to get a handle on\ntactics, especially for understanding the concept of NOT WASTING\nMOVES. Setups are usually unassailable, unless the opponent can\nfind a way to threaten the setup AND ANOTHER PART OF YOUR POTENTIAL\nBRIDGE at the SAME TIME. Making two threats at once, or defending\ntwo threats at once, is what you should strive to do on every move.\nSo, if your opponent is not threatening your setup, you usually\nshould not waste precious time linking it up!</p>\n\n<p>The Beam setup is generally the one you should try for, if your\nopponent allows you to make it. I have played many games against\nnewbies who allowed me to march right across the board this way. In\nfact, the Beam is so strong, frequently the only way to block a peg\nis to play in the same hole that your opponent would play in to\nmake a Beam.</p>\n\n<p>There is a drawback to thinking strictly in terms of setups,\nhowever. Setups are just a part of the arsenal of weapons availble\nto you. From the very first move, you must PLAY THE WHOLE BOARD.\nHere is an example of a possible opening between two experienced\nplayers:</p>\n\n<pre>\n1.F7 (not swapped) 2.O10\n3.M16              4.P16\n5.R9               6.I16\n7.I21              8.F19\n</pre>\n\nNo links have been made so far. Instead, both players are spreading\ntheir pegs around the board, attempting to make as many threats as\npossible, while simultaneously dealing (hopefully) with the\nopponent's threats. Only one setup has been made so far (Black's\nI16-F19), and since neither of those pegs has a link leading away\nfrom the setup, this setup is potentially vulnerable. But no local\nsituation should overly concern either player at this point. Both\nsides should be prepared to abandon any pegs or links they have put\ndown, IF by doing so they can gain an OVERALL advantage. This is\nwhere Twixt bears another similarity to Go, where a stone is not\nnecessarily placed in order to absolutely define the limits of a\nplayer's territory, but instead might have a variety of purposes,\nsuch as maintining the initiative (sente), or forcing a local\nresponse and simultaneoulsy improving the position elsewhere on the\nboard. This long-distance effect is one of the most potent weapons\nyou can use in Twixt. I call this sort of move a \"Zwischenzug,\"\nwhich is German for \"intermediate move,\" and is a term commonly\nused by chess players. See my annotated game #1 at the\nabove-mentioned website for examples of such moves. \n\n<p>As far as writing a Twixt-playing program is concerned, I\nabsolutely agree with the general consensus that this is not an\neasy task. I have been trying to incorporate some of John Conway's\nideas in his book \"Winning Ways,\" specifically his discussion of\ntemperature and cooling. I haven't been making much headway. I\nsuspect a good Twixt engine would have to have access to a very\nlarge database of local positions before it would be able to \"merge\nthe analysis\" of several local positions into an overall board\nstrategy.</p>\n\n<p>Torsten Sillke mentions an interesting problem, which I\ninterpret to be: is a given input position a draw, or is it still\npossible for one side to complete a bridge? This might actually be\na feature you would like a Twixt server to have, so that the\nmachine can tell you if the position is a draw or not. In practice,\nhowever, if two players are strong enough to achieve a draw, they\nwould recognize the game was drawn long before all possible paths\nare actually blocked.</p>\n\n<p>Well, enough blathering. Thanks for your time and patience!</p>\n\n<pre>\nDavid Bush\n<a href=\"mailto:twixt@cstone.net\">gbbush@rockbridge.net</a>\n</pre>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
