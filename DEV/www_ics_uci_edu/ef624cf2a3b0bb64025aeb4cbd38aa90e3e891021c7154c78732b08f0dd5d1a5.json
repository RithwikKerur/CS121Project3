If you have to miss lecture for any\r\nreason, please ask one of your classmates to fill you\r\nin on what you missed.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are four discussion sections for this class. Each section meets two hours per\r\nweek. This is an important time to get questions answered about homework\r\nproblems. No new content will be given in discussion and we do not take attendance, but you are highly encouraged to\r\nattend as it will give valuable practice on problems.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Piazza\">Piazza</a></h3>\r\n<p>\r\nWe will use an online question and answer service called Piazza.\r\nYou will all have an account.\r\nThe link to the to the course page on Piazza is:\r\n<a href=\"https://piazza.com/university_of_california_irvine/winter2015/ics6b/home\">\r\nhttps://piazza.com/university_of_california_irvine/winter2015/ics6b/home</a>.\r\nIf you have a question about course content, you can go to see if it\r\nhas already been asked by another students.\r\nIf not, you can post the question yourself.\r\nThe course staff will be checking Piazza several times a day\r\nto update answers to questions posted there.\r\nThere is also a way for students to collectively edit a response\r\nto a question and for instructors to indicate whether the answer\r\nis a good/correct answer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiazza is also a good place to post general\r\nadnministrative questions about the class.\r\nIf you send me an email with a technical question about the class,\r\nI am likely to refer you to Piazza.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nImportant class announcements will also be posted on Piazza. You are responsible\r\nfor checking for course announcements at least twice a week.\r\nOnly time ciritical announcements will generate an email.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBefore posting a question on Piazza, you should look through the course\r\nmaterials or previous Piazza posts\r\nto see if you can find the answer to your question.\r\nIf your question is about the technical content of the course,\r\ncheck the text. If you have an administrative question, check the\r\ncourse web page (either the home page with the schedule or this course information page).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nPiazza provides a way for you to\r\npost anonymously. However, your posts will only be anonymous to other students.\r\nThe instructors will be able to see the name and uciNetID of any individual\r\nwho posts to Piazza.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Assistance\"> Obtaining assistance</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTbe best way to get your questions answered is by coming\r\nto lecture, office hours or discussion and asking them there.\r\nIn particular, office hours and discussion are  the best place to ask questions that\r\nrequire a longer answer or some diaglog to get resolved.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe table below shows where to go to for different kinds\r\nof questions. Please try to follow the directions there.\r\n I really do want to be available for significant problems or issues that may arise.\r\n I also really enjoy meeting students in my office hours.\r\n However, with a class this size, the  amount of email generated from\r\n smaller, routine questions can be overwhelming, so I would like you\r\n to try and find that answer through other sources first.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<table border>\r\n<tr>\r\n\r\n<th>\r\nQuestion type\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nExample\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\nWhere to go\r\n</th>\r\n<th>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nQuestions about course content\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nWhat's the difference between (x,y) and {x,y}?\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nTry and find the answer to your question through the course materials.<br/>\r\nIf your question is not answered, then <br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://piazza.com\" target=\"_blank\">Post on Piazza</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nGeneral administrative questions\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nWhat topics does quiz 1 cover?\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nCheck the course web page (schedule and course information) first.<br/>\r\nIf your question is not answered, then <br/>\r\n<a href=\"https://piazza.com\" target=\"_blank\">Post on Piazza</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nQuestions on how your quiz was graded.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nI don't understand why I didn't get full credit on the first question.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nOffice hours of the TA who graded that quiz</br>\r\n(TAs will post on Piazza who graded which quiz.</br>\r\nOffice hours are listed <a href=\"courseinfo.html\">here.</a>)\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nQuestions on how your homework was graded.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nI don't understand why I didn't get full credit on the first question.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nOffice hours of the reader who graded that quiz</br>\r\n(Readers will post on Piazza who graded which homework.</br>\r\nOffice hours are listed <a href=\"courseinfo.html\">here.</a>)\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nMinor bug in the text.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nShouldn't the last line of this animation be x<sub>2</sub> instead of x<sub>1</sub>?\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\nUse the feedback button in the text.\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nTechnical problem you are having with the text.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nWhy doesn't the text show 100% progress for Section 1.2? </br>\r\nI think I did all the activities in the section.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\n<a href=\"mailto:support@zyBooks.com\">support@zyBooks.com</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nMajor issue reading the text.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nNone of the mathematical formulas are showing up in Section 1.4.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\n<a href=\"mailto:support@zyBooks.com\">support@zyBooks.com</a></br>\r\nand cc <a href=\"mailto:irani@ics.uci.edu\">irani@ics.uci.edu</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\nMistake in HW or HW solutions.\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\nI think the answer to question 3 on HW 2 should be 56 and not 57.\r\n</td>\r\n<td align=center>\r\n<a href=\"mailto:irani@ics.uci.edu\">irani@ics.uci.edu</a>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Grading\">Grading</a></h3>\r\n\r\nThe grading criteria for the course is:\r\n<ul>\r\nHomework 5%<br/>\r\nReading Assignments 4%<br/>\r\nQuizzes 60%<br>\r\nFinal 30%<br>\r\nCompleting the Course Evaluation 1%<br>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\nI am frequently asked whether I curve the grades. The answer to this question will\r\nalways be \"I don't know\".\r\nFirst of all, no letter grades are assigned to scores until I calculate a final course\r\npercentage for each student. I generally do aim to have the A's fall in the 90-100 range\r\nand the B's in the 80-90 range, etc. Sometimes I am a bit more generous that that, depending\r\non the distribution of scores. Occasionally I give a quiz or final that is harder than I\r\nexpect. In those circumstances, I will sometimes make a problem count as extra credit.\r\nThe best strategy for success is not to think too much about your grade but to continually\r\ndo your best to understand the material in the class.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Quizzes\">Quizzes</a></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nA quiz will be given  every week, starting in week 3.\r\nQuizzes will typically be given on Monday.\r\nHowever, there are two Monday holidays this quarter. In those weeks, the quiz will be given on\r\nWednesday instead.\r\nThe quizzes will be given at the end of lecture and will last approximately 20\r\nminutes. In calculating your grade, I use only the top  six  scores from the eight quizzes.\r\nIn exchnage for this, <b>I give absolutely no make up quizzes, regardless of the reason</b>.\r\nIt is understandable that there are sometimes circumstances beyond your control that\r\nmake it necessary to miss a quiz. The dropped quizzes are designed to cover\r\nsuch occasions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The topics covered in each quiz are tied to a particular homework. For example, quiz 1 will\r\ncover the topics covered in  homework 1. Each homework will indicate which sections in  the book\r\nare covered  by that homework. The topics covered on the homework are a good guide to the topics\r\nthat will be covered on the quiz. However, the problems on the quizzes will not exactly match a question\r\non the homework. In particular, I will also draw on examples covered in class to use for the quizzes.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI generally do not post the solutions to quizzes online. You are expected to get clarification on\r\nquiz solutions by attending discussion or office hours and asking questions.\r\nTowards the end of the quarter, I will post the quizzes (without solutions) so that you can use them\r\nto study for the final exam.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSome of the quzzes will be multiple choice and some will be written short answer.\r\nI will not announce the format in advance. You just need to be prepared to take\r\na quiz on the topics covered.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe only thing you need to have for quizzes and the final exam is a pen or pencil for writing.\r\nAll scantron forms and/or paper will be provided.\r\nNo electronic devices (inclusing calculators) are allowed in quizzes or exams.\r\nThere should be no visible screens during a quiz or exam.\r\nLaptops should be closed and tablets should be in a closed folder or stowed in a bag.\r\nPhones should be stowed in a bag or pocket so that they are not visible at all.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Homework\">Homework</a></h3>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nHomework is due every Wednesday, starting in week 2.\r\nThere will be a dropbox labeled \"ICS 6B\" on the third floor of Bren Hall\r\n3013 where you should drop it off. You must hand it in before the start of lecture because one of the\r\nreaders will pick it up during lecture.<strong> Absolutely no late homework assignments will be accepted.\r\n</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou will notice that the homework counts very little towards your grade.\r\nIt is important to do the homework because it enables you to learn the material but a missed\r\nhomework will not have a big effect on your grade.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nGrades for the assignements and quizzes will be posted through EEE.\r\nIf you have questions regarding grading, please see the reader or TA who graded that assignment.\r\nThe readers and TAs will be posting on Piazza when quiz grades and homework scores are ready so you will\r\nknow who graded which assignments.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI will post solutions to the homework so that you can use them to study for the quiz.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"Text\">Text</a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThis quarter you will be using a web-based interactive, animated offering as your \"textbook\".\r\nYou are required to have an account for the course. The material\r\nincludes interactive\r\nexercises which will count towards your grade.\r\nThe directions for subscribing can be found at:\r\n<ol><li> Go to <a href=\"https://zybooks.zyante.com/#/zybooks\">https://zybooks.zyante.com/#/zybooks</a>.\r\nBookmark this site - this is your site for the entire quarter.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nYou will need a\r\ncredit card or Paypal account to pay the subscription price of $40.\r\nNote: a Paypal account is not required.\r\nIf you don't have a credit card or a Paypal account, contact <a href=\"mailto:support@zyBooks.com\">\r\nsupport@zyBooks.com</a>.\r\nContact <a href=\"mailto:support@zyBooks.com\">\r\nsupport@zyBooks.com</a> for help or with any questions regarding obtaining a subscription.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYour reading for this class is associated with your subscription for the winter offering of\r\nICS 6B, so  you will need a new subscription even if you have had a previous subscription\r\nto the Discrete Math zyBook for some other class.\r\nHowever, if your subscription to the Discrete Math zyBook occurred in the last year (or currently\r\nfor another class), you can\r\ncontact support@zybooks.com to get a discount code which will allow you to get your subscription\r\nat a 50% rate. You will need to provide the zyBook code for the previous subscription and for\r\nthis class. The zyBook code for this class is UCIICS6BWinter2015.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you drop the class in the first two weeks, you can contact support@zyBooks.com to get\r\na full refund for the text.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"ReadingCredit\">Credit for reading</a></h3>\r\n<p>\r\nEach reading assignment is due at 2PM the day it is assigned.\r\nEvery action through your zyBook is automatically timestamped.\r\nWhen I compile grades for reading, I determine how much\r\nof your  reading was completed by a particular day and time,\r\nso the deadlines are automatically enforced.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nYou can determine how much of the reading has been completed\r\nby looking at your zyBook dashboard.\r\nPlease familiarize yourself with this interface and make sure\r\nthat you have 100% completion by 2PM for the sections assigned each\r\nlecture day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI do make an exception to the due dates for the first two weeks of classes\r\nwhile course enrollment is fluctuating. The reading assignments for the first two\r\nweeks are all due by 2PM on Monday January 19. However, I strongly advise you\r\nto do the reading assigned before each lecture since the lectures are\r\ndesigned for students who already have some familiarity with the\r\ntopics in the reading.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a name=\"BoardNotes\">Board notes</a></h3>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter lecture, I will post the board notes generated during lecture.\r\nThe purpose of posting the notes is to the reduce the amount of\r\nnote taking you need to be doing in class. The best way to learn this material\r\nis to attend class and concentrate on what is being said.\r\nHaving the board notes provided means that you can spend more time\r\nthinking about the content of the lectures and less time copying down\r\nwhat is being written.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe board notes are not intended to be a perfectly readable\r\ntranscript for everyting that took place in class.\r\nYou will still  have to take some additional notes\r\nbased on the discussion in class.\r\nThe board notes are definitely not a substitute for attending class.\r\nThey merely serve to reduce the amount of writing you need to\r\ndo while you are in class.\r\nIf you are sitting in lecture and you can not read something I have\r\nwritten, please raise your hand and ask for clarification.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you are unable to attend class for some reason, you should not\r\nexpect the board notes to be sufficient to decipher the material I covered.\r\nYou need to contact a fellow classmate to get his or her\r\nnotes and possibly follow up in discussion with questions.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<H3><a name=\"MissedFinal\">Missed  Final Exam Policy</a></H3>\r\nThe final exam will be held on Friday March 20, 1:30PM-3:30PM.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI> If you miss the final exam and do not have a valid reason, you will receive\r\na score of 0 on the exam.\r\n<LI> The following policy applies if you miss the final exam for a valid reason.\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>\r\nThere are only two classes of valid reasons for missing the final exam:\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI>  An unforeseeable emergency, such as a medical emergency.\r\nIn such cases I will ask for documentation.\r\n<LI> An absence from an exam due to a foreseeable circumstance\r\nthat I have approved in advance.\r\n</OL>\r\n<LI>\r\nA work conflict or a family vacation is NOT a valid reason for missing the final exam.\r\n<LI> If you wait until after the exam to get a foreseeable excuse approved,\r\nand it is not approved,\r\nyou will receive a grade of zero (0) on the exam.\r\n<LI> If I accept your reason for missing the final exam, at my option I may\r\neither (1) give you a makeup exam or (2) assign your grade on the basis\r\nof the remaining course work that you did not miss.\r\n<LI> If I give a makeup exam, I may give it less weight\r\nthan announced on the course web page.\r\n</UL>\r\n</UL>\r\n\r\n  <h3><a name=\"AcademicHonesty\">Academic Honesty</a></h3>\r\n    <p>The Bren School of ICS and the University have already established an academic honesty policy. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/policies/#03\">Read it.</a></p>\r\n    <p>Violators of academic honesty policies are subject to the penalties described in the Bren School of ICS policy. They are also subject to an immediate course grade of F, and you will not be allowed to drop the course to avoid the grade. Also be aware that a single documented case of academic dishonesty may preclude you from switching into computing majors, registering for computing minors, joining the ICS Honors Program, and graduating from a computing major with honors.</p>\r\n    <h4>Guidelines to avoid plagarism:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>Do not look at another person's homework.</b>\r\n      Instead you should prefer to discuss the problem in plain English.\r\n      This helps you to communicate clearly, practice technical jargon as it applies to your problem, and to identify how your solution exhibits behavior different from what you expect.\r\n      <li><b>Do not write down the solution in your notes.</b>\r\n      It is perfectly fine (and encouraged) to collborate on work.\r\n      Working in a group is a rewarding experience, and definitely a necessary skill in any professional career.\r\n      The collaboration can include drawing diagrams and perhaps solving the problem on a whiteboard.\r\n      However, you should avoid writing the solution in your notes.\r\n      It is very useful to rethink the problem and go through the details and logic when you solve it again on your own.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <h4>We expect that:</h4>\r\n    <ul>\r\n      <li><b>You can monitor each other and enforce these rules among yourselves.</b> Making sure that others follow these guidelines will help to ensure that they don't pass off your work as their own.</p>\r\n      <li><b>Your work honestly represents your efforts.</b> The entire purpose of obtaining an education is so that you can accumulate a body of skills and experience that will help you later on. If you do not perform the work yourself, then you have cheated yourself out of the education. Employers in our field can (and do) screen applicants for skills and knowledge. You will perform poorly (and discredit UCI) if you do not practice now by doing your own work.</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
