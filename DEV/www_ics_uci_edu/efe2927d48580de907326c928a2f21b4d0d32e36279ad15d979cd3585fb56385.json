We describe a general\nframework for answering such queries based on a novel use of data\nstreaming sketches we call <b>signed symmetric-difference</b>\nsketches. We show that such sketches can be realized using invertible\nBloom filters (IBFs), which can be composed, differenced, and searched\nso as to solve set-difference range queries in a wide variety of\nscenarios.\n</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
