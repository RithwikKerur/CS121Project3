As <A HREF=\"refs.html#L62\">Lindgren</A>\nand <A HREF=\"refs.html#CL81\">Cassidy and Lord</A> showed, eight\ntriangles is best possible, and there exist alternate solutions with any\neven number of triangles larger than eight.\n\n<P>Recently, John Tromp added a new twist to the problem by <A HREF=\"postings.html\">asking on sci.math</A> how to make the angles as acute as possible.\nFor the eight-triangle solution, he found a placement of the vertices in\nwhich the maximum angle is only about 85 degrees, and asked if more\ntriangles would achieve even better angles.\n\n<P>My own involvement with the problem began several years earlier, with\nmy paper \"<A HREF=\"refs.html#BEG90\">Provably good mesh generation</A>\".\nOne of the ideas in that paper was to define certain \"tiles\" that could\nbe placed on the squares of a\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/gina/quadtree.html\">quadtree</A>, to form\nacute-angled triangulations.\n\n<P><CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"pgmg-tiles.gif\" WIDTH=243 HEIGHT=361 ALT=\"tiles for acute triangulation\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<IMG SRC=\"pgmg-example.gif\" WIDTH=217 HEIGHT=325 ALT=\"example of acute triangulation using tiles\">\n</CENTER>\n\n<P>The dashed lines mark the boundaries of the quadtree squares, and\nindicate that certain half-tiles can be recombined to form three more\ntiles, including one in which a square is divided into 26 triangles, all\nhaving angles of at most 80 degrees.  A larger image of the same square\ntile is shown below.  The example triangulation above (which has now\nbecome a standard test input in the sparse matrix algorithm community)\nuses all nine tile types, and also includes several other triangulated\nsquares with larger numbers of triangles.\n\n<P><CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"pgmg-square.gif\" WIDTH=217 HEIGHT=217 ALT=\"square tile partitioned into 26 acute triangles\">\n</CENTER>\n\n<P>Later, I and others showed that\n<A HREF=\"refs.html#BE91\">any polygon could be triangulated with\nnon-obtuse triangles</A>, and that in fact only <A\nHREF=\"refs.html#BMR94\">O(<I>n</I>) non-obtuse triangles suffice</A> to\ntriangulate an <I>n</I>-sided polygon.  However some polygons might\nrequire right angles or angles very close to 90 degrees.\n\n<P>Returning to Tromp's question on achieving better angles,\na result of <A HREF=\"refs.html#G84\">Gerver</A> implied that the square could\nbe partitioned into 72-degree triangles, not necessarily meeting\nedge-to-edge.  Could this 72-degree bound be achieved by a triangulation\nin which all triangles met edge to edge?\nOne can't do better than 72 degrees\nbecause (by some manipulations with\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/\">Euler's formula</A>) any triangulated\nsquare has (1) a vertex along a square edge where only two triangles\nmeet, (2) a square corner covered by only one triangle, or (3) an\ninterior vertex where at most five triangles meet.  Cases (1) and (2)\ngive at best 90 degrees, and case (3) gives at best 72.\n\n<P><CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"60-square.gif\" WIDTH=253 HEIGHT=253 ALT=\"square partitioned into 60 acute triangles\">\n</CENTER>\n\n<P>My first solution involved partitioning the square into three\nrectangles, each triangulated with 20 triangles, for a total of 60\ntriangles.  The ends of each rectangle are covered with one 54-54-72\ntriangle and two 36-72-72 triangles, and the middle is filled with\nsmaller triangles of varying shapes.  There is some \"stretch\" possible\nin the middle of the triangulation, so a similar solution can be used to\nfind 72-degree triangulations of any rectangle.\n\n<P>However, this is not best!  A fourteen triangle solution is possible.\n\n<P><CENTER>\n<IMG SRC=\"14-square.gif\" WIDTH=205 HEIGHT=205 ALT=\"square partitioned into 14 acute triangles\">\n</CENTER>\n\n<P>To construct this triangulation, place as guides two congruent regular\npentagons, meeting at a face, diagonally in the square (as large as\npossible, so that four of their corners touch the square's sides).  Use\nas triangulation vertices these four points on the square's sides, the\ntwo centers of the pentagons (on one diagonal of the square), and the\ntwo points on the other diagonal where the pentagons share a corner.\nThe triangulation has six 54-54-72 triangles (connecting each pentagon\ncenter to three pentagon edges), and eight 45-63-72 triangles (two at\neach corner of the square).\n\n<P>Is fourteen the minimum number of triangles in a 72-degree\ntriangulation of the square?\n\n<P><HR><P>\nFrom the <A HREF=\"/~eppstein/junkyard/\">Geometry Junkyard</A>,\ncomputational\nand recreational geometry.<BR>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~theory/\">Theory Group</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/\">ICS</A>,\n<A HREF=\"http://www.uci.edu/\">UC Irvine</A>.<P>\n<SMALL>Last update: <!--#flastmod file=\"index.html\" -->.</SMALL>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
