We present efficient methods for\nauthenticating fundamental set operations, such as <i>union</i> and\n<i>intersection</i> so that the client can verify the correctness of the\nreceived answer. Based on a novel extension of the security properties\nof <i>bilinear-map accumulators</i>, our authentication scheme is the\nfirst to achieve <i>optimality</i> in several critical performance\nmeasures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><i>The verification overhead at the client is optimal,</i>\nthat is, the client can verify an answer in time proportional to the\nsize of the query parameters and answer.</li>\n<li><i>The update overhead\nat the source is constant.</i></li>\n<li><i>The bandwidth consumption is optimal,</i> namely constant between\nthe source and the server and operation-sensitive between the client and\nthe server (i.e., proportional only to the size of the query parameters\nand the answer).</li>\n<li><i>The storage usage is optimal,</i> namely constant at the\nclient and linear at the source and the server.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Updates and queries are also efficient at the server. In contrast,\nexisting schemes entail high bandwidth and verification costs or high\nstorage usage since they recompute the query over authentic data or\nprecompute answers to all possible queries.</p>\n\n<p>We also show applications of our techniques to the authentication of\n<i>keyword searches</i> on outsourced document collections (e.g.,\ninverted-index queries) and of queries in outsourced <i>databases</i>\n(e.g., equi-join queries). Since set intersection is heavily used in\nthese applications, we obtain new authentication schemes that compare\nfavorably to existing approaches.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/455\">Joint work</a> with\nCharalampos Papamanthou and Nikos Triandopoulos.)\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
