The internet provides a \nlot of useful information about religion, and it can prove to be a \nuseful tool in helping someone, like myself, gain a better insight into \ndifferent religions of the world. I will provide links to places to find out more \ninformation about many different religions, but will concentrate on Christinanity and \nIslam. There are the two religions that I have interest in finding out more \ninformation.  This paper is by no means conclusive or exhaustive, but \nmearly a place to start for those that might need help in finding a good \nresource. So let's start to <A HREF=\"http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/\"> explore</A>!!!\n</P>\n<P>\n<A NAME=\"Christianity\"><H1>CHRISTIANITY</H1></A>\n<LI>Although, there are many different branches of Christianity, they do have\na few common beliefs among them.  And some would even say that they don't even have \nanything in common.  Well, the church has probably been hypocritcal at various times\n(mainly because we're all human, we all fail now and again...). But\nChristianity itself, as Jesus showed it, rises above this.\nChristianity is not about rules and regulations. It is about forgiveness and\nfreedom. Forgiveness for our rebellion from God. Freedom to live life\nto the full.\n</P>\n<p>\nIt's about God's son humbling himself to be born into this world.\nAbout Him going through what we go through.  It's about Jesus living a \nperfect live and dying, so that He can offer forgiveness for our \nimperfect lives, so we don't have to die.  It's about Jesus being raised \nto life on the third day, and about us being able to know God personally. \nNow maybe some people do not agree with all of these things, but they are \nissues that effect the world in which we live in today.  There are many \nChristian's in the world and many of these beliefs our in there world \nview.  We must at least attempt to understand what and why a Christian \nbelieves, in order to better understand the world in which we live in.\nIf you would like to see some <A HREF=\" \nhttp://www.transport.com/~kevinm/011sebr.html\">tips</A> on making \nChrist apart of your life.  \n</P>\nIf you would like to get more involved with\n<A HREF=\"http://www.intele.net/~bowserd/bible.html\"> learning</A>\n about the Christian church and their beliefs, there are several\n<A HREF=\" http://saturn.colorado.edu:8080/Christian/list.html\">\nresources</A> that can be found on the internet.  Christinanity has many beautiful \n<A HREF=\"http://www.christusrex.org/\">images and art</A>associated with the religion as \nwell, especially within the Catholic community.  \n\nIf anyone would would be interesting in learning about the\n<A HREF=\"file://gate.net/pub/users/copeland/html/ca/ca.html\">history</A> of\nChristinaity, there are several good connections on the net as well, just\nclick on history.  There are also many other interesting sources on the \nnet that help one to explore their budding religious beliefs.\nAn individual can also purchase information, including bibles and other\nsoftware, through the an online<A HREF=\"http://www.vir.com/bp/bp.htm>\nbookstore</A>. This is some very interesting information about the various\n<A HREF=\"http://tuna.uchicago.edu/homes/BIBLES.html\"></A>bibles\n</P>\n\n<A NAME=\"Islam\"><H1>ISLAM</H1></A>\n<p>\n<a HREF=\"http://www.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/~amueller/religion/islam.html\">Islam</a> is \nthe last of the great revealed religions and contains in itself \nthe essential principles of all earlier religions. Islam is a strongly monotheistic \nreligion with the worship of One God as its central theme. Islam requires its followers to \nbelieve in all earlier prophets and \n<A HREF=\"http://chestnut.enmu.edu/~stjeanp/quran.index.html\">      \nscriptures</a>, because according to Islam, all the great religions that\npreceded it were revealed by God. Sadly, most of the old scriptures have \nbeen changed and tampered with, leaving them doubtful. \n</p>\n<p>\nIslam is not a religion of an ethnic group or a specific nation, rather \nit is the religion for all mankind. The <a \nHREF=\"http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/Intro_To_Islam.html\">religion</a> is called \nIslam because it offers peace and requires complete submission to the Will of God. \nFor more islam resources please click on <A HREF=\"gopher://latif.com/11/islam\"></a>   \nIslam resources. <A HREF=\"http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/\">Islam</a> teaches that \nunless man learns to live at peace with himself and \nhis fellow human beings he cannot live at peace with God.

The islamic religion has some very interesting\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/HyPlans/ahmed/islam.html\"> articture and \nimages</a> that surround the religion, if you would like to take a look at some of \nthem, feel free to do so as you continue to explore. \n</P>\n<P>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/message.html\">\nMuhammad - The Prophet of Islam</A>\n\nHadhrat Muhammad (pboh) was born in Mecca (Arabia) in 570 AD and lived through\nthe first third of the seventh century.  For the purpose of communing with himself and \nimploring light and guidance from  the Supreme Being concerning the problems that \ntroubled his mind and soul, he made a habit of retiring for several days at a time to \none of the hills a few miles out of Mecca. There he occupied himself in prayer and \ncontemplation. Hadhrat Muhammad (pboh) was forty years old when the\nDivine call came to him in his retreat on Mount Hira. The very name of the\ngreat faith ushered in through Hadhrat Muhammad (pboh) was\nbestowed by God, as is affirmed by the <A \nHREF=\"http://www.utexas.edu/students/amso/quran_html/\"> Holy \nQuran</A>: \"This day have I perfected your religion for your benefit, and have completed\nMy favour unto you, and have chosen for you Islam as your faith.\" (5:4) \n\n<A NAME=\"Religion and the net\"><H1>The net and religion:  Some \nthoughts!</H1></A>\n\nPossible Effects of the Global Media Expansion on Spiritual Values\n\nNewspaper headlines have announced the arrival of the information \nsuperhighway. CD-ROMs, personal digital assistants, global telecommunications\nsatellites and the explosive growth of Internet users also contribute to \nthe headlines and news articles heralding not only a media revolution, \nbut a social revolution as well.\n<LI><p>\nThere are many good and bad things that one can attribute to religion over \nthe Internet.  Some of the good are, A much bigger view of the world and \nits people and the events affecting people, much more information, and A\nbroadening of horizons and a widening of perspectives.  Some of the bad \nare, a sense of lessening of control over these events, less \ninvolvement, feeling overwhelmed and disconnected, a greater sense of \npowerlessness and rootlessness.  Another That I can see happening is the \nrises in fundamentalism, due to the rapid change and outside influences.  \n</P>\nYet, greater interconnectedness of peoples and cultures that the internet \nbrings, may breed greater understanding, more frequent and meaningful contacts\nand cooperation among diverse groups of people: discoveries of mutual \ninterests and mutual respect.  The internet can help find ways to\nwork together to improve our lives, and our understand of not only the \nreligion that one may believe in but all of the religions of the world in \nwhich we live.  Affordable, user-friendly computers interconnected over vast\nhigh-speed global networks(The internet) can allow us so many \nopportunities \n</P>\nAn overriding concern is the continuation of ancient wisdom, ritual and \ntradition. The traditional practices of Christianity have \nlost much of their spiritual and mystical components as they have been \nembraced by western civilization even though they have survived for \nthousands of years. How can they, along with the hundreds of\nother religions and cultures around the world, retain their spiritual \nlegacies in the face of the media explosion which historically \ndisseminates predominantly western values? The Internet will not help \nin this process.  Through the enlightened dedication of each religion and\nculture's most adept scholars, practitioners and historians, translating \ntheir spiritual knowledge and wisdom to the new media, both audiovisual and data,\nthe future generations will have the opportunity to share in their ancestral heritage,\nin new and more exciting ways..<A\nHREF=\"(http://gopher.upenn.edu/rtvis/rtvis.html#summary\">reference</a>\n</P>\n<p>\n\"Training spiritual practitioners in how to use the new media \nshould become a high priority of the spiritual traditions within each \nculture. And through this process and traditions may be updated and transformed \nas they often as they need to be.  If religions want to get there message\nout then the internet is the wave of the future, and they should be \nprepared to handle the enormous response\".<A \nHREF=\"(http://gopher.upenn.edu/rtvis/rtvis.html#summary\">reference</a> \n</P>\n<H1>Conclusion</H1>\nThe information that one can find on the net, will provide any \nperson interested in learning more about the different religions \nin the world.
