In December 1993 the Web was ranked 11th of all network services in terms of sheer byte traffic - just twelve months earlier, its rank was 127.\n<p>\n\n<a name=\"i12\"><img src=\"graphics/chart.gif\" alt=\"\"></a>\n<p>\n<blockquote><i>Figure 3. World-Wide Web growth. Statistics available by FTP from <a href=\"ftp://nic.merit.edu/\"><code>nic.merit.edu</code></a>.</i></blockquote>\n<p>\n\nIn June 1993, <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/mkgray/www-home-page.html\">Matthew Gray</a> at <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/\">MIT</a> ran a small program which automatically travels links within the Web network to try to determine just how many sites there are that offer information over the World-Wide Web. His small <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/mkgray/web-growth.html\">\"World-Wide Web Wanderer\"</a> found around 100 sites that month and over two hundred thousand documents. In March 1994 his robot found over 1,200 unique sites. Even though the robot's programming was improved somewhat, and a number of factors may have affected the final count, the growth rate of the Web from the last half of 1993 throughout the first half of 1994 is amazing and continues to increase.\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/bp/bp.html\">Brian Pinkerton</a> at the University of Washington has been maintaining a similar program called the <a href=\"http://www.biotech.washington.edu/WebCrawler/WebCrawler.html\">\"WebCrawler\"</a>. Its last run in mid-May 1994 found over 3,800 unique Web sites.\n<p>\n\n<a name=\"i88\">Given</a> that many sites are private (hidden behind corporate firewalls or not connected to the public Internet), it can be safely stated that, as of May 1994, there are at least 4,500 hypertext Web servers in use throughout the world.\n<p>\n\n<a name=\"i89\">Based</a> on Web site statistics, estimates of the number of knowledgeable Web users in the world has been as large as two million. However, considering the number of hosts that frequent the most populated areas of the Web, it is safe to say that there are around 250,000 to 500,000 current active Web users today.\n\n<a name=\"1\"><h2>A Case Study - Honolulu Community College</h2></a>\n<p>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/\"><b>Honolulu Community College</b></a> <a name=\"i17\">officially</a> announced the opening of their hypermedia site - the first Web site in Hawaii and the first hypermedia campus-wide information system on the Web - at the end of May 1993. A campus dinosaur exhibit, interactive map, movies, and publications were offered there and immediately attracted an international audience.\n<p>\n\nBy September of that year (after 105 days of service), they had received over 23,000 requests for documents and over 112,000 requests for graphics and other media from nearly 5,000 separate hosts on the network. Today, the site receives about 7,000 requests per day on average, a large majority of which comes from outside Hawaii.\n<p>\n\nSince the site's opening, HCC has received virtual visitors from <a href=\"http://www.xerox.com/\">Xerox</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digital.com/\">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\">Apple Computer</a>, Cray, IBM, MIT's Media Lab, NEC, Sony, Fujitsu, Intel, <a href=\"http://www.rockwell.com/\">Rockwell</a>, Boeing, Honeywell, and AT&T (which has been one of the most frequent visitors), among hundreds of other corporate sites on the Internet.\n<p>\n\nCollegiate visitors have originated from campuses such as <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/\">Stanford</a>, Harvard, <a herf=\"http://cmu.edu/\">Carnegie-Mellon</a>, Cornell, <a href=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001\">MIT</a>, <a href=\"http://www.msu.edu/\">Michigan State</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rutgers.edu/\">Rutgers</a>, Purdue, <a href=\"http://riceinfo.rice.edu/\">Rice</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gatech.edu/\">Georgia Tech</a>, Columbia, <a href=\"http://wwwhost.cc.utexas.edu/\">University of Texas</a>, and Washington University, as well as other campuses in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Denmark, to name but a few.\n<p>\n\nGovernmental visitors have come from various departments in <a href=\"http://hypatia.gsfc.nasa.gov/NASA_homepage.html\">NASA</a>, including their <a href=\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/\">Jet Propulsion Laboratories</a>, <a href=\"http://www.llnl.gov/\">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/\">National Institute of Health</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.ssc.gov/SSC.html\">Superconducting Supercollider project</a>, and the USDA, as well as government sites in Singapore and Australia. A few dozen Army and Navy sites throughout the world also visited the site.\n<p>\n\nBecause HCC's service began operation when there were relatively few such sites in the world, and in part due to its popularity, their growth in traffic has closely reflected the growth of the Web.\n\n<a name=\"2\"><h2>The Popularity of Other Web Sites</h2></a>\n<p>\n\n<a name=\"i90\">The</a> <a href=\"http://www.ora.com/cgi-bin/ora/gnnservers/about\"><i>Global Network Navigator</i></a> is an electronic magazine published by O'Reilly and Associates over the World-Wide Web. It offers news, a calendar of Internet events, and a virtual marketplace in which companies can advertise their services. It has roughly 12,000 registered subscribers and receives about 150,000 to 200,000 requests for documents and media per week from people all over the Internet.\n<p>\n\nPerhaps the best example of the growth in Web usage can be seen at <a name=\"i45\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/\"><b>National Center for Supercomputing Applications</b></a> (<b>NCSA</b>). The NCSA produces a number of popular software products for World-Wide Web use and their Web site is used as documentation for their products as well as a repository for announcements of new events on the Web. In July 1993 NCSA's site received roughly 100,000 requests per week. Currently it receives at least one million requests per week and its traffic continues to increase.\n\n<a name=\"3\"><h2>Who Travels the Web?</h2></a>\n<p>\n\n<a name=\"i79\">An</a> informal comparison of host statistics from 15 government, research, educational, and corporate Web sites in March 1994 shows that the people roaming the World-Wide Web follow the makeup of the Internet fairly well.\n<p>\n\nShown are the top five Web users by domain and the average percentage of total hosts each Web site received. Next to these statistics is the estimated percentage of total hosts on the Internet for these domains.\n\n<h4>Table 1: Top Five World-Wide Web Users, by Domain</h4>\n<p>\n\n<img src=\"graphics/table.gif\" alt=\"\">\n<p>\n<blockquote><i>From January 1994 Stanford Research Institute (<a href=\"http://www.sri.com/\">SRI International</a>) statistics, available by FTP from <a href=\"ftp://nic.merit.edu/\"><code>nic.merit.edu</code></a>.</i></blockquote>\n<p>\n  \nIn January 1994, <a href=\"http://www.gatech.edu/gvu/people/Masters/Pitkow.html\">James Pitkow</a> (<code>pitkow@cc.gatech.edu</code>) and Mimi Recker at the <a href=\"http://www.gatech.edu/\">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> held the first <a href=\"http://www.gatech.edu/pitkow/survey/survey-1-1994.html\">World-Wide Web user survey</a>. Out of 1,300 valid responses, the results indicated the following statistics about the respondents:\n<p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> 56% were between the ages of 21 and 30,\n<li> 94% were male,\n<li> 69% were located in North America, and\n<li> 45% described themselves as professionals and 22% as graduate students.\n</ul>\n<p>\n\nAlthough it is impossible to know for sure, it can be guessed that the largest segment roaming the World-Wide Web consists of four-year campus populations within the United States.\n\n<a name=\"4\"><h2>Why Is The Web So Popular?</h2></a>\n<p>\n\nThe Web offers a very simple-to-use interface to the traditionally hard-to-master resources on the Internet. It is probably this ease of use as well as the popularity of many graphical interfaces to the Web that caused the explosion of Web traffic in 1993.\n<p>\n\nThe potential of using networked hypertext and multimedia has prompted many users to create and explore countless innovative applications on the Internet. It is perhaps no surprise that more educational users are on the Web than would be expected.\n<p>\n\n<img src=\"graphics/hr.gif\" alt=\"--\"><br>\n<a href=\"guide.04.html\"><img src=\"graphics/btn.back.gif\" alt=\"[Back]\"></a><a href=\"guide.toc.html\"><img src=\"graphics/btn.contents.gif\" alt=\"[Contents]\"></a><a href=\"guide.06.html\"><img src=\"graphics/btn.next.gif\" alt=\"[Next]\"></a>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
