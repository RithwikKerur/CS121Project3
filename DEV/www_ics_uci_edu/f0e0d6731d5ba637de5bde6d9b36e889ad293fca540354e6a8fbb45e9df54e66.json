Our algorithm is\nthe first cache-oblivious shortest-path algorithm incurring less than\none memory transfer per vertex if the graph is sparse (m = O(n)) and W\n= 2^o(B).\n<p>\nThis paper was authored by\nLuca Allulli, Peter Lichodzijewski, and Norbert Zeh,\nand appeared in SODA 2007.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
