We study the problem under the <i>streaming</i> variant,\nin which we may read the input only once and must use only a small\namount of memory. Our result uses the assumption of <i>data\nseparability</i>, which closely reflects how <i>k</i>-means is used in\npractice. We show a near-optimal streaming approximation algorithm for\n<i>k</i>-means with sublinear memory and a single pass, under the data\nseparability assumption. Our algorithm offers significant improvements\nin both space and running time over previous work while yielding\nasymptotically best-possible performance.  We also show several related\nresults, including a method to convert any constant approximation to be\nmore accurate on well-clusterable data.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Vladimir Braverman, Adam Meyerson, Rafail Ostrovsky,\nAlan Roytman, and Brian Tagiku, <a href=\"http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~shindler/StreamingKMeans_soda11.pdf\">to appear at SODA 2011</a>.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
