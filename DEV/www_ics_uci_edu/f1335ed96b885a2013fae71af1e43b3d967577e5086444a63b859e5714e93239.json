However real life is always going to throw us curves.\n<P>\nA natural definition of a curved planar object is the <I>splinegon</I>,\na polygon bounded by algebraic curves, which can either be defined\nparametrically (x and y being polynomial functions of a parameter t) or\nimplicitly as the solution to a polynomial equation in x and y.\nEvery parametric curve can be represented implicitly but not vice versa;\nwhich form one uses depends on where the problem comes from.\nAn important measure of the complexity of these curves is the <I>degree</I>\nof the associated polynomials.\n<P>\nAnyway, the most basic data structure for straight-sided polygons\nis a <I>triangulation</I>, a partition of the polygon into three-sided regions\nusing the same vertices as the original polygon.\nMany other geometric algorithms are based on the existence of a triangulation.\nWhat similar thing should we use for splinegons?\n<P>\nObviously we can define triangulations in exactly the same way.\nUnfortunately, to triangulate splinegons we may need to increase the degree.\nAny diagonal in\nthe following splinegon quadrilateral, formed from four arcs of an ellipse,\nhas degree at least three.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"cusp.png\" WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=462 ALT=\"\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nMore generally, examples like this show that the degree of a diagonal\nmay be up to double the degree of the splinegon edges.\nHowever, we don't know whether it is always possible to triangulate\nsplinegons, even with high-degree diagonals.\n<P>\nIn the same four-cusp example, we can use four circular arcs instead of\na cubic spline diagonal, if we introduce an extra <I>Steiner point</I>\nin the middle of the splinegon.\n<P>\n<CENTER><IMG SRC=\"arcs.png\" WIDTH=462 HEIGHT=462 ALT=\"\"></CENTER>\n<P>\nIs it always possible to triangulate splinegons, using diagonals\nof degree matching the splinegon sides, and only introducting Steiner\npoints in the splinegon interior?  If so how many Steiner points are needed?\n\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
