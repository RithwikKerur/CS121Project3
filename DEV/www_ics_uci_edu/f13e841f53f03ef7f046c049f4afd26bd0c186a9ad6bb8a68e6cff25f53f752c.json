To our knowledge, this is the first peer-to-peer data structure\nthat simultaneously achieves high fault-tolerance, constant-sized nodes,\nand fast update and query times for ordered data. It is a non-trivial\nadaptation of the SkipNet/skip-graph structures of Harvey et al. and\nAspnes and Shah, so as to provide fault-tolerance as these structures do,\nbut to do so using constant-sized nodes, as in the family tree structure\nof Zatloukal and Harvey. It supports successor queries on a set of n items\nusing <I>O</I>(log <I>n</I>) messages with high probability, an improvement over the\nexpected <I>O</I>(log <I>n</I>) messages of the family tree.\n<p>\n(Joint work by Michael T.
