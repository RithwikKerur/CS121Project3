Early shuffle methods were motivated by the\nproblem of shuffling a deck of cards. An oblivious shuffle is a distributed\nshuffle executed by a client who permutes an array of encrypted data items\nstored at a server in such a way that the server cannot determine the output\npermutation with probability better than a random guess. Several private cloud\nstorage solutions that obfuscate the access pattern to the data use an\noblivious shuffle as a fundamental building block. We present the Melbourne\nShuffle, a simple and efficient oblivious shuffle that allows a client with\nO(\u221an) memory to obliviously shuffle  an array of size n stored at a server by\nexchanging O(\u221an) messages of size O(\u221an). The Melbourne Shuffle is the first\nprovably secure oblivious shuffle that is not based on sorting.\n\n<p>\nThis talk is based on the paper \u201cThe Melbourne Shuffle: Improving Oblivious\nStorage in the Cloud\u201d by Olga Ohrimenko, Michael Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia\nand Eli Upfal, International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming\n(ICALP), 2014 (to appear). \n\n<p>\n<b>Biography</b>: Roberto Tamassia is the Plastech Professor of Computer Science and\nthe Chair of the Department of Computer Science at Brown University. He is\nalso the Director of Brown's Center for Geometric Computing. His research\ninterests include data security and privacy, applied cryptography, analysis,\ndesign, and implementation of algorithms, graph drawing and computational\ngeometry. He is an AAAS Fellow, ACM Fellow, and IEEE Fellow, and the recipient\nof a Technical Achievement Award from the IEEE Computer Society for pioneering\nthe field of graph drawing.
