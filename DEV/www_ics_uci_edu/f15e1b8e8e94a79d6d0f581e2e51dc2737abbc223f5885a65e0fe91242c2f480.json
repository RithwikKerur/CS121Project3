Halldorsson in\n<i>Journal of Algorithms</i> 23, 265-280 (1987). The approximate\ncoloring algorithms in the paper work by forming a maximal partial\ncoloring with a limited number of colors. The remaining uncolored\nvertices are partitioned according to their adjacencies with\nmembers of one color class, forming a collection of subgraphs with\nsmaller chromatic number. These subgraphs are then colored\nindependently and recursively. Halldorsson shows that this approach\nleads to approximation ratios of\nO(<i>n</i>&nbsp;/&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>), not only sequentially\nbut also in the parallel and on-line settings.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
