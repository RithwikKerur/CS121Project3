Devanny\n</h2>\n\n<p>We study parallel comparison-based algorithms for finding all\nequivalence classes of a set of $n$ elements, where sorting according to\nsome total order is not possible. Such scenarios arise, for example, in\napplications, such as in distributed computer security, where each of $n$\nagents are working to identify the private group to which they belong,\nwith the only operation available to them being a zero-knowledge\npairwise comparison (sometimes called a &ldquo;secret\nhandshake&rdquo;) that reveals only whether two agents are in the same\ngroup or in different groups. We provide new parallel algorithms for\nthis problem, as well as new lower bounds and distribution-based\nanalysis.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Michael T.
