It took \nover\n a year to get off the ground, but the World Wide Web has expanded many\n times over since 1993. \n<p><A HREF=\"Questions\"><i>Return to list of questions.</i></a>\n<br>\n<li><A Name=\"Question2\"><H2>Is there a way to discuss upcoming \nperformances and other relevant info about theatre and film on the \nInternet?</H2></a>\n<br>\nAlthough one would think at first that drama has little to do with\n computing, there are indeed many places on the Web where one can \ndiscuss\n all aspects of theatre. For example, <a \nhref=\"http://www.mit.edu:8001/people/quijote/theatre-central.html\">\n<I>The Theatre Central Web Page<I></a> contains links to many other \ntheatre\n pages all around the world. As for information about upcoming events \nand\n exciting new techniques in the theatre industry, much can be discovered\n within the various <a href=\"http:www.mit.edu:8001/people/quijote/news\">\n drama newsgroups</a> which can be found on the Internet.\n<p><A HREF=\"Questions\"><i>Return to list of questions.</i></a>\n<br>\n<li><A Name=\"Question3\"><H2>Where can I begin my search for information \nwithin the World Wide Web?</H2></A>\n<br>\nAt over one million computers and growing, the Internet is the world's\n largest computer newtwork. Sifting through, and finding information on \nthe\n World Wide Web can be overwhelming, to say the least.  There are many\n places to start on a search for Web information, but I have found two\n particularly helpful ones to begin with. The first is called the <a \nhref=\"http://www.cs.colorado.edu/home/mcbryan/WWWW.html\">\n <I>World Wide Web Worm<I></a>. The Worm is located on the WWW server of \nthe University \n of Colorado homepage. Its function is to search throughout the Web for \nhome\n pages. The user enters in one or more keywords and the Worm takes over.\n Another great place to start searching is the <a \nhref=\"http://galaxy.einet.net/galaxy.html>\n<I>EINET Galaxy Index<I></a>. The Index contains information organized \nby\n topic. This is a much easier, but less specific searcher than the Worm.\n<p><A HREF=\"Questions\"><i>Return to list of questions.</i></a>\n<BR>\n<li><A Name=\"Question4\"><H2>What tools can I use to search for \ninformation on the Internet?</H2></A>\n<br>\nThere are two main tools to guide a user through the Internet: Gopher \nand\n the World Wide Web. Gopher provides a menu listing of subjects. When \none\n selects an item on a Gopher menu, another menu of related items is, \n in turn, displayed.  This proceedure is repeated until the user finds \nthe\n information he/she is looking for. The World Wide Web gives the user a \n graphical interface from which to make their selections, making it a \nmore\n user-friendly environment.      \n<br>\nSearch <a \nhref=\"http://galaxy.einet.net/gopher/gopher.html><i>Gopher<i></a>\nhere.\n<br>\nSearch the <a href=\"http://galaxy.einet.net/www/www.html><i>World Wide \nWeb<i></a>\nhere.\n<br>  \n<p><A HREF=\"Questions\"><i>Return to list of questions.</i></a>\n<BR>\n<li><A Name=\"Question3\"><H2>How can the World Wide Web benefit me as a \ndrama major?</h2></A>\n<br>\nThe World Wide Web has much to offer a drama student, whether it be \nthrough\n the online magazine <a \nhref=\"http://www.webcom.com/~broadway/welcome.html\">\n<I>Broadway World Wide<I></a>, or <a \nhref=\"http://www.ee.pdx.edu:80/depts/fpa/\">\n<i>Portland State University's<i> academic program. <I>Broadway World \nWide<I>\n offers theatre listings  for both Broadway and off-Broadway shows, a \nhelp\n wanted link which displays jobs currently available in the New York \ntheatre\n community, and also up to date news about the world of the stage.  All \nof\n these things benefit me by keeping me abreast of what is going on \ninside\n and outside of the university setting, enabling me to establish \ncontacts\n for my future career in theatre.  Portland University's site gives a \nguided\n tour through the college and its theatre program, including some facts \n \n about the state of Oregon. This is very helpful, as I am planning on \nmoving\n there in the near future. \n\n<p><A HREF=\"Questions\"><i>Return to list of questions.</i></a>\n\n</ol>\n\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n\n\n              \n", "encoding": "ascii"}
