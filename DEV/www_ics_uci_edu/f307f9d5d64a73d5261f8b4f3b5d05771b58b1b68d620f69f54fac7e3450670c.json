Don't spell your URLs this way, cuz\nthat syntax is reserved for version info\" is a no-no.\n\nWhat if somebody is already using the syntax ,xxx for\nsome other purpose? According to the URL standard, they're allowed\nto do that.\n\nStandardizing ,xxx for version info would be like standardizing .ps\nfor postscript resources. That's just not how it works. (the mapping\nof filename extension to media type is a per-server convention.  Folks\nwho exploit it on the client side do so on a heuristic basis, at their\nown peril)\n\n&gt;It does underscore the fact that attaching version information to URLs\n&gt;is going to be a battle, but a battle that I believe is well worth\n&gt;fighting.\n\nI assure you that Tim Berners-Lee and myself will do everything we\ncan to prevent you from winning.\n\nPlease see the original writing on the topic of versions in WWW:\n\n--------------\nHyperText Design Issues: Versioning\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/DesignIssues/Versioning.html\">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/DesignIssues/Versioning.html</a>\n\nA WWW server may provide versioning, by allowing links between a\ndocument version and its previou and succesive versions. This would be\na good use of link typing.\n\nKeeping track of versions allows one solution to the annotation problem.\n--------------\n\nand more recently:\n\nWeb Architecture: Generic Resources\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/DesignIssues/Generic\">http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/DesignIssues/Generic</a>\n\nThis is one of the few things that TimBL felt sufficiently strongly\nabout to take time out of his busy schedule and write about.\n\nIf you do not understand my objection, I suggest you study the\ndesign and architecture of WWW and URLs until you do.\n\n&gt;We need to stick to our guns: make a simple version extention to URLs\n&gt;and make them standard.\n\nI am confident that no such standard will be issued with the backing\nof W3C while Tim Berners-Lee is director.\n\nDaniel W.
