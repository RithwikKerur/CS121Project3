(I.e., what is the minimum spanning tree.)\nDraw this network.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: the minimum-cost network uses links connecting\nPortland-Seattle, SF-Seattle, LA-Seattle, and Anchorage-Portland.\nIts cost is\n$300&nbsp;+&nbsp;$500&nbsp;+&nbsp;$700&nbsp;+&nbsp;$1200&nbsp;=&nbsp;$2700.\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n\n<P>(b) Some types of network require the offices to be connected into a\nsingle loop (so the cheapest network is the same as the solution to the\ntraveling salesman problem).\nDoes there exist an algorithm for solving this problem?\nDraw the best such network you can find.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: yes, there exists an algorithm, for instance brute force search\n(trying all possible loops), but it is not efficient. \nIn this case there are 24 different loops\n(the general formula is that n cities would have (n-1)! loops).\n\n<P>I believe the shortest loop is Anchorage - Los Angeles - Seattle -\nPortland - San Francisco - Anchorage, with total cost $4300. \n\n<P>One way to see that this is best involves splitting the loop into\nthe part going into and out of Anchorage, and the remaining four-city path.\nLos Angeles - Seattle - Portland - San Francisco is the shortest\nfour-city path not involving Anchorage, so any better loop would have to\nimprove on the part of the tour going into and out of Anchorage.\nBut there are only two combinations of cities (San Francisco and\nPortland, or Los Angeles and Portland) for which the cost into and out\nof Anchorage is better, and neither combination gives a better overall loop.\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><LI>For each of the following functions,\nstate whether or not a program having the function as its running time\nwould be a polynomial-time program.\n\n<P>(a) time(n) = 4n<sup>3</sup> + 3n + 3\n<BR>(b) time(n) = 2n log n + 30n\n<BR>(c) time(n) = n<sup>1.5</sup>\n<BR>(d) time(n) = 2<sup>n</sup> log n\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer: Yes for a, b, and c; no for d.\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n<P><LI>For each of the following functions of a single parameter n,\nsimplify it as much as possible using O-notation.\nFor instance, if the function\nis 4n<sup>3</sup> + 3n + 3,\nyou should simplify it to O(n<sup>3</sup>).\n\n<P>(a) n + n<sup>2</sup>\n<BR>(b) 2<sup>n</sup> + n<sup>2</sup> + 2n + 2/n\n<BR>(c) (n+1)/(n-1)\n<BR>(d) 2<sup>n</sup> + 3<sup>n</sup> + 4<sup>n</sup> + 5<sup>n</sup>\n<BR>(e) n<sup>2</sup> + 100n + 10000\n\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=\"RED\"><I>\nAnswer:<BR>\n(a) O(n<sup>2</sup>)<BR>\n(b) O(2<sup>n</sup>)<BR>\n(c) O(1)<BR>\n(d) O(5<sup>n</sup>)<BR>\n(e) O(n<sup>2</sup>)\n</I></FONT></BLOCKQUOTE>\n\n</OL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
