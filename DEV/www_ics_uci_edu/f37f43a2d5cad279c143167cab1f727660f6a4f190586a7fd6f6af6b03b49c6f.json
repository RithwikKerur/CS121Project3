More precisely, we give two algorithms: the first\ncomputes a compressed quadtree for a planar point set, given the\nDelaunay triangulation; the second finds the Delaunay triangulation,\ngiven a compressed quadtree. Both algorithms run in deterministic linear\ntime on a pointer machine. Our work builds on and extends previous\nresults by Krznaric and Levcopolous and Buchin and Mulzer. Our main tool\nfor the second algorithm is the well-separated pair decomposition\n(WSPD), a structure that has been used previously to find Euclidean\nminimum spanning trees in higher dimensions. We show that knowing the\nWSPD (and a quadtree) suffices to compute a planar EMST in <i>linear</i>\ntime. With the EMST at hand, we can find the Delaunay triangulation in\nlinear time.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Wolfgang Mulzer, to appear at SODA 2011.)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
