If d(A,Q) (=distance from A to Q)\nand d(B,Q) are both integers, note that d(A,Q) - d(B,Q) is one of the\nintegers from -d(A,B) to d(A,B).  Now for any given k, the points Q\nwith d(A,Q) - d(B,Q) = k lie on a branch of a hyperbola (or its degenerate\ncases, a straight line parallel or perpendicular to AB).  Every point of\nyour set is an intersection of one of these curves, and one of the \nanalogous curves for A and C, and one of the curves for B and C.  But\nany two of the curves intersect in only a finite number of points.  \nTherefore there are only a finite number of points with integer distances\nfrom A, B and C.\n\n-- \nRobert Israel                            <A HREF=\"mailto:israel@math.ubc.ca\">israel@math.ubc.ca</A>\nDepartment of Mathematics             (604) 822-3629\nUniversity of British Columbia            fax 822-6074\nVancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Y4\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:israel@math.ubc.ca\">israel@math.ubc.ca</A> (Robert Israel)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        Re: Geometry problem (points on a plane)\n<B>Date:</B>           14 Jan 1996 08:43:27 GMT\n<B>Organization:</B>   Mathematics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn article &lt;4d62ik$7oo@geraldo.cc.utexas.edu&gt;,\nMiguel Lerma &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:mlerma@arthur.ma.utexas.edu\">mlerma@arthur.ma.utexas.edu</A>&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;Given a set S of points in a plane, we define property P(S) = \"the distance \n&gt;between any two points in S is a whole number, and there are no three \n&gt;distinct points of S in the same straight line\".\n\n&gt; A related problem is the \n&gt;following: a set S of points verifying property P will be called \n&gt;\"extendable\" if there is some point p not in S such that S union {p} \n&gt;verifies property P, otherwise it will be called \"non extendable\". \n&gt;By using Zorn's Lemma it is possible to prove that there is some \n&gt;(perhaps infinite) non extendable set S in the plane, so it makes \n&gt;sense to ask: which is the minimum cardinal of a non extendable set?\n\nThat's easy: 3.  Namely, the vertices of an equilateral triangle of\nside 1 form a non-extendable set.  \n\nProof: if A and B are two of the vertices, and Q any point with integer\ndistances from both but not collinear with them, then the absolute \nvalue of the difference between the distances AQ and BQ is less than 1,\nso must be 0.  The only point equidistant from all three vertices is\nthe centroid, but this is not an integer distance from them.\n\n-- \nRobert Israel                            <A HREF=\"mailto:israel@math.ubc.ca\">israel@math.ubc.ca</A>\nDepartment of Mathematics             (604) 822-3629\nUniversity of British Columbia            fax 822-6074\nVancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Y4\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>Date:</B>           Wed, 03 Apr 1996 13:49:09 +0100\n<B>From:</B>           solymosi &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:solymosi@ss10.nuik.kfki.hu\">solymosi@ss10.nuik.kfki.hu</A>&gt;\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ics.uci.edu\">eppstein@ics.uci.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        integral distances\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nIn 1945 P.Erdoes published the \"nice proof of Robert Israel\".
