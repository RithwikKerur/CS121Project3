Math.\nMonthly, 29 (1922), pp. 380-387?</p>\n\n<p>I don't think so, because Richard K. Guy in his book \"Unsolved\nProblems in Number Theory\", Springer 1994, pp. 162f., and even\nErd&ouml;s in his article \"Comment on problem E2427\", Amer. Math.\nMonthly, 81 (1974), pp. 780-782, not only cite Curtiss' article in\ntheir bibliography but also mention in their text explicitly him to\nhave proved the result.</p>\n\n<h2>Introduction to the subject</h2>\n\n<p>By Kellogg was the question raised, what the greatest\ndenominater in a representation of 1 as a sum of k unit-fractions\nof integers (1 = sum<sup>k</sup><sub>n=1</sub> 1/x<sub>n</sub>) is.\nHe conjectured for the maximum of the x<sub>n</sub>: x<sub>1</sub>\n= 1, x<sub>k+1</sub> = x<sub>k</sub> (x<sub>k</sub> + 1). This\nresult was \"proved\" by Curtiss.</p>\n\n<p>The mistake mentioned below is just concerning the proof and not\nthe theorems of Curtiss, because Takenouchi in his article \"On an\nIndeterminate Equation\", Proc. of the Physico-Mathematical Society\nof Japan, 3rd series, vol. 3, pp. 78-92, proved something similar.\nAlso Erd&ouml;s in his article mentioned above says that he has\nproved a generalization of the theorem in his Hungrian article \"On\na Diophantine Equation\", Mat. Lapok, 1 (1950), pp. 192-210.</p>\n\n<p>To prove the theorem by the methods introduced by Curtiss one\nneed (as I think and as I did) a lot more space than he did.</p>\n\n<h2>The \"proof\" of the mistake</h2>\n\n<p>To understand the following you have to have the original\narticle. I use \"g\" instead of \"\\varphi\".</p>\n\n<p>The mistake is on page 385. On page 384 he states the Theorem\nIII. To prove the theorem he starts with <b><i>any set</i></b>\nsatisfying equation (11) and \"shows\" that a transformation by his\nsecond method leads to a reduced set which also satisfies equation\n(11). This statement is wrong: Consider the set (3,3,4), which is\nobviously reduced. Thus the set (3,3) is satisfying equation (11).\nBy his second method he gains the set (2,6) which does not satisfy\nequation (11) for f<sub>n-2</sub>(x) = 3 &lt; 6!! (He should have\ntaken instead the set (2,4) for g<sub>n-2</sub>(3,3) = 36 &lt; 40 =\ng<sub>n-2</sub>(2,4)! Even if you consider the whole new set\n(2,4,6), it is impossible to prove what he \"did\" that\nX<sub>n-2</sub>/2 ( X<sub>n-2</sub>/2 + 1) &lt;=\nf<sub>n-2</sub>(x), for 4,6 &gt; 3 = f<sub>n-2</sub>(x)! Thus the\nreal problem on how to gain a new set satisfying equation (11) and\nincreasing g<sub>n-2</sub> from any set satisfying equation (11) is\nnot solved by Curtiss.)</p>\n\n<p>His mistake is in the line \"But since X is compact ...\". He has\n<b><i>two</i></b> sets X. The original set (x<sub>1</sub>, ...\nx<sub>n-1</sub>) was compact, but the shortened set (x<sub>1</sub>,\n... x<sub>n-2</sub>) is **not** always compact! This is the case\nwith the set (3,3,4) from above.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the Theorem III is not proven by Curtiss.</p>\n\n<p><i>Stefan Bartels</i></p>\n\n<hr>\n<pre>\n<b>From:</b>           <a href= \n\"mailto:stu30219@srv2.mail.uni-kiel.de\">stu30219@srv2.mail.uni-kiel.de</a> (Bartels)\n<b>Date:</b>           24 Oct 1996 15:06:25 GMT\n<b>Newsgroups:</b>     sci.math.research\n<b>Subject:</b>        Maximums of sums of Egyptian fractions\n</pre>\n\n<hr>\n<p>In the book</p>\n\n<blockquote>Paul Erd&ouml;s &amp; Ronald L.

This posting was submitted to this newsgroup by\nme in July. In the meantime I found out that the proof is\ndefinitely right (but obviously difficult to understand). (Sorry\nfor that.) But this mistake (of me) led to a generalization of\nCurtiss' theorem that has not been published elsewhere yet: The\nbest underapproximation of a rational <i>a/b</i> is given by the\ngreedy algorithm at least for the case <i>\nb</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;<i>a</i>. (In the case <i>\na</i>=<i>b</i>=1 this is Curtiss' theorem; in the case <i>a</i>=1\nthis is a statement proved by Erd&ouml;s in 1950.)</p>\n\n<p>I was also able to prove that the methods Curtiss invented work\nif and only if <i>b</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;-1&nbsp;mod&nbsp;<i>a</i>. But\nthere seem to be a lot more rationals for which the\nunderapproximation is given by the greedy algorithm. While trying\nto characterize these rationals I came across the theorem of\nErd&ouml;s and Graham, which I mentioned in my first posting on\nthis subject.</p>\n\n<p>Any hint on the proof of this theorem would be helpful.</p>\n\n<p><i>Stefan Bartels</i></p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
