Typically, such models consist of a population\nof\nseveral genotypes where each genotype reproduces at a different\nrate,\ngenotypes can mutate to each other, and the population is subject\nto the\nevolutionary pressure of selection. While such models have been\nused\nextensively to study different types of populations, recently,\nsuch\nstochastic finite population models have been used to model viral\npopulations with the goal of understanding the effect of mutagenic\ndrugs. Here, the time it takes for the population to reach a\nsteady\nstate is important both for carrying out simulations and to\ndetermine\ntreatment strength and duration. Despite their importance, and\nhaving\nbeen widely studied, there has been a lack of such bounds for many\nrelevant ranges of model parameters even for the case of two\ngenotypes\n(single locus); primarily due to their difficulty, see [Eth11].\nThe main result of this paper is an analytical bound on the mixing\ntime\nof a Wright-Fisher model for two genotypes when there is no\nrestriction\non the mutation rate or the fitness. Our bound explains (in this\nsetting) the observed phenomena that the mixing time is fast\n(logarithmic in the state space) for any fitness parameter when\nthe\nmutation rate is high enough. Theoretically, we overcome the\ndifficulty\nin proving mixing time bounds by showing that different forces are\nresponsible for the rapid mixing depending on how close it is to\nits\nsteady state. If the chain is sufficiently close to its stationary\ndistribution, an intricate coupling argument establishes rapid\nmixing.\nTo show that the chain reaches this state quickly, we connect it\nto the\nconvergence time of a deterministic model for evolution proposed\nby\nEigen. We are hopeful that our insights and techniques will be\nhelpful\nin establishing rigorous bounds for more general versions of this\nmodel.\n\n\n<p>\n  This paper is by Nisheeth K.
