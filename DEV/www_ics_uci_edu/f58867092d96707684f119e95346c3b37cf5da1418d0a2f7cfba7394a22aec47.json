Below\nis a list of items that should be included in your second deliverable.</P>\n\n<hr>\n<h3>Due Date</h3>\n<p>\nTBD.\n\n<hr>\n<h3>Requirements</h3>\n\n<P>This of course , is the full description of what you are going to do.\nYou've done these before, in ICS 52 and ICS 121, so you have plenty of\n&quot;model documents&quot; to draw from, to help you determine how to\nstructure this statement. Keep in mind that key objectives of a requirements\ndocument are:\n\n<ol>\n<li> Completeness -- everything is described\n<li> Understandability -- the &quot;customer&quot; can read it and be \nconvinced that all his objectives and needs are adequately and accurately \ndescribed\n<li> Utility -- the information in the document can be used effectively\nto help in the design phase (e.g. an OO requirements analysis can aid in\ndevelopment of an OO design)\n<li> No Ambiguity -- every reader will come away with the same understanding\n<li> Consistency -- No contradictions\n</ol>\n\n<P>\nUse diagrams of course, to help give appropriate overviews and understanding.\nNote that pictures may well be an essential element of the complete description\nof any graphical interface. \n</P>\n\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n\n<P>This section is reserved for any documentation you may have developed during\nthis phase of the project. Specifically, if during the course of developing\nthe your understanding of the various technologies involved in the porject,\nyou discovered items that were not documented, but which were important,\nthen you should include that here.</P>\n\n<P>Additionally you should list here the major sources of information that\nyou will be using during the remainder of the project.</P>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
