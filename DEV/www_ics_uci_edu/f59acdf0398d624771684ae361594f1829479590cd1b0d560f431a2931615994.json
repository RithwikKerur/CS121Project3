Project reports are due in my\nmailbox in CS 448, by 5:00PM on Thursday, March 11.  Project\ndemonstrations will be held in the ICS labs on the third floor of the CS\nbuilding, at a date and time to be announced (likely during the\nscheduled final exam time).\n\n<P>Each project report should include the following information.\n\n<OL>\n<LI><B>Title</B>, authors, student ids, course information, and date.\n\n<P><LI><B>Introduction</B>. What game does your project play?\nBriefly describe the rules and history of the game.\nAre there different variations on the rules, and if so how did you chose \nwhich variation to implement?\nDo you know of other programs for this game, written elsewhere?\nWhat machine or machines does your program run on?\n\n<P><LI><B>User interface</B>.  How would a user go about playing a game \nagainst your program?  Include screen shots.\n\n<P><LI><B>Search</B>.  If you use anything other than vanilla alpha-beta \nsearch, describe it and explain why you needed it.\nWhat is the <I>branching factor</I> of your game (average or typical number of \ndifferent moves available in any given position)?\nHow does this differ from the <I>effective branching factor</I> of your \nprogram (average or typical number of moves that it searches from a \nposition before pruning stops the search)?\n(Note, you can compute the effective branching factor by the formula \nb=x<sup>1/d</sup> where x is the total number of nodes searched and d is \nthe search depth.)  Does your program always \nsearch to the same fixed depth, or does it use a timer to control the \ndepth it searches?  How many levels deep does it typically search?\nWhat is the total number of game positions a typical search evaluates, and \nhow many evaluations per second does it perform (on whatever machine you're \nrunning it on; state how fast a machine this is).\n\n<P><LI><B>Search improvements</B>.  Are you using hashing, or any search \nextensions or \"extra\" pruning (pruning above and beyond the normal pruning \nperformed by the alpha-beta algorithm)?  If so, describe them and if \npossible say something about how much they helped improve your program's \nperformance.\n\n<P><LI><B>Evaluation function</B>.  Explain in English the terms that go \nin to your evaluation function.  Were you able to update these terms \nincrementally as moves were generated, or did you have to recompute them \nfrom scratch each time you evaluated a new position?  Did you try any \nother terms that turned out not to be useful? What evaluation \nterms would you add to further improve your program's performance if you \nhad the time to add more terms?\n\n<P><LI><B>Experiences</B>. What was your most interesting bug?\nWhich parts of the program did you find took you the most time to write?\nWhich parts did you find the most confusing?\nWhat would you do differently if you were to start the same project from \nscratch?\n\n<P><LI><B>Performance</B>. How well does your program play the game?\nDoes it beat you sometimes/always/never?\nInclude the complete moves to two games you or others have played against \nthe machine, one in which you move first and one in which the machine moves \nfirst.  Explain any of the machine's moves that you think deserves \nexplanation \n(either because you think it's a mistake, or because it's a very good and \nnon-obvious move).\n\n<P><LI><B>Source code</B>. Include a complete listing of all sources for \nyour program.\n</OL>\n\n<HR>\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/\">David Eppstein,\n<A HREF=\"/\">Dept.
