We will start formally\nchecking this no later than 23 January.  Our main focus the week of\n17-20 January will be helping people with these tasks, but if time\nin Labs allows, we may be able to start formal checking of mastery\ntoward the end of this week.\n\n<P>A copy of these instructions is being mailed to you.\nYou will also be given a printed copy in lab.\n\n<P>After setting up your ea.oac.uci.edu login as described in the next\nparagraph, \"Export\" a copy of what has been mailed to you from the\ne-mail system to a file named \"Lab.1\" in the special \"ics.1c\"\ndirectory created by following these instructions.  (This means\nthat the name of the file when viewed from your home directory will be\n\"ics.1c/Lab.1\")  As you work through the Lab Exercises described below,\nupdate this file with your own notes about doing things.\n\n<P>Set up your ea.oac.uci.edu login for the ICS 1C class by getting to the\n\"ea>\" prompt (quit the EA-menu system if you are in it) and typing\n<PRE>\n    source ~ics1c/class.setup\n</PRE>\nThis will create a directory (\"folder\" in Mac-speak) named \"ics.1c\"\nin your home/login directory and set some configuration files.\nNow follow the instructions given on the screen about the\nWindow Manager Configuration:\n\n<UL>\n  <LI>You will get the new ICS 1C setup automatically next time you log in.\n  This one time only, though, to switch to\n  the new ICS 1C Window Manager Configuration:\n    <UL>\n    <LI>Position the mouse on the background screen.\n      Holding down the right button, drag the mouse down the\n      right half of the menu until you come to \"TWM Operations,\" and\n      then select \"Source .twmrc\" from the menu that appears.\n    </UL>\n</UL>\n\n<HR>\n\n<H1>Basic EA skills you need:</H1>\n\n<DL>\n  <DT><B>EA-Menu system:</B>\n    <DD>Be able to exit the EA menu system and get to the \"ea>\" prompt\n    and to restart it (by typing \"menu\" at the \"ea>\" prompt.\n\n  <DT><B>E-mail (pine recommended):</B>\n    <DD>\n    <UL>\n      <LI>Read, reply to, forward, and refile e-mail messages you receive.\n      <LI>\"Export\" an e-mail message you receive to the file system.\n      <LI>Compose and send new e-mail messages.\n      <LI>Include in an e-mail message you send the contents of a file\n        read in from the file system.\n      <LI>Create and update an e-mail \"address book\" of the names an\n        e-mail addresses of those with whom you are likely to correspond\n        (e.g., members of your ICS 1C team).\n    </UL>\n\n  <DT><B>File and directory creation, manipulation and editing:</B>\n    <DD>\n    <UL>\n      <LI>Directory operations: \n      <UL>\n        <LI>mkdir (make a directory)\n        <LI>cd (change current/default/working directory)\n        <LI>pwd (print current/default/working directory)\n        <LI>ls (list a directory), ls -l (list long/detailed version),\n\t  ls -a (list all files, including ones normally hidden, ls -al\n      </UL>\n      <LI>File operations:\n      <UL>\n        <LI>ls (as above, for directories), mv (move/rename), cp (copy)\n        <LI>create and edit -- pico is the recommended editor for beginners\n      </UL>\n    </UL>\n\n  <DT><B>X Window System:</B>\n    <DD>\n    <UL>\n      <LI>3-button mouse operation and the options that appear when the mouse\n        is positioned on the background screen (\"root window\") and each\n        is pressed.\n      <LI>Moving, iconifying, resizing, bringing forward, etc. windows\n      <LI>Changing the font size in a normal shell/text window \n        (crtl/right-button)\n      <LI>Cutting and pasting text between windows.\n\t<UL>\n         <LI>(Hold down left button and drag to cut.

You can left-click the mouse\n    or use the arrows to reposition the cursor, but (BEWARE) the Delete\n    key on the keyboard deletes to the RIGHT of where the cursor is within\n    the window.  So to edit strings in type-in windows, one typically\n    MUST use a left-button click or arrow keys to position the cursor\n    to the LEFT of where the deletion/insertion is to be made.)\n</DL>\n\n<HR>\n<i>This information brought to you by\n<A HREF=\"/\">www.ics.uci.edu</A><br> Current as of\n23 January 1995\n<br>\nPlease send comments to ics1c@ics.uci.edu,\nincluding the URL to which your comments apply.\n</i>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
