Josephson </strong></p>\n\n<p><em></em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>A slightly shortened version of this article was published\nin the Times Higher Education Supplement's special section on\nConsciousness linked to the Tucson II conference &quot;Toward a\nScience of Consciousness&quot;, Apr. 5th. 1996, page (v). </em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Those who recognise that significant discoveries in science\nare very often prompted by observations that do not fit\nexpectations will find a stimulating challenge in accumulating\nevidence that it is possible to elicit psychic functioning in\nexperiments with ordinary volunteers acting as subjects. Even\nmore convincing results occur with specially selected subjects. </p>\n\n<p>In one type of experiment, a &quot;target&quot; photograph or\nvideo segment is randomly chosen out of a set of four\npossibilities. A &quot;sender&quot; attempts to transmit it\nmentally and a &quot;receiver&quot; is then asked to provide an\naccount either verbally or in writing of what she imagines it\nmight be. She is then shown the four possibilities, and selects\nthe one she thinks best matches her perception. By chance alone,\na correct match is expected on average one time in four, whereas\nthe experiments typically show the considerably higher success\nrate of around one in three. </p>\n\n<p>The recent declassification of the US government's psychical\nresearch programme (experiments on &quot;remote viewing&quot;,\nsimilar to the type just described except that it used\nindependent judges to assess the matches rather than having the\nsubjects judge themselves) has permitted a comparison to be made\nof the results of this programme with those described in the open\nliterature. Despite the different judging procedure, similar\nsuccess rates were found. In addition, many of the governmental\nexperiments used gifted subjects. The success rate was then even\nhigher, typically over forty percent. The few experiments in the\nopen literature that used gifted subjects found similar success\nrates. </p>\n\n<p>In the past, critics have attempted to discredit positive\nresults in psychical research on grounds of lack of\nrepeatability. But, as anyone with a training in statistics\nknows, even where an influence exists, an isolated experiment\nwith an insufficient number of trials may not demonstrate a\nstatistically significant effect. Accordingly, without a more\nsophisticated analysis, &quot;failure to reproduce an\neffect&quot; does not demonstrate its absence. Suppose, for\nexample, psychic abilities, in line with the results already\ndescribed, increase the chances of a successful match from 1/4 to\n1/3. Then (according to the accepted statistical theories), an\nexperiment with 30 trials, which has been typical of these\nexperiments, would have less than a 17% chance of achieving a\nresult of statistical significance. The more recent larger\nexperiments still utilise only about 100 trials, and have only\nabout a 57% chance of achieving statistical significance. </p>\n\n<p>Detailed analysis of the complete collection of experiments on\nthis type of phenomenon shows that what holds, despite changes in\nequipment, experimenter, subjects, judges, targets and\nlaboratories, is far greater consistency with the 1 in 3 success\nrate already mentioned than with the 1 in 4 chance expectation\nrate. Such consistency is the hallmark of a genuine effect, and\nthis, together with the very low probability of the overall\nsuccess rate observed occurring by chance, argues strongly for\nthe phenomena being real and not artifactual. </p>\n\n<p>Reexamination of other types of psychical investigations\nreveals that they too achieved replicable effects, which went\nlargely unappreciated because of a poor understanding of\nstatistics. For instance, an analysis of experiments in\nprecognitive card guessing and related &quot;forced-choice&quot;\nexperiments, published by Honorton and Ferrari in the <em>Journal\nof Parapsychology</em>, found that gifted subjects were able to\nachieve consistently about a 27% success rate when 25% was\nexpected by chance. Similar U.S. government experiments have been\nrevealed to have achieved the same 27% success rate over\nthousands of trials. If chance alone were the explanation for\nthese results, it would be truly remarkable to achieve a 27%\nsuccess rate over thousands of trials, and it would be even more\nremarkable to see identical results in the government work. For\nfurther details about the recent evidence, including both a\nfavourable and a skeptical assessment of the U.S. government\nexperiments, consult the <em>Journal of Scientific Exploration</em>,\nVol. 10(1), or <a href=\"http://www-stat.ucdavis.edu/users/utts/\">http://www-stat.ucdavis.edu/users/utts/</a>\non the Internet. </p>\n\n<p>Strong statistical results are of course meaningless if\nexperiments are not properly conducted. Debunkers of\nparapsychology are fond of showcasing the very few experiments\nthat have been found to have serious problems. But that ignores\nthe fact that the vast majority of experiments were done using\nexcellent protocols, paying close attention to potential subtle\ncues, using well-tested randomisation devices and so on. For the\npast decade the U.S. government experiments were overseen by a\nvery high-level scientific committee, consisting of respected\nacademics from a variety of disciplines, all of whom were\nrequired to critique and approve the protocols in advance. There\nhave been no explanations forthcoming that allow an honest\nobserver to dismiss the growing collection of consistent results.\n</p>\n\n<p>What are the implications for science of the fact that psychic\nfunctioning appears to be a real effect? These phenomena seem\nmysterious, but no more mysterious perhaps than strange phenomena\nof the past which science has now happily incorporated within its\nscope. What ideas might be relevant in the context of suitably\nextending science to take these phenomena into account? Two such\nconcepts are those of the observer, and non-locality. The\nobserver forces his way into modern science because the equations\nof quantum physics, if taken literally, imply a universe that is\nconstantly splitting into separate branches, only one of which\ncorresponds to our perceived reality. A process of\n&quot;decoherence&quot; has been invoked to stop two branches\ninterfering with each other, but this still does not answer the\nquestion of why our experience is of one particular branch and\nnot any other. Perhaps, despite the unpopularity of the idea, the\nexperiencers of the reality are also the selectors. </p>\n\n<p>This idea perhaps makes sense in the light of theories that\npresuppose that quantum theory is not the ultimate theory of\nnature, but involves (in ways that in some versions of the idea\ncan be made mathematically precise) the manifestations of a\ndeeper &quot;subquantum domain&quot;. In just the same way that a\nsurf rider can make use of random waves to travel effortlessly\nalong, a psychic may be able to direct random energy at the\nsubquantum level for her own purposes. Some accounts of the\nsubquantum level involve action at a distance, which fits in well\nwith some purported psychic abilities. </p>\n\n<p>These proposals are extremely speculative. What needs to be\ndone, in any event, is to integrate mental phenomena more\nthoroughly into the framework of science (including the quantum\nlevel) than is presently the case. The research of Lawrence\nLeShan (as described in his book <em>The Medium, the Mystic and\nthe Physicist</em>), where interviews with psychics disclosed\nthat they were aware of a &quot;hierarchy of meaningful\ninterconnections&quot;, perhaps provides a hint of what might be\ninvolved. Science has a poor handle on ideas such as meaningful\ninterconnections since they are alien to its usual ways of\nthinking. Perhaps it will need to overcome its current abhorrence\nof such concepts in order to arrive at the truth. </p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">* * * * * * * * * * </p>\n\n<p>Jessica Utts is professor of statistics, University of\nCalifornia, Davis, and was one of two experts commissioned by the\nCIA to review the two-decade U.S. government psychic research\nprogramme in the Summer of 1995.
