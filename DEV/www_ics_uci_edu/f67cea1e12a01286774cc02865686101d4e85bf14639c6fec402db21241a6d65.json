His father was Itzhak David. His father was Shmuel. \r\n\r\nThe second question is does anybody know more about Shmuel? His parents? Siblings? \r\nOther children?

As a \r\nlittle boy, I remember visiting his shop where he lived in the back. We \r\ncalled his \"Zaida.\" He moved to Long Beach, NY with Grandma and Grandpa \r\nLangsam in the early 1950's and lived in our house at 129 East Walnut Street \r\nuntil his death. I must have been about 10 or 11 when he died because I \r\nstayed with my Uncle Max and Aunt Helen that summer while he was failing. I \r\nremember him helping Grandpa (who was severely injured in a robbery of his \r\ndry goods store in the Bronx) walk to shul in Long Beach from our house. I \r\nbelieve he is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Lodi, NJ where Aaron Langsam \r\nand Sarah Langsam are also buried on the grounds of the Sons of the Galician \r\nZionists, the shul and fraternal group in the Bronx where they davened.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the Langsam-Spira genealogy?
