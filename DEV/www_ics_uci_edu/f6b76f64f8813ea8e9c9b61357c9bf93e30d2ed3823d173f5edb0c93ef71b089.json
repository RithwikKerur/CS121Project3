We have used GNU C++ to compile\r\nin the provided makefile, but other C++ compilers should work.  The\r\nresulting executable program is \"perftest\", currently as a\r\ndemonstration program it is hard-coded to look for specific reference\r\ngenome, reference SNP map, and genome to be compressed.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nTo run the code, you will need the following two datasets:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The human reference genome\r\n(<a href=chr.tgz>hg18</a>, 840MB).\r\nThis is the exact same data from UCSC\r\n<a href=\"http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/chromosomes/\">goldenPath</a>,\r\nyou will likely achieve faster download directly from UCSC.  There are\r\n25 FASTA files, one for each chromosome and the mitochondrial genome\r\n(which typically isn't used), that should be uncompressed and placed\r\nin a \"chr\" subdirectory under the source code.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li><a href=dbSNP.tgz>dbSNP\r\ndatabase</a>, 140MB, used as the refernece SNP map.  The SNP data is\r\nbased upon NCBI dbSNP build 129, but we use the UCSC SNP track as it\r\nhas pre-processed all of the needed data into a single table. The UCSC\r\n<a href=\"http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables\">Table Browser</a>\r\ncan be used to acquire the SNPs (group: Variation and Repeats, track:\r\nSNPs (129), table: snp129). There are 25 FASTA files, one for each\r\nchromosome and the mitochondrial genome. These should be in a \"dbSNP\"\r\nsubdirectory under the source code.\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<li>James Watson's\r\n<a href=JWB.tgz>genome</a>,\r\n418M, used as the example genome to be compressed.  The data is from\r\nthe Nature\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v452/n7189/full/nature06884.html\">\r\npublication</a> and was kindly provided by David Wheeler. There are\r\ntwo files, one which lists all of the indels (JWB-indels-submission)\r\nand the other which lists the SNPs (JWB-snps-submission.txt). These\r\nshould be in a \"files\" subdirectory under the source code.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\nAll files generated by the \"perftest\" executable will be created in\r\nthe \"files\" subdiretory.  The program compresses the genome then\r\nuncompresses it.  The following files will be created:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>JWB-unified-file.txt: Post-processing of the variation data for JW\r\ngenome into a more compact text representation; this removes the\r\nunneeded fields from the data set.  This data is the basis for\r\ncompression and is ~84MB for JW genome.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>JWB-in-posFreq4.txt: The 4-mer frequency table for JW genome.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>JWB-unified-compression.txt: This is the resulting compressed\r\ngenome, it should ~4MB for JW genome.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>JWB-unified-DeCompression.txt: This is the resulting decompressed\r\ngenome, it should be equivalent to the original file\r\n(JWB-unified-file.txt).\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Future work</h3>\r\n\r\nWe have plans to enhance the code into a more flexible genome\r\ncompression library.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nAny questions about use of this code should be directed\r\nto <a href=\"mailto:xhx@ics.uci.edu\">Xiaohui Xie</a>\r\nor <a href=\"mailto:chenli@ics.uci.edu\">Chen Li</a>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>For citation, please refer to the following paper</h3>\r\n<a href=\"http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/2/274\">Human genomes as email attachments</a>, Christley S, Lu Y, Li C, and Xie X, Bioinformatics. 2009 25:274-5.
