It is the foundation upon which most commercial activity (and much non-commercial activity) takes place in the \"real world,\" and it will surely play a significant role in determining the shape of \"e-commerce\" in the coming years. Needless to say, this is not the forum for an extensive discussion of the many subtleties of contract doctrine.  Our focus here is on a small slice of contract doctrine: do interactions on the global electronic network pose any special contract problems, or require any change in the way we ordinarily think about contractual relationships?<P>\r\n Like many complicated subjects, contract law has a simple set of principles at its foundation.  Contracts are fundamentally *voluntary* exchanges, and contract law looks for evidence that the parties have MUTUALLY ASSENTED to the terms of a particular set of obligations before it will impose those obligations on them.  Anglo-American law has stylized this idea as follows:  before the law will recognize the existence of a binding contract, there must be\r\n<blockquote>    \r\n<TABLE>\r\n<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>\r\n<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=\"1\">1.</td><td>A definite OFFER by one party (called the \"offeror\"),  and<BR>\r\n<tr><td>2.</td><td>A timely ACCEPTANCE (by the \"offeree\").</TD>\r\n</TR>\r\n</TABLE></blockquote>\r\n<P>\r\n Thus, if one party makes an offer -- \"Pay me $500 and I will paint your living room\" -- and another party accepts the offer -- \"OK, that sounds like a good deal, go ahead and I'll pay you when you're done\" -- the law infers that the parties have voluntarily agreed to be bound to the set of mutual obligations.<P>\r\nIn addition, there is another pre-requisite:\r\n<blockquote>    \r\n<TABLE>\r\n<TR ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>\r\n<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP COLSPAN=\"1\">3.</td><td>Some CONSIDERATION must pass between the offeree and the offeror.</TD></TR>\r\n</TABLE></blockquote><P>\r\n This needs a bit of explaining.  Suppose you meet someone at a party (call her Alice), and during the conversation you discover that a few months ago she began work as a computer consultant.  \"That's funny,\" you say, \"My firm is looking for a consultant to help out with a new system we're installing. First thing tomorrow, I'm going to call our MIS Director and tell him to get in touch with you.\"  Alice replies \"That would be terrific - thanks so much for your help.\" Unfortunately, you completely forget to make the call.  Have you \"breached your contract\"?<P>\r\nThe answer is no -- your promise to Alice is not enforceable as a binding contract.  Not because you didn't make an offer (to call the MIS Director), or that Alice didn't accept it. And it's not because your promise was not in writing; as we'll see, the legal system is prepared to enforce all sorts of contracts merely on the basis of an oral understanding. The reason this is unenforceable is that there was no *exchange* between you, no quid pro quo; Alice didn't give *you* anything of value in exchange for your promise. Without that -- without what the law calls \"consideration\" for your promise -- your promise is not enforceable in court.<P>\r\n With this basic framework in hand, let's look, in the next few messages, at common contract problems that are likely to crop up on the Net.<P>\r\n\r\n<P>authors:\r\n<TABLE CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>\r\n<TR><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Larry Lessig</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>David Post</TD><TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Eugene Volokh</TD></TR>\r\n</TABLE>\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n<BR>\r\n<CENTER>\r\n<HR SIZE=\"3\" WIDTH=\"65%\">\r\n\r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"../csl_lessons.html\">Back to Lesson Index</A>\r\n</CENTER>\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"><font size=\"2\">\r\nCopyright \u00a9 1999 Social Science Electronic Publishing, Inc.
