Can anybody exhibit a colouring\n&gt; which demonstrates that 4 colours suffice to have no two points on the\n&gt; plane at a distance of 1 inch? Or prove that 4 colours do not suffice? \n&gt; Anybody know of any references? \n&gt; \n&gt;  Vijay Raghavan\n&gt; \n\nThis is indeed a long standing problem. Usually stated as follows: Let G\nbe the graph with vertices the points of the plane and two points joined\nif they are at distance one from each other. Then the question is: What\nis the chromatic number of this graph?? (the smallest number of colours\nwith which the vertices can be coloured so that adjacent vertices have\ndifferent colours). This is one of Paul Erdos' pet problems and I have\nheard him speak on it a couple of times. The known results (from memory\nand now at least a couple of years old) are\n\n(1) The graph can be 7-coloured  (try a hexagonal tessellation)\n(2) There is a configuration that requires 4 colours (the one demanded\nby the Putnam problem will do)\n\nThus, if chi is the chromatic number then  4 <U>&lt;</U> chi <U>&lt;</U> 7.\n\nOther than that the true number could be anywhere... A typical combinatorial\npuzzler - easy to state, impossible to prove. \n\nA further result due to Erdos is that if this graph requires k colours, then\nsome FINITE subgraph of it also requires k colours. However there is no\nimmediate reason to believe that if there IS a configuration that requires\n5 colours then it is on less than &lt;billions&gt; of vertices  (substitute your\nown large number).\n\nSimilar problems have also been studied for the integer line (where you\njoin two integers if they differ by an amount in some fixed set - say\n{1,2,5} or whatever). \n\nThis is all from memory and I have no references, so anyone with more\nup-to-date info please feel free to correct me...\n\nGordon\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>From:</B>           <A HREF=\"mailto:ilan@Gang-of-Four.Stanford.EDU\">ilan@Gang-of-Four.Stanford.EDU</A> (Ilan Vardi)\n<B>Newsgroups:</B>     sci.math\n<B>Subject:</B>        References for Putnam problem A-4 (chromatic number)\n<B>Date:</B>           12 Jan 89 00:46:24 GMT\n<B>Reply-To:</B>       <A HREF=\"mailto:ilan@Gang-of-Four.Stanford.EDU\">ilan@Gang-of-Four.Stanford.EDU</A> (Ilan Vardi)\n<B>Organization:</B>   Computer Science Department, Stanford University\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nHere is a pretty good list of references for the chromatic number of\nthe plane (i.e., how many colors do you need so that no two points 1\naway are the same color) up to around 1982 (though the publication\ndates are up to 1985). This asks for the chromatic number of the graph\nwhere two points in R^2 are connected if they are distance 1 apart.\nLet this chromatic number be chi(2) and in general let chi(n) be the\nchromatic number of R^n. By a theorem in [2] this is equivalent to\nfinding what the maximum chromatic number of a finite subgraph of this\ninfinite graph is.\n\n[1]  H.
