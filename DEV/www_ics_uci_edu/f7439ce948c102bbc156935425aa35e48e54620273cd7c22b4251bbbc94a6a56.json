Yet few people have much understanding of &quot;how language works&quot; or of the basic principles of language that linguists have discovered, and even the linguists have a lot still to figure out (which is why you can't trust the green lines in Microsoft Word). Learning some of this can help you in areas ranging from child-rearing to persuasive writing to effective communication with diverse people. (That's the &quot;profit&quot; in the title; we won't explicitly address making actual cash from one's knowledge of language.)</P>\n<p>This course is also a Freshman Seminar, so it has the additional goal of letting you interact at a human scale with a faculty member, to see how we work and how we think. That makes it appropriate that we spend a bit of time talking more broadly about the university, why it's here, how it works, and how to get the most from your time here. You should feel free to bring up issues like this any time.</P>\n<P>\n  <B>Meeting place and times:</B>  Class meets\nThursdays from 1:00 to 1:50 in Humanities Hall 232, with no meeting on March 3.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Office hours:</B>  You are welcome to drop by my office at any time. If I'm there and not immersed in something else, I'll be glad to chat about the course or other topics. I will definitely be in or near\nmy office on Tuesdays at 11:00 and Thursdays at at 9:30, <!--during these scheduled hours,--> when course-related matters\nwill have first priority. <!--:  Tuesdays from 12:30 to 1:15 and Wednesdays from 11:30 to 12:20 and Fridays from 2:15 to 2:45.-->  Of course emergencies may come\nup, but I will try to give advance notice of any change.  I&#39;ll also be\nhappy to make arrangements for other times during the week; &quot;making an appointment&quot; is no big deal (but if you make one, don't skip it without getting in touch).  The quickest\nand most effective way to reach me is by electronic mail.</P>\n<P>\n<B>Questions and announcements:</B>  <FONT >You can\n get a response to your course-related questions most quickly by posting them at Piazza.com (see below). </FONT><FONT > If you\nneed to reach me privately, send electronic mail to <code><a href=\"mailto:kay@uci.edu\">kay@uci.edu</a></code>.  I will never intentionally ignore a message, so if you don't receive a response, write again; sometimes overactive spam filters snag a legitmate message. Using course-specific subject lines and your UCInet Email address will help your messages get noticed.</FONT></P>\n<P>\nI will also send course announcements by Email\nto the official course mailing list, so you should check your Email regularly.\n Note that this mailing list goes to the Email address that the registrar\nhas for you (your UCInet ID).  If you prefer to read your Email on another\naccount, you should set your UCInet account to forward your Email to your\npreferred account (see how in the Advice section below). Don&#39;t let this slide, in this class or any class; if you miss official announcements, your grade\ncould suffer.  </P>\n<p>\nThis course has a home page at <code><A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/us3/w14.html\">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/courses/us3/</A></code>; there's an archive of official course Email at <code><a href=http://e3.uci.edu/16w/w3m3/87569\">http://e3.uci.edu/16w/w3m3/87569</a></code>.</p>\n<P>\n<B>Readings and course materials:</B> Our main reference is the <em>Linguistics Wikibook</em> at\n<a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linguistics\"><code>http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linguistics</code></a>.  We will assign readings each week, along with exercises or assignments.</P>\n<P>\n  <B>Course structure:</B>\nYour course grade will be determined 50% from participation\u2014showing up every Tuesday and being engaged with the topic\u2014and 50% from the assigned written exercises.   If you anticipate missing a class, please get in touch with me. There will be no exams. Since this is a one-unit course, you should expect to devote to it approximately 25% of the time and effort you'd devote to a standard four-unit course.</P>\n<P>\n  We&#39;re required to say that in unusual\n  circumstances, these criteria could change, but we do not expect that to\nhappen.</P>\n<P><B>Special needs:</B> Any student who feels he or she may need an accommodation due to a disability should contact the UCI Disability Services Center at (949) 824-7494 as soon as possible to explore the possible range of accommodations. We encourage all students having difficulty, whether or not due to a disability, to consult privately with the instructor at any time.</P>\n<P>\n<B>What you must do right now to get started\nin US 3<BR />\n</B>&mdash; If you do not have a UCInet ID,\nget one.
