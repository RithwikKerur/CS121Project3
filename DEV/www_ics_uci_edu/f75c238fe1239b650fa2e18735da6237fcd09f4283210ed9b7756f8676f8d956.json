This line of work was initiated by P&#259;tra&#351;cu (STOC 2010) who\nreduced 3SUM to an offline SetDisjointness problem. However, the\nreduction introduced by P&#259;tra&#351;cu suffers from several inefficiencies,\nmaking it difficult to obtain tight conditional lower bounds from the\n3SUM conjecture.</p>\n\n<p>In this talk I'll discuss the deficiencies of P&#259;tra&#351;cu's framework,\nthen give new and efficient reductions from 3SUM to offline\nSetDisjointness and offline SetIntersection (the reporting version of\nSetDisjointness) which leads to polynomially higher lower bounds on\nseveral problems.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.6756\">Joint work</a> with Seth\nPettie and Ely Porat\n<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611974331.ch89\">from SODA\n2016</a>.)\n\n<p><i>About the speaker:</i></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~tsvi/\">Tsvi Kopelowitz</a> is a\npostdoctoral fellow in the Department of Electrical Engineering and\nComputer Science at the University of Michigan.
