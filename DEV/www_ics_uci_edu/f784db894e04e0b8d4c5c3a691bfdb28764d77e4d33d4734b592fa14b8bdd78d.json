It was adopted for this purpose as an \ninternational standard, by the name ISO 8879. Its underlying goal is to \nfacilitate efficient distribution and retrieval of information in a \ngeneralized language that will not mandate a specific appearance or \ninterpretation by the client. The SGML standard actually defines the \nmarkup language used in creating and disseminating hypertext documents \nin Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML. HTML defines the \n<A HREF= \"http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html\">structure of \na hypertext document</A> such that any client can interpret it according to \nits program's capabilities. Thus, HTML takes the basic philosophy of \ngenerating a flexible markup language and applies it to hypertext and \nmultimedia systems such as the World Wide Web.<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ3\"><B>How can I find out about graduate schools in my major, and especially how can I get more information on the University of Washington?</B></A>\nThere is a fairly comprehensive list of \n<A HREF= \"http://www.clas.ufl.edu/CLAS/american-universities.html\">American \nUniversities</A> available \non the World Wide Web which is put out by Mike Conlon at the University \nof Florida. Each link is a name of an American University and takes you \nto that schools home page, or occassionally to a departmental home \npage. For an even more comprehensive and extensive list of worldwide \nUniversity links, there is a fine list of international universities \nwhich comes from MIT. Both of these pages will attempt to provide \nthe viewer with a link that will provide access to other departments \nand resources at the university you choose. For example, the \n<A HREF= \"http://www.cac.washington.edu:1180/\">University \nof Washington's</A> home page is exquisitevely laid out and gives \nreferences to its various schools, departments, and sponsored \nactivities.<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><B>Where can I get more some inside information on \nStephen Franklin and get access to his vast informational resources on the \nWeb, thus aiding my education in this class tenfold?</B></A>\nOne can get access to the world renowned and illustrious mentor of the \n\"many\" through the department which is simply too small to contain his \never abounding informational capacity. Namely, one can click onto \n<A HREF= \"http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/\">Franklin's home page</A> \nhere which comes from the Office of Academic \nComputing at the University of California Irvine. If one wants to \nbypass his home page, which I certainly do not suggest given his \ngrinning mug will greet you there, one can link directly onto \n<A HREF= \"http://www.oac.uci.edu/indiv/franklin/hotlist.html\">his \nown personal hotlist</A>. Here you will find an extensive and highly useful \narray of the resources and Web documents that made our hero everything \nthat he is.  By accessing this vast repetoire of greatness, we may be \nable to take over his ICS 1C class by exhibiting our own superior expertise \nand knowledge of the World Wide Web.

Extropianism is actually more of a mindset rather \nthan a platform of concrete and hard held ideas. They are most interested \nin exploration of life and its many facets with a particular emphasis on \ntechnology as a means of bridging political and social differences. \nExtropians, ultimately then, or perpetual and self sustained optimistic \nexplorers who tend not to hold any particular allegiances while \nadvocating infinite creativity and total and boundless expansion. This is \nnot to say there are no \n<A HREF= \"http://www.acm.usl.edu/~dca6381/c2_mirror/princip.html\">Extropian \nprinciples</A> to be unearthed in such a \nmorass of \"liberation theology\". Extropians are intimately tied to \nhumanism in its philisophical base(feeling that the \"supernatural\" and/or \nwhatever is considered \"outside\" the range of human knowledge or power is \nultimately a pointless and backward unit of study), but attempt to \ntranscend the limits of humanism. Thus, they term themselves as \n\"transhumanists\", they believe that we can transcend physical limitations \nof our biology, culture and environment through the wise and creative use \nof science and technology. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n</OL>\n\n<hr>\nSubmitted February 07, 1995 for <A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ics1c/\">\nICS 1C</a>\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
