And \nonly have edges &amp; corners on the nets yet (working on finding the faces).\n\nI've only got partial solutions for 7, 8 and 9 faces.\n\nIt would help a lot if someone can tell me how many different polyhedra have 7 \nfaces; even more if someone has a computer program that plays around with \npolyhedral (or other) nets.\n\nBy the way:\nStage 1 is finding all polyhedra with a given number of faces;\nStage 2 is adding extra nodes on edges and matching these to each given 2-D \ngeometric figure;\nStage 3 is comparing nets face by face for possible correspondences and \nconstructing constraint equations;\nStage 4 is finding dependencies in the constraint equations and solving them \nif possible.\n\nDavid Paterson\nCSIRO DBCE Melbourne.\n\n\"Puissant Baal complies.\nHe desires a cow-calf in Dubr,\n     A heifer in Shihlmemat-field;\nLies with her times seventy-seven.\n    [...]... times eighty-eight.\n    She [conc]eives and gives birth to Math.\"\n\nPoems about Baal and Anath\nTrans H.L.
