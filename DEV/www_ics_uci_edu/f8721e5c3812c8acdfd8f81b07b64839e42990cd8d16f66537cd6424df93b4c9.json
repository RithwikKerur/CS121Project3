Operating systems exist to create an environment in which \r\ncompelling applications come to life. They do that by providing abstractions \r\nbuilt on the services provided by hardware. We argue that advances in hardware \r\nand networking technology enable a new kind of operating system to support \r\ntomorrow&#8217;s applications. Such an operating system would raise the level of \r\nabstraction for developers and users, so that individual computers, file \r\nsystems, and networks become unimportant to most computations in the same way \r\nthat processor registers, disk sectors, and physical pages are today.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Introduction</B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>The users, operators, and programmers of distributed systems \r\nface many problems. Users of the World Wide Web are subjected to random \r\nperformance and service disruptions. Replacing or upgrading a personal computer, \r\nworkstation, or server is very difficult. Even a moderate size computer network \r\nrequires significant expertise to configure and maintain. The principal \r\nprogramming abstractions available today&#8212;processes, threads, files, and \r\nsockets&#8212;do not adequately address the problems of managing locality, \r\navailability, or fault tolerance.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>We believe that a distributed operating system, based on a few \r\nprinciples pervasively applied, could address these problems. Such a system \r\nwould enforce extreme location transparency&#8212;any code fragment might run \r\nanywhere, any data object might live anywhere&#8212;and the system would manage the \r\nlocality, replication, and migration of computations and data. The system would \r\nbe self-configuring, self-monitoring, and self-tuning. And of course, it would \r\nbe scalable and secure.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>As part of the Millennium project at Microsoft Research, we are \r\nattempting to design and build such a system. We do not harbor the conceit that \r\nit will be possible to be fully successful in such an endeavor, but we do feel \r\nthat the time is right for radical experimentation.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>This position paper describes our goals for the system and some \r\nprinciples that support those goals. We then discuss relevant technology trends \r\nand consider some examples of what such a system would be like. Finally, we \r\ndiscuss related research efforts and conclude.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Goals</B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Our goal is to dramatically improve users&#8217; computational \r\nexperience. To that end, the system should have at least the following \r\nproperties:</FONT></P>\r\n<UL>\r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Seamless distribution.</B> The system should determine \r\n  where computations execute or data resides, moving them dynamically as \r\n  necessary. Users should be able to use any computing device that is part of \r\n  the distributed system as naturally and productively as they would use the \r\n  machine on their desk or in their den at home.</FONT> \r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Worldwide scalability.</B> Logically there should be only \r\n  <I>one</I> system, although at any one time it may be partitioned into many \r\n  pieces. For example, disconnected or weakly-connected operation creates \r\n  temporary network partitions.</FONT> \r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Fault-tolerance.</B> The system should transparently \r\n  handle failures or removal of machines, network links, and other resources \r\n  without loss of data or functionality. This should hold true for both the \r\n  system itself and for its applications. </FONT>\r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Self-tuning.</B> The system should be able to reason about \r\n  its computations and resources, allocating, replicating, and moving \r\n  computations and data to optimize its own performance, resource usage, and \r\n  fault-tolerance.</FONT> \r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Self-configuration.</B> New machines, network links, and \r\n  resources should be automatically assimilated.</FONT> \r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Security.</B> Although a single system image is presented, \r\n  data and computations may be in many different trust domains, with different \r\n  rights and capabilities available to different security principals. Like the \r\n  Internet, the system should allow non-hierarchical trust domains with no \r\n  central authority necessary.</FONT> \r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Resource controls.</B> Both providers and consumers may \r\n  explicitly manage the use of resources belonging to different trust domains. \r\n  For instance, while some people might be content to allow their data and \r\n  computations to use any resources available anywhere, some companies might \r\n  choose, for instance, not to store or compute their year-end financial \r\n  statement on their competitor&#8217;s machines.</FONT> </LI></UL>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Principles</B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>To achieve these goals, we propose a distributed operating \r\nsystem built on the principles of aggressive abstraction, storage-irrelevance, \r\nlocation-irrelevance, just-in-time binding, and introspection:</FONT></P>\r\n<UL>\r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Aggressive abstraction.</B> The level of abstraction \r\n  should be raised to the point that application programmers are freed from the \r\n  mechanics of distributed programming and the exigencies of physical computing \r\n  components. This would allow them to focus on application concerns&#8212;actually \r\n  solving a problem for a user&#8212;rather than system concerns such as communication \r\n  or fault tolerance. To the greatest extent possible, the system should handle \r\n  difficult issues like data placement, resource location, fault-tolerance, and \r\n  load-balancing.</FONT> \r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Storage-irrelevan</B><STRONG>ce.</STRONG> There should be \r\n  no storage hierarchy. Once created, information should be accessible until it \r\n  is no longer needed or referenced.</FONT> \r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Location-irrelevance. </B>Objects should be allowed to \r\n  reference each other and invoke operations without regard for their current \r\n  location or replication state. The system should have a seamless appearance \r\n  despite its underlying distributed nature. </FONT>\r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Just-in-time binding. </B>Bindings to particular \r\n  computations, data, and hardware resources should be made only when actually \r\n  required, preventing applications from creating bindings that would interfere \r\n  with distribution or fault tolerance. Computations or data could be \r\n  arbitrarily duplicated and bindings made to one instance would be equivalent \r\n  to bindings to other instances. Just-in-time binding would enhance resource \r\n  access and management as the operating system could redirect access to a \r\n  resource at any time or for any reason to an equivalent entity.</FONT> \r\n  <LI><FONT size=2><B>Introspection. </B>The system should possess some aspects \r\n  of self-examination and reflection. It should pervasively monitor itself and \r\n  its applications, and reason about configuration and performance issues. Its \r\n  models of its own configuration and operation should suggest opportunities for \r\n  self-tuning as well as generate suggestions for physical configuration changes \r\n  or upgrades that would improve performance. </FONT></LI></UL>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Aggressive abstraction addresses a number of the goals that we \r\nhave laid out. The system should provide applications with highly abstract \r\nvirtual machine semantics. Defining computations in software terms, independent \r\nof any particular platform or configuration, would allow state to be maintained \r\nin an abstract form and only be compiled to an efficient executable form at the \r\nlast possible moment. Because the operating system would retain ultimate control \r\nover computation, typical applications would not even be able to express access \r\nto low-level system resources. This would allow the operating system to protect \r\ncomputations from each other, transparently migrate and distribute them, and \r\nintercede in their access to resources.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Storage and location irrelevance address the issue of seamless \r\ninteraction with information independent of its properties. Interactive users \r\ncould walk up to any computer anywhere and have their active applications and \r\npersonal data follow them. Programs should work the same regardless of how their \r\ncomponents are distributed.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>The Internet provides good examples today of the kind of \r\njust-in-time binding we would extend to all object interactions. Server names \r\nand addresses on the Internet often do not refer to specific resources but to \r\ncollections of systems that take on an Internet \"identity\" or address for a \r\nparticular collection of users. Users are becoming accustomed to what can best \r\nbe described as \"binding-by-search\" as information is referenced not by name but \r\nby keyword or attributes.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Introspection guarantees that the system should take \r\nresponsibility for determining where a computation executes or data resides. The \r\nprogrammer should not have to decide whether code will execute at a \"client\" or \r\n\"server.\" Instead the system&#8217;s assessment of its hardware resources and usage \r\npatterns should determine the placement of computations and data. This would \r\nallow the operating system to provide fault tolerance, high availability, and \r\nself-tuning behavior for applications.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Technology Trends</B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>While it might seem extreme to pervasively apply these \r\nprinciples to the point of removing from programmers many of the decisions \r\ncurrently seen as important in application development, this approach to \r\noperating system design is really just an extrapolation of current trends. \r\nThroughout the history of computer science, advances in operating system and \r\nprogramming language design have raised the level of abstraction and removed \r\ncontrol from application programmers.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>This trend is inevitable. It is driven by the continuing \r\nexponential increase in the performance of computing hardware. In any software \r\nproject, there is a tradeoff between the amount of programming effort, the \r\napplication functionality, and the resulting performance. Better hardware means \r\nthat there is more performance available to be spent on increased functionality \r\nand reduced development cost. Furthermore, the relationship between more \r\npowerful abstractions and development cost is non-linear. It is hard to imagine \r\nany amount of engineering effort producing a system like today&#8217;s World Wide Web \r\nusing only 1950&#8217;s software technology, even if it were running on modern \r\nhardware. (Admittedly, there are occasional setbacks to this trend in which \r\npeople focus on bypassing abstractions for improved performance.)</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Many advances in operating systems and networking both \r\ndemonstrate this trend and provide some technical underpinnings for another step \r\nforward. Distributed file systems [e.g.,&nbsp;Anderson et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96, \r\nKistler&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Satya&nbsp;92] have succeeded in providing efficient \r\nlocation-transparent access to data. Some recent file system work \r\n[Wilkes&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96, Neefe&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96] focuses on \r\nauto-configuring and self-tuning for different loads. Network auto-configuration \r\nat the LAN level [Rodeheffer&nbsp;&amp; Schroeder&nbsp;91, Thomson&nbsp;&amp; \r\nNarten&nbsp;96] is increasingly possible. Distributed garbage collection remains \r\na difficult problem, but progress is being made [Ferreira&nbsp;&amp; \r\nShapiro&nbsp;94]. Systems for distributing parallel work now exist \r\n[Geist&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;94, Livny&nbsp;95].</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Programming languages and compilers provide evidence of a \r\nsimilar evolution. What were once programmer decisions have increasingly been \r\nautomated. Where once it was routine to write in assembly language, now in most \r\ncases a compiler for a higher level language like C++ does almost as well. \r\nDebugging, portability, and maintainability are improved, and the compiler is \r\nbetter able to analyze a myriad of details to optimize instruction selection and \r\nscheduling, register allocation and spilling, etc. Today, this trend is \r\ncontinuing with the popularity of easy-to-use environments like Java, Visual \r\nBasic, and Delphi. The emphasis in the tools industry is shifting from code \r\nefficiency to rapid application development with wizards that automatically \r\ngenerate scaffolding or framework code. Virtual machine environments with \r\njust-in-time compilation [Adl-Tabatabai&nbsp;96, Arnold&nbsp;&amp; \r\nGosling&nbsp;96] extend the programmer&#8217;s insulation from processor architecture \r\ndetails, delaying that binding until run time.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>What would such a system be like?</B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Given a distributed system with the properties described above, \r\nhow might it function in practice? In this section, we present several scenarios \r\nthat highlight the major aspects of our position.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>A New Machine</I></B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>A user purchases and installs a new personal computer or \r\nworkstation. The hardware vendor has done a good job with the cables and \r\nconnectors, so plugging the system together is easy. The user plugs the power \r\nand network cables into the wall and flips the power switch. From the moment \r\nthat a boot ROM, or perhaps a boot loader on disk, downloads code from the \r\nnetwork, the new machine joins the Millennium system. The user has full access \r\nto Millennium with no human-managed configuration activities required. \r\nMillennium evaluates the hardware resources of the new computing device that it \r\nhas acquired and starts to shift computations and data in response.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>A New Network</I></B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>An administrator sets up a new office network. After connecting \r\nthe various computers, links, and routers, the network is initially quiescent. \r\nThe administrator inserts a Millennium installation DVD disk into one of the \r\nmachines and the system propagates across the network. After evaluating the \r\nnetwork topology and hardware resources, Millennium might suggest that one of \r\nthe more powerful machines (a \"server\") be moved to a different network location \r\nfor best performance. At some point, the administrator connects the office \r\nnetwork to the Internet, and the office instantiation of the Millennium system \r\nmerges with the worldwide system.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>Hardware Failure</I></B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>An office computer goes down&#8212;perhaps a power supply has burned \r\nout. The Millennium system reconfigures around the missing machine. While the \r\ncomputer still ran, computations and data stored on it were either automatically \r\nreplicated to other systems or logged so that they could be rerun or recomputed. \r\nAt the time of the failure, Millennium identifies unique state that was not \r\nreplicated and must be reconstructed and initiates those computations \r\nautomatically. In general, users may detect a hesitation as the system moves or \r\nrecreates data they attempt to access, but otherwise they are unaware of the \r\nchange. An interactive user of the failed machine shifts to another machine and \r\nresumes work immediately or simply plugs in a replacement.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>Web Service</I></B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>A little-known web site suddenly achieves popularity, perhaps \r\nwith a link from Cool Site of the Day<SUP>SM</SUP> or a mention in a prominent \r\nnews story. Word of mouth spreads, and soon the web site&#8217;s servers are \r\noverwhelmed. Or rather, would have been overwhelmed except that heuristics in \r\nthe Millennium system had noticed the new link and already started replicating \r\nthe site for increased availability. Monitored traffic increases confirm the \r\nsituation and soon the site&#8217;s data has been \"pre-cached\" across the Internet. As \r\nthe site&#8217;s usage drops over the following weeks, Millennium reallocates \r\nresources to meet new demands.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial><B><I>Distributed Programming</I></B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Consider a simple fragment of pseudo-code:</FONT></P>\r\n<BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n  <P><FONT face=\"Courier New\" size=2>for (p = first(S); p not null; p = \r\n  next(S))<BR>if (p-&gt;age == 18 and p-&gt;height &lt; 6 and p-&gt;weight &lt; \r\n  180)<BR>count++;</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>When executed in a distributed environment, the most efficient \r\nstrategy for code like this is unclear: Should code or data be replicated or \r\nmoved? Should loop iterations be executed in parallel? And what happens to error \r\nhandling? In general, making such decisions requires knowledge of network and \r\nsystem parameters plus knowledge of current conditions.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Millennium network operations intrinsically carry code to \r\nexecute remotely, but the programmer does not deal with this explicitly. Instead \r\nthe Millennium system automatically and dynamically exploits locality and \r\nconcurrency opportunities. In the example code fragment, we believe that it is \r\nfeasible for compiler techniques to identify the conditional test as code that \r\nshould execute at the object </FONT><FONT face=\"Courier New\" \r\nsize=3>p</FONT><FONT size=2>&#8217;s location, in most circumstances. In more \r\ncomplicated scenarios, variations at run-time make it desirable to perform these \r\noptimizations dynamically or just-in-time.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Related Work</B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Several current projects share some of our goals or \r\ndirections.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>The WebOS project [Vahdat&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96, \r\nVahdat&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;97] addresses the goal of bringing distributed \r\ncomputing to the World Wide Web. The heart of the WebOS system is WebFS, a \r\nglobal file system. WebFS provides secure cache-coherent access to data. WebOS \r\nalso includes a remote execution service. WebOS can be used to build highly \r\navailable and self-tuning web services.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>The Inferno&#8482; system [Lucent&nbsp;96] integrates an operating \r\nsystem and language environment with the goal of making it easier to create \r\ndistributed services. Like Java [Arnold&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Gosling&nbsp;96], \r\nInferno creates a virtual-machine environment for applications. However, Inferno \r\nalso includes network protocols and services for distributed programming and a \r\nstand-alone implementation suitable for minimal hardware environments. (Sun is \r\nmoving Java in this direction with the development of JavaOS \r\n[Mitchell&nbsp;96].)</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>The Globe project [Steen&nbsp;96, \r\nHomburg&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;96] investigates distributed shared objects as a \r\ntechnique for building large-scale distributed systems. Local object \r\nrepresentatives hide details like replication and mobility. Local objects have a \r\nstandard internal structure that makes it easier to reuse code components. One \r\nof Globe&#8217;s major features is a hierarchical distributed location service that \r\nadapts dynamically to different usage patterns.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>Legion [Grimshaw&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;97] proposes using an \r\nextensible object model to provide a single-system model for a worldwide network \r\nof computers. Legion emphasizes high-performance parallel computing. It supports \r\nlegacy codes by encapsulating them in Legion-style object oriented wrappers. \r\nLegion automatically manages object replication and migration and supplies a \r\nsingle, persistent, global name space.</FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT face=Arial size=4><B>Conclusion</B></FONT></P>\r\n<P><FONT size=2>We have described our goals for a new distributed operating \r\nsystem. Improvements in hardware and networking technology, coupled with \r\ncontinuing operating system and programming language advances, enable the \r\ncreation of an operating system that raises the level of abstraction presented \r\nto its applications.
