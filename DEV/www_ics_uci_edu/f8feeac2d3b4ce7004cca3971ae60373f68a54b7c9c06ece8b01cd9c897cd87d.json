Take a couple of minutes to identify each other.\n    We will help form groups if necessary. <BR>\n  As you read and comment on each other&#39;s papers, keep in mind the purpose\n    and audience of the paper (that is, to convince decision-makers to support\n    the proposed changes). <BR>\n  On the editor&#39;s written comments, the editor should be sure to write\n  &quot;Edited by&quot; and his or her name.  Each author must turn in the\n  editor&#39;s written comments along with the revised version of the paper. </FONT></P>\n<OL TYPE=\"I\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Before reading the paper, talk to the author\nand get clear answers to the questions below; then answer the same questions\nfor the person editing <I>your</I> paper.</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"A\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Who is the intended audience?  Corporate executives,\nproject managers, technical people?  Who actually makes decisions about\nchanging this product?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>How much does the audience understand about\nthe software already?  Have they used it?  Do they know what its advantages\nand shortcomings are?  In other words, what background does the author <I>assume</I>\n(and thus not have to address explicitly in the proposal)?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the author expect the audience to be\nreceptive to the proposal, neutral, or hostile towards it?  What does the\nauthor estimate the chances are of approval?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n</OL>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Read your classmate&#39;s paper once through\nwithout making any comments.  Then, write down briefly your first impressions:</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"A\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Do mechanical errors get in the way of reading\nit?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Is it well organized and easy to follow?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does it do the job?  If you were the decision-maker,\nwould you spend money on this proposal (given that you have many other good\nthings to spend the money on)?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n</OL>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Read it again, more carefully, making comments\nin the margins.  Focus your comments on the organization and content; don&#39;t\nspend much time proofreading for spelling or grammatical errors (which the\nauthor should have cleaned up already).</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Write down brief answers to these questions:</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"A\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the author give the decision-makers the\nright level of information?  Is too much (or to little) assumed?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>How is the paper organized?  Can you draw\na clear outline or flowchart?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"1\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the opening paragraph make the reader\nwant to read more?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Do the paragraphs follow one another to build\na convincing argument?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Is there any place where a concept is mentioned\nthat isn&#39;t explained until later in the document?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the closing paragraph summarize the reasons\nfor making the change?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n</OL>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the author make a convincing case?  What\nelse would help persuade the decision-maker?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n</OL>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Review the author&#39;s slides, making written\ncomments on these issues:</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"A\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Content and Organization</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"1\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Do the slides &quot;walk the reader through&quot;\nthe main points of the proposal?

Can the back row of the audience\nread the important parts of these illustrations?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>If the author plans to use live, computer-based\nslides, does the &quot;live-ness&quot; add something that makes it worthwhile\nto use the technology?
