In many\ninstances, it is possible to efficiently find an approximation\nof this type that is better than known inapproximability\nlower bounds for either of the two individual optimization\nproblems forming the pair. In particular, we find either a\n(1 + epsilon)-approximation to (1; 2)-TSP or a\n1/epsilon-approximation\nto maximum independent set, from a given graph, in linear\ntime. We show a similar paired approximation result for\nfinding either a coloring or a long path. However, no such\ntradeoff exists in some other cases: for set cover and hitting\nset problems defined from a single set family, and for clique\nand independent set problems on the same graph, it is not\npossible to find an approximation when both problems are\ncombined that is better than the best approximation for\neither problem on its own.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
