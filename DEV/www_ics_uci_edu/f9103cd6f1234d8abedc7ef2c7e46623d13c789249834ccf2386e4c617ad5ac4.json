In particular, we present an algorithm that computes\nan $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-approximation\nof the statistical distance between the joint and product distributions \ndefined by a stream of $k$-tuples.\nOur algorithm requires $O(\\left({1\\over \\epsilon}\\log({nm\\over \\delta})\\right)^{(30+k)^k})$ \nmemory and a single pass over the data stream.\n\n<p>\nJoint work with Rafail Ostrovsky (UCLA). \n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
