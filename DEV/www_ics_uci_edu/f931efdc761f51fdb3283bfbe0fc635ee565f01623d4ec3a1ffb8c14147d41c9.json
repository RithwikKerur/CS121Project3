I apologize if the following\nis know to you (and the others) -- in which case, please ignore it.\n\nI think the tessellation that you describe exists -- with 2 hexagons\nand one pentagon meeting along each edge.  (In the following, I assume\nthat the truncated icosahedron is \"regular\" -- i.e. the faces are \nregular pentagons and hexagons -- and use that term instead of\nbuckyball, which may be less regular.)\n\nIn general, there seem to be a couple of considerations for the\nexistence of a tiling by a polyhedron: 1) topological or combinatorial\n-- can the tiling be extended in a consistent manner, and 2) \"metric\"\n-- does there exist a polyhedron with the right dihedral angles, edge\nlengths, etc.  \n\nIn a highly symmetric tiling (with large symmetry group), which I\nthink is what you are proposing, the combinatorial constraints can be\nchecked locally.  In particular, 4 truncated icosahedra can be placed\n(combinatorially) around a vertex in a consistent way with 2 hexagons\nand a pentagon around each edge -- the vertex figure is a non-regular\ntetrahedron with 2 \"skew\" (non-meeting) edges corresponding to\npentagons and 4 longer \"hexagon\" edges.  So there seems to be no\ncombinatorial problem.\n\nThe other consideration is: is there an edge length for which the\ndihedral angles add up to 360 degrees (the edge length determines all\nthe other geometry of a \"regular\" hyperbolic truncated icosahedron)?\nI would make the usual continuity argument for the existence of the\nproper edge length: for very small edge lengths, things are almost\nEuclidean and the 3 dihedral angles add up to more than 360 degrees;\nthe dihedral angles decrease continuously with increasing edge length\n(which can increase to infinity for an asymptotic truncated \nicosahedron).  However, the dihedral angles don't decrease to 0.\nSo the question is: does the dihedral angle sum decrease to less than\n360 degrees?  If so, the Intermediate Value Theorem says that there\nis an edge length for which the dihedral angle sum is exactly 360\ndegrees.  I think the answer to the question is \"yes\".  The hexagon-\nhexagon dihedral angle is larger than the hexagon-pentagon dihedral\nangle in the Euclidean limit (of small edge length) and I think that\nthis always remains true as the edge length is increased (this is the\nshaky part of the argument).  But there is a finite edge length at\nwhich the hexagon-hexagon dihedral angle is 120 degrees -- simply\ntruncate an icosahedron of the regular tessellation of hyperbolic\nspace by icosahedra meeting 12 at a vertex.  For this edge length,\nthe dihedral angle sum is less than 360 degrees.\n</PRE>\n[ <I>As Dunham later points out, the hexagon-pentagon dihedral is actually\nthe larger of the two, so this argument doesn't quite work -- DE</I> ]\n<PRE>\nThere may be other symmetric tessellations with more truncated\nicosahedra around the edges (and more complex vertex figures).\nAnd there may also be non-period space-filling arrangements --\nlike the Penrose tilings.  Other Archimedean solids may also\n(\"regularly\") tile hyperbolic space (or Euclidean 3-space or the\n3-sphere).\n\nI looked at Sascha Rogmann's buckyball tessellation.  It appears\nto me to be as follows (but I may be misunderstanding it): there\nare planes of pentagons and planes of hexagons.  At each vertex\nthere is one pentagon plane and two hexagon planes -- all mutually\nperpendicular.  So all dihedral angles are 90 degrees, in each\npolygon plane 4 polygons meet at a vertex, and the vertex figure\nis an octahedron (but non-regular).  The tiling of the pentagon\nplanes is regular, but the tiling of the hexagon planes is not\nregular -- the hexagon edges in pentagons planes are shorter\nthan the hexagon edges perpendicular to the pentagon planes.\nThe hexagon tiling could not be by regular hexagons, since two\ndifferent regular tilings with the same vertex valence have \ndifferent edge lengths.  Thus the buckyballs are not \"regular\"\ntruncated icosahedra.\n\nPS: Here is the answer to Bill Taylor's question: for any\npositive integers p and q with (p - 2)*(q - 2) &gt; 4, there is\na tiling of the hyperbolic plane by regular p-gons meeting\nq at a vertex (i.e. q is the vertex valence).  The edge length\nis  2*b  where  cosh(b) = cos(PI/q) / sin(PI/p)\nSo for fixed q, edge length increases with p (the fact used\nin the previous paragraph -- where q was 4 and p was 5 or 6).\n\n-- \nDoug Dunham\t\t\t\tphone: (218) 726-7510\n<A HREF=\"mailto:ddunham@d.umn.edu\">ddunham@d.umn.edu</A>\t\t\tFAX:   (218) 726-8240\nDept. of Computer Science, UMD 320HH\nDuluth, MN 55812-2496                    \n</PRE><HR><PRE>\n<B>To:</B>             <A HREF=\"mailto:ddunham@d.umn.edu\">ddunham@d.umn.edu</A>\n<B>Subject:</B>        Filling hyperbolic space with buckyballs\n<B>Date:</B>           Fri, 26 Jul 1996 10:51:11 -0700\n<B>From:</B>           David Eppstein &lt;<A HREF=\"mailto:eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU\">eppstein@ICS.UCI.EDU</A>&gt;\n</PRE><HR><PRE>\nThanks for the interesting message.

This sum\nstarts out to be more than 2 pi (at small edge length) and then decreases to\npi as the edge length goes to infinity (so for some intermediate edge length,\nthe sum is exactly 2 pi).\n\nIncidentally, out of curiosity, I borrowed a paper model of a truncated\nicosahedron (somewhat the worse for wear) and made very crude measurements\nwith a protractor of the dihedral angles.  What I found was that the pent-hex\nangle was about 147 degrees and the hex-hex angle was about 135 degrees (so \nthe dihedral angle sum starts out in the Euclidean limit to be about 430 degrees).\n\nI think the same argument can be used to show that the truncated dodecahedron\ncan also tile hyperbolic space.  The dihedral angles of the truncated tetrahedron\nand truncated cube are too small to tile hyperbolic (or Euclidean) space in this\nway (with a tetrahedral vertex figure -- but there may be other ways with more\ncomplex vertex figures); however I would guess that they do tile the 3-sphere\nin this way.

Thus we find a figure with truncated tetrahedra and truncated cubes in\nnormal 4D, in {3,3,3} and {3,4,3}, truncated octahedra tesselate 3-space,\nderived from {4,3,4}, and truncated dodecahedra and icosahedra from {3,5,3} and\n{5,3,5}.\n\nIn the case of the rhombotruncated icosahedron and rt cuboctahedron, there are\nsymmetry groups whose fundemental regions recriprocate into tilings of these\nfigures.\n\nOne can also get the truncated polytopes to tile using laminahedra, which are\npolytopes bounded by unbounded planes.  For example, in 2D, a laminahedra is a\nstrip.  One can fill the strip with anything, eg triangles or squares, without\nchanging the surface of the strip (division into equal segments).  If one wants\nto make a uniform lattice, one can stack these strips up in any way that\npreserves uniform verticies: either all squares, all triangles, or alternating\nsquare and triangle strips.\n\nIn three dimensions, the same thing can be done with plane slabs.  The sides of\nthese slabs are inscribed with the verticies of any of the two-dimensional\nuniform lattices.  We can join different slabs together, as long as they have\nthe same markings on the side: the most common case is the triangles.  Here,\nthere are triangular prisms, and slabs of oct-tet trusses.  These can be arrayed\nin different ways, eg alternating slabs of prisms and oct-tet trusses.  Since\nthe oct-tet truss exists in every dimension as a slab-lattice, one can create\nalternating lattices in any dimension.\n\nIn hyperbolic space, one can not place two flat surfaces to run equidistant from\neach other, but one can still construct figures bounded by unbounded planes.  In\nhyperbolic space, a surface that is equidistant from a flat plane is a curve.\nIf one puts poles up on the plane, the tops of the poles are further than the\nbase of them.  Let us suppose that a plane is inscribed with an {8, 3}, and we\nerect poles on its.  If the poles are high enough, the octagon that span the\ntops of this is the same as that from an {8, 4}.  The resultant figure is a\nright-angled {8, 3}.   If we keep the flat surface on the back, we get a\nslab-like figure, with a rough surface on one side and a flat one on the other,\nthe two never crossing or meeting.\n\nWe can now take our right-angled {8, 3}, and place eight of these at each\ncorner, to yield an {8, 3, 4}.  This joins all of the rough sides of the slab\nfigures, and we're left with a figure bounded by unbounded flat {8,3}'s, and\ndetail completey inside, representing the verticies, edges and planes of a\n{8,3,4}.\n\nIf now new faces were to start expandinging from the verticies of the {8, 3, 4},\nthey would eventually fill up the space within the laminae, and assume the shape\nof a truncated cube.  The octagonal faces of this are internal to the\nlaminahdra, and the triangular faces appear on the flat surfaces, to make the\nfaces inscribed with the dual {3, 8}.   Using the flat surfaces as mirrors, we\nfill all space with truncated cubes.\n\nOf course, we can use any hyperbolic lattice {p,q} and any elliptic polyhedron\n{q,r} in the same way, this means that from, for example, a {120, 5, 3}, we find\na figure bounded by laminahedra bounded by flat {5, 120}, the interior being\nbuckyballs that share their hexagonal face with another internal buckyball, and\nexpose the pentagonal face to the pentagonal surface.\n\nIn the case of laminahedra bounded by {p, 3}, the {p,3} are the same size\nregardless of how it comes (this is because angle-angle-angle is a congurance in\nhyperbolic geometry), and so it is possible to tile space with alternate\nlaminahedra inscribed with, say {8, 3, 3} and {8, 3, 5}, yielding a honeycomb\nmade of truncated tetrahedra and truncated icosahedra, eight of each to a\nvertix.\n\nOf the cuboctahedron, the icosadodecahedron and rhombi-icosadodecahedron, the\nvertix figure of these are reptangles where the opposite sides are of the same\nnature, different to the other pair.  If the vertix figure closes, it would be\nmade of made entirely of quadralaterals (eg cube, rhombic dodecahedron).\nConsider a line that joins the opposite sides of these quadralaterals.  Since\nthey have no means to end or to cross themselves, the tiling must be done in\nsuch a way that these lines are unbounded (either circles or open lines) and\nnon-crossing.  One possible tiling is a solution topologically equal to a {4,\n2p}.  With p=1, we get a solution where the polyhedra are stuck back to back.\nWith the case of p=2, the figure honeycomb is hyperbolic, but the verticies\nreside at infinity.  When p&gt;2, the lines run perpendicular to a plane, and\nthence we can pass infinite planes through this.  This cuts off the corners of\nthe figure, and replaces these by a quadralateral.  This rhombitruncates the\nicosadodecahedra and cuboctahedra, but he rbombi-icosahedra does not become\nanything uniform.\n\nOf the rhombicuboctahedron, the vertix figure is a reptangle, with three sides\nbecominging squares, and the fourth a triangle.  We can 'mark' three edges of\nthe cube with a '3' so that each face has just one marked side.   Rhombic\nDodecahedra and tricontahedra might also be so done.  Whether these yield\nfigures is open.\n\nThe snub cube and dodecahedron have pentagonal corners, and so a dodecahedron is\nthe the likely vertix figure.  One marks six of the sides with a 4 or 5,\nrepresenting the six sides that become squares or pentagons.  There is more than\none way to do this, for example, the edges containing the inscribed octahedron,\nor the six edges that are parallel to the equator when the poles are at the\nverticies.  In the case of the snub tetrahedron, this yields the {3,5,3}.  It\nmay be possible, but the thing would be relatively large.\n\nIn conclusion.  We find the truncated and rhombitruncated polyhedra (2 p | q and\n(2 p q |) in many different forms, the semiregular ones (2 | 3 4), (2| 3 5) and\n(3 5|2) have none, and the snub figurus (|2 3 q) and the (3 4|2) may have one or\nso.\n\nWarren Krieger\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
