Each author must turn in the\neditor&#39;s written comments along with the revised version of the paper.\n</FONT></P>\n<OL TYPE=\"I\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>If the author does not have a short outline,\npresenting the argument like a syllogism (i.e., listing each of the supporting\npoints&mdash;the &quot;premises&quot;&mdash;and then the conclusion), ask him or her\nto prepare one.  (This was part of the assignment.)</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Then read the outline&mdash;not the paper (yet)&mdash;and\nwrite the answers to these questions:</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"A\">\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>What is the issue?  What is the author&#39;s\nposition--what does the author want the policy maker to do?  Is the recipient\nthe right person to take that action?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Do the author&#39;s points actually support\nthe conclusion?  Are there missing points or hidden assumptions that the\nauthor didn&#39;t list?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Are there flaws in the author&#39;s logic?\n That is, <I>if you accept the premises,</I> does the conclusion follow\nlogically?  If not, how would you correct the reasoning?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>If you disagree with the author&#39;s position,\npresumably it&#39;s because you don&#39;t accept his or her premises.  Which\nones don&#39;t you agree with?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>If you agree with the author&#39;s position,\nwhich of the premises will the author&#39;s opponents most likely disagree\nwith? </FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n</OL>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Now read the letter and write answers to these\nquestions:</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<OL TYPE=\"A\">\n<LI>Is the letter in standard business-letter format (without &quot;139W&quot; or a student ID)?</LI>\n<BR><LI>Does it address an actual person? Does it address the <em>right</em> person (someone who can take the action the author is advocating)?</LI>\n<BR><LI>Does it say what action the author wants the recipient to take, in the very first sentence? [This is almost always the right approach in this kind of letter; there needs to be a good reason to do it differently.]</LI>\n<BR><LI>\n  <FONT  SIZE=4>Does the organization of the letter match\n    the organization of the outline?  Where do they diverge?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the prose in the letter accurately reflect\neach point in the outline?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the prose in the letter adequately <I>support</I>\neach point in the outline?  How well does the letter explain the basis for\neach point?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>How well does it anticipate possible objections?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does the author engage in emotionalism, name-calling,\nor other flaws of argumentation?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does it follow the appropriate tone, style,\nand form of address for a letter to a policy maker?  Does it read more like\nan essay or a research report?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Does it do the job?  Are you convinced by\nthe reasoning?  What would make the case stronger?  What needs to be improved\nbefore the author could actually send the letter?</FONT></LI>\n<BR>\n</OL>\n<LI>\n<FONT  SIZE=4>Review your comments with the author (and\nvice versa)</FONT></LI>\n</OL>\n<BR CLEAR=ALL>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
