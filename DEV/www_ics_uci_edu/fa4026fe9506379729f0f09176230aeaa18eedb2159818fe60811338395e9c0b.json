It replicates\nitself every 13 generations, on a one-dimensional 4-unit grid.\nThe same replicator works also in B3678/S12578.\n\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=\"b368s12578.lif\"><IMG SRC=\"b368s12578.gif\"\nWIDTH=23 HEIGHT=7 ALT=\"B368/S12578 4c/13 replicator\"></A></DIV></P>\n\n<P>Arbitrarily high period oscillators can be made by terminating a row of\nreplicators by still lifes in any of several ways.\n\n<P>This rule has\n<A HREF=\"http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b368s12578/\">several\nknown spaceships</A>, including a small c/8 diagonal glider.\nAs I discovered, two replicator-based oscillators can crash to form a\nglider and some random debris, which can be removed by more replicators.\nThe following cleaned-up versions of this glider gun idea\nwere made by Dean Hickerson.\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=\"b368s12578-gun52.lif\"><IMG\nSRC=\"b368s12578-gun52.gif\" WIDTH=247 HEIGHT=171\nALT=\"B368/S12578 p52 glider gun\"></A></DIV></P>\n<P><DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A HREF=\"b368s12578-gun104.lif\"><IMG SRC=\"b368s12578-gun104.gif\" WIDTH=415 HEIGHT=51\nALT=\"B368/S12578 p104 glider gun\"></A></DIV></P>\n\nIt would be of interest to find puffers or spaceships based on this\nreplicator, that move at speed 4c/13.\nHowever, much slower spaceships may also exist:\nDean Hickerson has found \"<A HREF=\"b368s12578-push.lif\">push</A>\"\nand \"<A HREF=\"b368s12578-pull.lif\">pull</A>\"\nreactions in which a set of replicators pushes or pulls a still life by\ntwelve units.  It should be possible to set up\narbitrarily-slow replicator-based spaceships in which a set of\nreplicators periodically forms a push reaction at the front end and a\npull reaction at the other end.  However, the likely size of these\nthings is so huge\n(exponential in the period) that no explicit example has been made.\n\n<HR><P>\n<A HREF=\"index.html\">Replicators</A> --\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/ca/\">Cellular Automata</A> --\n<A HREF=\"/~eppstein/\">D.
