Cook and Alexander L. Wolf\nin <I>Proceedings of the Third International Conference on the Software Process\n(ICSP3)</I>, pages 33-44, Reston, VA, October 1994.\n\n<H2> Abstract </H2>\n\nTo a great extent, the usefulness of a formal model of a software process\nlies in its ability to accurately predict the behavior of the executing\nprocess.  Similarly, the usefulness of an executing process lies largely in\nits ability to fulfill the requirements embodied in a formal model of the\nprocess.  When process models and process executions diverge, something\nsignificant is happening.  We are developing techniques for uncovering\ndiscrepancies between models and executions under the rubric of \"process\nvalidation\".  Further, we are developing metrics for process validation\nthat give engineers a feel for the severity of the discrepancy.  We\nview the metrics presented here as a first step toward a suite of useful\nmetrics for process validation.\n\n<P>\n\n<HR>\n<ADDRESS>\n<A HREF=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/Arcadia/\">The Arcadia Project\n&lt;arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu&gt;</A><BR>\nLast modified: Mon Feb 27 11:35:58 1995\n</ADDRESS>\n</BODY></HTML>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
