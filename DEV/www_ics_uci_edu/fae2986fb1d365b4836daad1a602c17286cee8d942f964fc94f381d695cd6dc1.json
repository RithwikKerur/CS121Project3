The aim is\nto get a fast algorithm using few colors.  Linial showed a vertex-coloring\nalgorithm working in time O(log* n) and using O(Delta^2) colors.  We\nimprove both the time and the number of colors simultaneously by showing\nan algorithm working in time O(log* (n/Delta)) and using O(Delta) colors.\nThis is the first known O(Delta) vertex coloring distributed algorithm\nwhich can work faster than in polylogarithmic time.\n</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
