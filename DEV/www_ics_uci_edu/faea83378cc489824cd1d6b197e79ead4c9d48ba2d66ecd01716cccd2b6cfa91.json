Our data structure combines\nthe best features of two well-known data structures, in that it\nhas the well-defined ``box''-shaped regions of region quadtrees\nand the logarithmic-height search and update hierarchical\nstructure of skip lists. We provide efficient algorithms for\ninserting and deleting points in a skip quadtree, as well as\nfast methods for performing point location queries, approximate\nrange queries, and approximate nearest neighbor queries.\n<p>\nThis is a joint work of David Eppstein, Michael Goodrich and\nJonathan Sun.\n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
