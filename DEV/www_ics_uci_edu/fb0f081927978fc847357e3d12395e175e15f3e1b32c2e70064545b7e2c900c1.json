The use of email is rapidly \nincreasing, changing teaching, learning, research, health care, business, and \nadministration. Pine is a sophisticated yet easy-to-use email program that was \ncreated at the University of Washington with the specific goal of being \nresponsive to new email users. Pine offers:\n<P>\n\n<UL>\n  <LI>\n  <B>On-Screen Menus and Messages:</B> Pine displays your options in menus at \n   the bottom of each screen, so you do not need to memorize commands. \n   On-screen messages appear on a line above the command menu to give you \n   warnings or information as you make a choice.\n  <P>\n\n  <LI>\n   <B>Online HELP:</B> Help is instantly available to provide information about \n   the task you are performing.\n</UL>\n<HR>\n<H2><A NAME=\"about_document\">About This Document</A></H2>\n<HR>\n<P>\n\nThis document should be read at your computer while you use Pine. The text\nthat follows does not tell you everything about Pine. It only introduces\nPine's main options and summarizes basic email guidelines. The best way to\nlearn to use Pine is to explore it on your own. Pine was designed to make\nit easy for you to learn to use email: there is information on each screen\nand in the online help that shows you what to do or answers your\nquestions. Try the different options and have fun experimenting with Pine. \n<P>\n<HR>\n<H2><A NAME=\"before_start\">Before You Start Pine</A></H2>\n<HR>\n<P>\n\nBefore you can use Pine to correspond by email, you need to have a userid (an \naccount) on a computer and log in. For details, see the computing consultant \nfor your department.\n<P>\n<HR>\n<H2><A NAME=\"starting_quitting\">Starting and Quitting Pine</A></H2>\n<HR>\n<P>\n\n<B>To start:</B> The details of how to start Pine vary considerably from site to\nsite.  Consult your local support staff for further information. After\nstarting Pine, the Main Menu screen appears. Each Pine screen has a\nsimilar layout: the top line tells you the screen name and additional\nuseful information, below that is the work area (on the Main Menu screen,\nthe work area is a menu of options), then the message/prompt line, and\nfinally the menu of commands. \n<P>\n\n<B>To quit:</B> When you want to leave Pine, type <B>Q</B> (Quit). For details, see \n\"Quitting Pine and Logging Out\".\n<P>\n\n<B>The Main Menu</B>\n<P>\n\nThe Main Menu lists Pine's main options (see Figure 1). The letter you must \ntype to enter your choice is to the left of each option or command name. You \ncan usually type either uppercase or lowercase letters, and you should not \npress <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B> to enter commands.\n<P>\n\n>From the Main Menu, you can read online help, write and send a message, look \nat an index of your mail messages, open or maintain your mail folders, update \nyour address book, configure or update Pine, and quit Pine.\n<TT>\n<P>  \n<PRE>\n<HR>\nPINE 3.90   MAIN MENU            Folder:INBOX   2 Messages\n<P>\n   ?

Think carefully\n    before you\n    answer--it may be that you do not want your reply to be sent to more \n    than \n    just the author of the message. It is always a good idea to verify that the \n    addresses in the To: and Cc: fields are correct before you send a message.\n<P>\n</UL>\n<HR>\n<H2><A NAME=\"folders\">Pine Folders</H2>\n<HR>\n<P>\n\nIncoming messages may quickly accumulate in your INBOX folder. Imagine \nwhat it would be like to find one hundred messages there. If you use email \noften, this may happen sooner than you expect. How should you organize the \nmessages you wish to save?\n<P>\n\n<B>Organizing Messages With Folders</B>\n<P>\n\nA Pine folder, like a folder in your file cabinet, is a storage place for\nmessages.  As you use email, you accumulate many messages and can organize\nthem into different folders by topic, correspondent, date, or any other\ncategory that is meaningful to you. You can create your own folders, and\nPine automatically provides three: \n<P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n   <B>The INBOX folder</B>--messages sent to you are listed in this folder. When \n    you first start Pine and go to the Folder Index screen, you are\n    looking at the\n    list of messages in your INBOX folder. Every incoming message remains in \n    your INBOX until you delete it or save it in another folder.\n<P>\n<LI>\n   <B>The saved-messages folder</B>--copies of messages you save are stored in \n    this folder unless you save them to other folders you create yourself. See \n    \"Saving a Message\". \n<P>\n<LI>\n   <B>The sent-mail folder</B>--copies of messages you send are automatically \n    stored in this folder. This is convenient if you cannot remember whether \n    you actually sent a message or if you want to send a message again. \n</UL>\n<B>Keeping Folders Clean</B>\n<P>\n\nMessages--whether they are in your INBOX or your other Pine folders--occupy\nstorage space, and your storage space is limited. \n<P>\n<UL>\n<LI>\n    Check your email frequently to see if you have any new messages. \n<P>\n\n    Do not keep too many messages in your INBOX folder. A large INBOX \n    reduces performance: it takes longer to display large lists of messages \n    when you start Pine, and it requires more time to move between messages.\n<P>\n\n    Delete your incoming messages right away if you do not want them, or save \n    them to other folders if you do.\n<P>\n<LI> \n    Routinely delete obsolete messages from all of your Pine folders.\n<P>\n<LI>\n    You will get a monthly message via Pine that asks if you want to delete \n    entire sent-mail folders (and all the messages they contain) from previous \n    months. To conserve space, it is a good idea to do this. If you choose to \n    delete such sent mail, type <B>y</B>.\n</UL> \n<P>\n\n<B>Moving Between Folders</B>\n<P>\n\nWhen you start Pine and press <B>I</B> (Index) at the Main Menu, you see a list of \nmessages in your INBOX folder.

If you are a Pine beginner, this is probably your INBOX \n    folder. See \"Moving Between Folders\", if the message you want \n    to mark for deletion is in a folder other than your INBOX.\n\n<P>\n<LI>\n    At the Folder Index screen, select the message you want to mark for \n    deletion, or simply view the message.\n<P>\n<LI>\n    Type <B>D</B> (Delete). \n<P>\n\n    If you are looking at the Folder Index screen when you mark a message for \n    deletion, a \"D\" appears in the left-hand column of the message line. \n<P>\n\n    If you are looking at the Message Text screen when you mark a message for \n    deletion, a \"DEL appears in the upper right corner of your screen.

You can expunge a message that is marked for deletion at any time, or you \ncan wait until you quit Pine. Once you have a few messages marked for \ndeletion, you may want to expunge them before you continue to work, because \nit is easier to look through a folder index that contains fewer messages. \n<P>\n\n<I>To expunge a message:</I>\n<P>\n<OL>\n<LI>\n    At the Folder Index screen, type <B>X</B> (Expunge).\n<P>\n\n    You are asked: \n<P>\n\n   <TT> Expunge \"#\" message(s) from \"folder\"?</TT> \n<P>\n<LI>\nType <B>y</B> (yes) or press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B>.\n<P>\n\n    Messages marked for deletion disappear.\n</OL>\n\nNote that you will be asked whether you want to expunge messages that are \nmarked for deletion when you leave a folder (other than the INBOX) that \ncontains messages marked for deletion, or when you quit your Pine session.\n<P>\n<HR>\n<H2><A NAME=\"address\">Using the Address Book</A></H2>\n<HR>\n<P>\n\nAs you use email, you build a list of email correspondents.

Messages can be\nreplied to or forwarded with speed and ease, and email has the potential\nto reach a wide audience. These features can also be misused. There are a\nfew basic guidelines for the responsible use of email that can help you\navoid common mistakes while you enjoy the full benefits of this\ntechnology. \n<P>\n\nThe privacy of an email message cannot be guaranteed. An email message may \nbe forwarded, printed, or permanently stored by any recipient. Email can be \nmisdirected, even when you are careful. Do not put something in an email \nmessage that you would not want read by everybody. And if you receive a \nmessage intended for someone else, let the sender know. \n<P>\n\nEmail does not show the subtleties of voice or body language. Avoid\nattempts at irony or sarcasm. The most effective email is short, clear,\nand relevant. If you receive a message that makes you upset, do not\nrespond immediately, and in any case, avoid \"flaming,\" that is, sending an\nangry or rude message. \n<P>\n\n<B>Email Tips</B>\n<P>\n\nAs you use email, keep the following tips in mind:\n<UL>\n<LI>\n    Email is easily forwarded to someone else. Although this is convenient, it \n    is not always appropriate. If you are unsure, ask the sender before you \n    forward a message. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email replies may go to more people than you realize. When replying to a \n    message, be sure to look at the list of recipients. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email can be junk mail, so avoid unnecessary proliferation of messages. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email takes up computer space, so delete messages you no longer need. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    The integrity of an email message cannot be guaranteed. If a received \n    message seems out of character for the sender, double-check before taking \n    it seriously. \n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email is meant for informal correspondence as well as scholarly,\n    scientific,\n    and clinical communications. You should not use email for official record \n    purposes where a memo would be required (e.g., personnel actions, \n    organization changes, contracts, and policy statements).\n<P>\n<LI>\n    Email should not be considered private. Confidential information should \n    not be sent by email.\n</UL>\n<HR>\n<H2><A NAME=\"quitting\">Quitting Pine and Logging Out</A></H2>\n<HR>\n<P>\n\n<I>To quit Pine:</I>\n<OL>\n<LI>\n    At almost any place in Pine, type <B>Q</B> (Quit). \n<P>\n\n    You are asked:\n<P>\n\n    <TT>Really quit pine?</TT>\n<P>\n<LI>\n    Type <B>y</B> (yes) or press <B>&lt;Return&gt;</B> to quit. \n<P>\n</OL>\nIt is a good idea to log off your computer whenever you are through with it or \nwhen you must leave it unattended.\n\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n \n", "encoding": "ISO-8859-1"}
