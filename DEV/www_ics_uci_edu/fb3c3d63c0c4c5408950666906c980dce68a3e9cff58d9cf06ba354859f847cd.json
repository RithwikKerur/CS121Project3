This has caused growing pains as HTTP\u2019s original specification called for it to remain as simple a protocol as possible. \r\n<BR></UL><UL>\r\nThis presentation will suggest introducing a number of new methods and headers. Their purpose is two fold: To help clearly define functionality and to allow servers to easily choose what functionality they wish to support.\r\n</UL><UL>\r\nDifferent servers have different roles and will not need to support all of HTTP\u2019s functionality. By carefully compartmenting different aspects of HTTP we give servers the freedom they need to pick and choose functionality.\r\n</UL><UL>\r\nThis presentation will also suggest method specific headers. HTTP has strived to achieve orthogonality between its headers and methods but as HTTP\u2019s functionality becomes richer orthogonality becomes a hindrance rather than a boon. Shall we create a History method when we can have a Get specific History header?</UL> </P> \r\n\r\n</Body>\r\n</HTML>\r\n", "encoding": "Windows-1252"}
