Aumann and M.\nBender. The authors showed fault tolerant versions of three common\ndata structures. In this talk, we will cover fault tolerant\nversions of stack and the linked list in detail.</p>\n\n<p>Paper Abstract:</p>\n\n<p>We consider the tolerance of data structures to memory faults.\nWe observe that many pointer-based data structures (e.g. linked\nlists, trees, etc.) are highly nonresilient to faults. A single\nfault in a linked list or tree may result in the lost of the entire\nset of data. In this paper we present a formal framework for\nstudying the fault tolerance properties of pointer-based data\nstructures, and we provide fault tolerant versions of the stack,\nthe linked list, and the dictionary tree.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
