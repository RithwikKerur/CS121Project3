The idea is that among the  16 points \n(+/- A, +/- B, +/- C, +/- D), exactly two correspond to \"good\"\nconfigurations.  This is not hard to see in the probability 1 \"generic\"\ncase were A,B,C,D are distinct and no three of them lie on a great circle.\nTo make this argument completely rigorous one needs only the finite\nadditivity of the measure, that the non-generic cases have probability 0,\nthat the set of \"good\" cases *has* a measure, and that the measure be\ninvariant with respect to 180 degree rotation in any coordinate.\n\nTal  <A HREF=\"mailto:kubo@math.harvard.edu\">kubo@math.harvard.edu</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
