In fact, <A \nHREF=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTML.html\">Hypertext Markup Language</A> states that \nHTML is a generalized SGML language that can be used for a wide variety of applications.<p><A \nHREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to \nlist of questions.</it></a> <LI><A NAME=\"QQ2\"><H2>What recent UFO sightings have occured in \nEurope?</H2></A>\nAccording to <A HREF=\"http://www.bgsu.edu/~jzawodn/ufo/misc/Belgium.html\">Summary Report of \nBelgian UFO Activity</A>, the MC of the Air Defense radar station of Glons, Belgium, got a phone \ncall from a person swearing they saw three separate, brightly blinking lights in the clear sky \nabove (and they were changing colors, too!) Within the depths of an obscure <A \nHREF=\"file://ftp.rutgers.edu/pub/ufo/england.50s.Z\"> Rutgers Page</A>, an employee of England's \nJodrell Bank Observatory claimed to have scanned a strange craft flying at unearthy speeds in the \n1950's.

Vincent was also noted to \nbe a great influence on <A HREF=\"http://www.emf.net/louvre/paint/glo/fauvism/\">Fauvism</A>.  In his \npersonal life, Van Gogh was tormented by his lack of unrequitted love for both women and Christ, but he \nhad a loving brother that funded his artistic pursuits. Through the course of his \nshort ten years as an artist, Vincent managed to produce 800 paintings and an \nequal amount of sketches/renderings. <p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to list of \nquestions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ4\"><H2>What do critics have to say about Broadway's production of <STRONG>  Love! \nValour!

As \nlisted at <A HREF=\"http://www.webcom.com/~broadway/kerr.html\">Love!</A>, Michael Kuchwara of the \nAssociated Press felt the play to be \"Heartfelt and Stirring\".  Evoking similiar emotion is a \ncatalogue of 37 plays that Bill Shakespeare set into history over 400 years ago.  Each year, <A \nHREF=\"http://www.circus.com/~jasona/shakespearSantaCruz.html\">Shakespeare Santa Cruz</A> displays a \nmodernized but still terrific rendition of two Shakespeare classics.<p><A HREF=\"#Questions\"><it>Return to \nlist of questions.</it></a>\n\n<LI><A NAME=\"QQ5\"><H2>What popular European applications are available via \ntelnet?</H2></A>There are several server sights available through telnet, \nthat just happen to be located in a few obscure regions of Europe.
