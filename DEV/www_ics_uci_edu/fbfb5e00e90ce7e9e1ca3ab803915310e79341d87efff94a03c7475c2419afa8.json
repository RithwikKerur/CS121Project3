They lived in Sanok till 1939.\r\nMy grandmother Scheindl Langsam had 9 brothers and sisters.She and 3 others,\r\nalong\r\nwith others from our family all moved to Winnipeg around 1948,1949. Scheindl\r\ndied in 1960.\r\nIn Sanok, my grandfather was in the meat business. They had  5 children, one\r\nof them my mother. 1 child died in the war, the others are all in Winnipeg.\r\nIsak Chartaner and Wigdor Bernstein are not in any way connected to our\r\nfamily. My grandmother and grandfather both lived together in Winnipeg\r\nuntill 1960, the year they both passed away. We have never heard of the\r\nother 2 names.\r\nIn 1921 there were 4076 Jews in Sanok. The Langsams you speak of may be\r\na completely unrelated family. Or possibly, they may stem from one of the 9\r\nbrothers and sisters of my grandmother, details of them I am collecting from\r\nmy mother.\r\n\r\nHave you visited Sanok? Do you have street addresses for the Langsams there?\r\nThat would help as my mother remembers some street addresses.\r\nI saw your search request on the Net under Sanok in a Jewish search service.\r\n\r\nFinally, my grandmother's parents were Pesel and Pinchas Langsam from\r\nTyreva'\r\n21 km from Sanok.\r\n\r\nEarl Zimmer\r\n\r\n\r\nVancouver, Canada\r\n\r\nFrom: earzim1@home.com at INTERNET\r\nTO: Moishe Miller\r\nSubject: Re: [Fwd: Re: family history]\r\nPriority: Normal \r\nDate: 10/28/98 7:32 AM \r\n\r\n\r\nI have your letter, through Suzan and I will be back to you soon.

Avrum,\r\nSarah, Ronia, Kalman, Chaia,and Slova who all died in the war. Then there\r\nwas Anny who died in Winnipeg around 1970, Moishe langsam , my uncle who\r\ndied in Winnipeg around 15 years ago and my aunt Clara who died in Winnipeg\r\nabout 1 month ago.\r\nNow my mom is Ruth Zimmer whose mother was Scheindel. My mom lost a young\r\nbrother in the war. My mom's brother Saul, sisters  Ann and Sally all still\r\nlive in Winnipeg.\r\n\r\nClara's children are  Rosalynnwho lives in Winnipeg and Sammy Linhart who\r\nlives in Phoenix. They both have their own kids. My Brother lives in Las\r\nVegas.\r\n\r\nMoishe Langsam had no children.
