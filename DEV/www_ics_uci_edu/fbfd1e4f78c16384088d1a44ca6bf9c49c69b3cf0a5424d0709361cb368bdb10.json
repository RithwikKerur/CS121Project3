The purpose of that is\nto make it clear who owns the copyright (me) so that you don't go asking\nthe University of California or UMI (the microfiche archive company) for\nthe following permission.\n</p>\n<blockquote>\nI, Roy Thomas Fielding, hereby grant permission to You, whoever you may be,\nto copy, print, or otherwise reproduce this dissertation for non-commercial\nuse (including classroom, research, government use, or anything covered by\nthe usual notion of \"fair use\") in its\n<a href=\"fielding_dissertation.pdf\">original PDF edition</a>,\n<a href=\"fielding_dissertation_2up.pdf\">2-up PDF edition</a>, or\n<a href=\"top.htm\">HTML edition</a>,\nor excerpts thereof, provided that any such reproduction includes the\nfull reference to this work, as described below, either on the initial page\nof the reproduction or by citation to a list of references within a\nlarger work.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nIf you would like to reproduce this work for commercial purposes, as in selling\nit as a book or a significant part of a published compilation, then you\nwill have to ask for my permission separately.\n</p>\n<h2>How to reference this work</h2>\n<p>\nThere is one authoritative reference to the library archives:\n</p>\n<blockquote>\nFielding, Roy Thomas.\n<i>Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures</i>.\nDoctoral dissertation, University of California, Irvine, 2000.\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nYou may need to make some style adjustments to that, depending on the\nwriting style being used for a given reference list, such as only listing\nmy initials instead of the full given names.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe content and section numbers of this HTML edition are identical to those\nin the original.  However, if you wish to reference a page number, please see\nthe PDF editions for the correct page number.\n</p>\n<h2>Anchors</h2>\n<p>\nI have placed hypertext anchors around each of the subsection titles, with\nnames like <a href=\"net_app_arch.htm#sec_2_3\">sec_2_3</a> or\n<a href=\"web_arch_domain.htm#sec_4_1_4_2\">sec_4_1_4_2</a>, and around each\ntable, figure, and reference.  These are permanent names, so feel free to\nuse them as anchors for references within other documents.\n</p>\n<h2>Errata</h2>\n<p>\nNote that my dissertation is a permanently frozen document, so I will not\nbe changing the content in order to fix any errors I might have made in the\nresearch.  If you notice a significant error, send me an e-mail to the\ncontact address on my <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/\">home page</a>\nand I will add it to a list of errata below.\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"rest_arch_style.htm#tab_5_1\">Table 5-1</a> lists \"representation\"\n     and \"representation metadata\" as separate data elements, which is incorrect\n     because representation is defined to include both data and metadata (and\n     sometimes metametadata).  The first heading should have been\n     \"representation data\", or a single heading for representation and\n     subheadings for data and metadata.\n     <cite>[Reported by Ed Summers, 9 Jan 2010]</cite></li>\n</ul>\n<hr size=\"1\" noshade=\"noshade\" />\n<table width=\"100%\">\n<tr><td align=\"left\" valign=\"top\" nowrap=\"nowrap\">\n<i>[<a href=\"top.htm\" rel=\"parent\">Top</a>]</i>\n</td><td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n&#169; <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/\">Roy Thomas Fielding</a>, 2000.
