The only\ningredients needed for the computers above (using the sliding block\nmemory) are p68s and gliders. p68s can be built by colliding three\ngliders: \n\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"p68-synth.lif\"><img src=\n\"p68-synth.gif\" alt=\"3-glider p68 synthesis\" width=\"95\" height=\n\"43\"></a></div>\n\n<p>The glider \"side-tracking\" mechanism from Life doesn't seem to\nwork for placing gliders on perpendicular tracks arbitrarily far\naway from the replicator -- the kickback reactions I know of move\nthe track of the kicked glider inwards, towards the source of the\nglider causing the kickback, rather than outwards as in life.\nInstead, Dean suggests pushing a block to the desired track then\nhitting it with two gliders to form a third sideways-going\nglider:</p>\n\n<div align=\"CENTER\"><a href=\"block-to-glider.lif\"><img src= \n\"block-to-glider.gif\" width=\"31\" height=\"63\" alt=\n\"conversion of block to glider\"></a></div>\n\n<p>These reactions together with the glider kickbacks are\nsufficient to place gliders on arbitrary tracks, far away from the\nsource of the gliders. It remains to be seen whether these gliders\ncan all be synchronized in such a way that they put together a\ncomputer, but it seems likely that this should all work.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"/~eppstein/ca/b35s236/\">B35/S236</a> -- <a href= \n\"/~eppstein/ca/\">Cellular Automata</a> -- <a href=\"/~eppstein/\">D.\nEppstein</a> -- <a href=\"/\">UCI Inf. &amp; Comp.
