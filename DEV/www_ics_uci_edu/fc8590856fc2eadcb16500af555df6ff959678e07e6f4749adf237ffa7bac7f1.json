The problem arises naturally in\n  the context of parallel mixnet servers as well as other security\n  applications. Our analysis is based on related analyses of\n  load-balancing processes. We include extensions to variations that\n  involve corrupted servers and adversarially injected messages, which\n  correspond to an opponent who can peek at some shuffles in the buffer\n  and who can mark some number of the cards. In addition, our analysis\n  makes novel use of a sum-of-squares metric for anonymity, which leads\n  to improved performance bounds for parallel mixnets and can also be\n  used to bound well-known existing anonymity measures.</p>\n\n<p>(Joint work with Michael Mitzenmacher from ICALP 2012)</p>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
