I went to\r\nvisit Dr. Meller in the summer of 1994. He was kind enough to see me in his office.\r\nHe related that his family was from Zebrecen, Galicia. His father, Tzvi Elimelech (a\r\ncommon name in our family), was born in 1905, and married Matil Bok. His parents were\r\nPinchus &amp; Rose. The majority of the family currently resides in Santiago, Chile. Dr.\r\nMeller has a nephew there, Alan, who did some work on a family tree.

The permission [to get married]\r\nwas given in oral form by the newlyweds' respective parents who personally attended the wedding act.\r\nThe newlyweds stated that no prenuptial agreement has been contracted between them.

The bearers of the\r\nname all have the namesake of <A HREF=\"homemilr.htm#PD\">Pesach Dovid Miller</A>.\r\nIn addition, a large part of the family lived in Saros county, in the Bardejov\r\nregion. In the 1942 deportation records for Bardejov, there is a Pesach Dovid Friedman listed.\r\nThese are the particulars I could piece together:\r\nJozef Friedman, born 1866, of Bardejov, married\tBetty Hollander/Holender\r\n(born Sept 7, 1873 or Jun 20, 1875) of Zborov. They had several children.\r\nOne of them, Pesach Dovid, was born Oct. 12, 1902, in Bardejov. He married\r\nSarolta/Sara Beinhorn (b. Mar. 28, 1905) of Mukachevo. They had a son, Otto Aser\r\nFriedman (b. Sept. 16, 1933) in Kosice. He is living somewhere in the Boston area \r\nbut I have not been able to locate him. Pesach Dovid did have a living brother,\r\nSamuel, who was not able to shed any light on his grandparents. A cursory check of\r\nthe Bardejov records from 1852-1895, held by the Mormon Family History Center, did\r\nnot reveal any more information. \r\n<P>\r\n\r\n<A NAME=\"A4\"> </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<A HREF=\"#Q4\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" align=\"right\" border=0 height=31 width=19 ALT=\"\"></A>\r\n&#149;I came to this tree through a few different branches that turned\r\nout to be part of an entire tree. There are some conflicting opinions in the\r\nvarious branches of this family regarding the big picture, so I will try to stay\r\nclear of them. Here are the facts:\r\nYitzchok married Chaya Tzivya, and in 1830, in Strzyzow, they had Shabsi. He\r\nmarried Frimit Licht, in Lezajsk, where they had 6 children. In age order, they are: Moshe (b. 1860), \r\nMali, Yosef, Sara, Freida, &amp; Dovid (b. 1875). Mali, Shabsi's second child, was married (to a cousin, \r\nanother [Shabsi?] Miller?). They had Chaim Yitzchok, in the 1870's, and several other children. Most of \r\nMali's family died in a plague, in the early 1900's, in Lezajsk. In 1914, due to problems with the \r\nRussians, Shabsi returned home, to Strzyzow. He died there, at the age of 84, on the second day of Rosh \r\nHashana, 1914. Several descendants of this family remember that they had cousins that are already\r\nin our tree, making them definitely part of the big picture. It is possible that Chaya Tzivya, not her \r\nhusband Yitzchok, was the Miller.\r\n<BR>\r\n<a href=\"rpsab.htm\">Here</a> is an email collection from one of the family members.\r\n<P>\r\n<A NAME=\"A5\"> </A>\r\n<BR>\r\n<A HREF=\"#Q5\"><IMG SRC=\"img/top.gif\" align=\"right\" border=0 height=31 width=19 ALT=\"\"></A>\r\n&#149;<A HREF=\"shabsib.htm\">Shabsi Yitzchok Miller</A> of Bukowsko had a daughter,\r\n<A HREF=\"shabsib.htm#L1.2.2.8\">Bayla Chaya</A>, who married Hersh Kahan. They lived\r\nin Sighet, Rumania, where they had many children. I have not been able to locate\r\nany living survivors of this family, although I have found a lot of information.\r\nIt seems that Hersh may have died before 1926. One of their daughters, Nissel\r\n(Nellie; June 29, 1901 - August 30, 1990 [Hallandale, FL]), \r\ncame to NYC on August 17, 1926. On the ship (SS Maurentania) manifest she\r\nlists her mother's (Bayla Chaya) address as Sighatul Mantati Ilic Mares 24.\r\nNellie married Julius Harnik in 1938. They lived in the Bronx and later (1963?) moved to\r\nFlorida. They did not have children, but she did have a brother that lived in\r\nZichron Yakov, Israel, named Shabsi Kahane. He has a living son, named Tzvi.\r\nHis whereabouts are unknown. Nellie also had a niece from a sister, named Esther,\r\nsomewhere in Haifa, Israel, and a nephew somewhere in Long Island, NY. In September 1997 \r\nI received a response from my inquiry to the Search Bureau for Missing Relatives in Israel. \r\nThey told me of Bluma Zipkin, living in Tel-Aviv at 5 Kehilat Sofia Street. She is a \r\ndaughter of Shabtaj Kohen and sister to Zwi.

She is buried in Bais Moshe Cemetery, in Long\r\nIsland, NY. She had a lot of brothers and sisters. \r\nAlmost all her brothers perished in the Holocaust (1 was named Yankel Shmerel).\r\nSome sisters survived, 1 in CA , 1 in TN.

Meyer knew he had a zeide, Asher. Meyer had an aunt \r\nover 90 (Pesach's wife, Surtcha). She said Asher was a <I>chushuva</I> (important) man, from a brother of \r\nthe Bnei Yissochur.

The detail can be found within the site at:\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/brknmilr.htm#A11\r\nbut it states:\r\n\"Before her passing, I spoke with Feigy Miller, the widow of Avrohm Abba Miller. She\r\n showed me his phone book. In it was listed a Sally (Sarah) Weiss. Next to her entry was\r\n written Abba's cousin. I called Mrs. Weiss on September 5, 1993. She told me that her mother's\r\n name was Sala (Tziporah). Sala's parents were Millers living in Poland. Mrs. Weiss said she was\r\n named after her grandmother, Sala's mother. I spoke with her again on January 1, 1997. She\r\n supplied the following information. Yussel (she thinks this was his name) married Sarah. They lived\r\n in Czarny Dunajec, Galicia, and they had five children; 2 boys (Dovid &amp; another) and 3 girls (Leah,\r\n Chaya, &amp; Sela). Leah married a Kalfus and lived somewhere in Czechoslovakia. Chaya married a\r\n Stern and lived in Czarny Dunajec. Sally's mother, Sela (Faiga), as she called her this time, was the\r\n youngest, born around 1900, married to Chezkel Timberg, of Jaworzno (50 km WNW of\r\n Krakow), Galicia. They had 3 children, Dov, Sally (Sarah), &amp; Chaim. All the families, except for\r\n Sally, and a son of Dovid's, named Chaim Miller, perished in the Holocaust. Sally &amp; her cousin\r\n Chaim, moved to Israel. Sally lives in Brooklyn now. Chaim Miller lived in Ramat Gan, Israel. He\r\n passed away, but is survived by a wife and 2 children. \"\r\n\r\nRegarding the Kallech branch, please see:\r\nhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~dan/genealogy/Miller/spira/uri.htm\r\n\r\nCould you perhaps supply me with more info on your family?\r\n-Moishe Miller\r\nmoishe@langsam.com\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nDate: Sun, 27 Feb 2000 19:13:35 +0200 (IST)\r\nFrom: Gershon Lehrer <lehrer@avoda.jct.ac.il>\r\nTo: \"moishe@langsam.com\" <moishe@langsam.com>\r\nSubject: Re: Lehrer\r\n\r\nHi,\r\nHere are the answers.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nGershon Lehrer,\r\nJCT-Machon Lev,\r\nYerushalayim,\r\nErets Israel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Sat, 26 Feb 2000, moishe@langsam.com wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi,\r\n> \r\n> 1.
