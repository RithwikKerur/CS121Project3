Tools</title>\r\n</head>\r\n\r\n<body BGCOLOR=\"white\">\r\n\r\n<center>\r\n<h1>Command Line Mac Tools</h1>\r\n<p>\r\n</center>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<p>\r\nThis document shows how to create and download project files for use with the\r\n  Mac tools from the command line.\r\n<p>\r\nBefore following these instructions, you should have already downloaded and\r\n   installed the CLion software (if you haven't, go back and do so).\r\n<p>\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"100%\">\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Section 1) Testing the Mac and Clang</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this section you will create and run a trivial C++ project/program\r\n   (including editing it, and seeing how syntax errors are reported).\r\n<p>\r\nFirst, we will perform a one-time only setup.\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Start a Terminal by clickich the\r\n      <img src=\"images/commandline/terminal.png\"> (Mac Terminal icon)\r\n      on the Dock.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Perform the following actions in your come directory\r\n      (mine is <b>Richards-MacBook-Air: ~richardepattis</b>).\r\n    <ol type=\"A\">\r\n    <li>Use any editor (<b>vi</b> is automatically available on the Mac;\r\n          other editors can be downloaded)\r\n          to update your <b>~/.bash_profile</b> file to contain the following\r\n          line at the end (or put it after the other PATH settings in that file;\r\n          e.g., copy/paste it):\r\n          <b><pre>PATH=\"/Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/bin\":$PATH ; export PATH</pre></b>\r\n    <li>Terminate the Terminal and start a new Terminal (which executes the\r\n          <b>~/.bash_project</b> file automatically).\r\n    <li>Type <b>echo $PATH</b> and ensure the path you added appears.\r\n    </ol>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Now we will create directories for use in ICS-46, and create a\r\n       <b>trivialtest</b> project to ensure the required operations work\r\n       correctly.\r\n    <ol type=\"A\" start=\"4\">\r\n    <li>Make an empty directory for all ICS-46 Projects (<b>ics46projects</b>)\r\n          using the <b>mkdir</b> command.\r\n    <li>Connect to the <b>ics46projects</b> directory\r\n          using the <b>cd</b> command.\r\n    <li>Make an empty directory for the Trivial Test Project\r\n         (<b>trivialtest</b>)\r\n          using the <b>mkdir</b> command.\r\n    <li>Connect to the <b>trivialtest</b> project directory\r\n          using the <b>cd</b> command.\r\n    <li>Use any editor to create a <b>main.cpp</b> file that contains the\r\n          following code (e.g., copy/paste it):\r\n    <b><pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    cout << \"Hello, World!\" << endl;\r\n    return 0;\r\n}</pre></b>\r\n<p>\r\n    <li>Create a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file that contains the following code\r\n          (e.g., copy/paste it):\r\n    <b><pre>cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.3.2)\r\nproject(trivialtest)\r\n\r\nset(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS \"${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11\")\r\n\r\nset(SOURCE_FILES main.cpp)\r\nadd_executable(trivialtest ${SOURCE_FILES})</pre></b>\r\n<p>\r\n    <li>List the contents of the <b>ics46project/trivialtest</b> directory\r\n          storing these two files,\r\n          by using the <b>ls</b> command.\r\n    <li>Create the <b>make</b> files needed for this project,\r\n          by using the <b>cmake .</b> command (remember, you will\r\n          do this just the first time you use a project).\r\n    <li>List the contents of the <b>ics46project/trivialtest</b> directory\r\n          storing the new files it creates (and the new <b>CMakeFiles</b>\r\n          directory),\r\n          by using the <b>ls</b> command.\r\n    <li>Build the <b>trivialtest</b> file needed to execute this program,\r\n          by using the <b>make</b> command (you will do this each time\r\n          that you modify a <b>.cpp</b> file in a project).\r\n    <li>List the contents of the <b>ics46project/trivialtest</b> directory\r\n          storing the new file it creates,\r\n          by using the <b>ls</b> command.\r\n   <li>Run the <b>trivialtest</b> executable file,\r\n          by using the <b>./trivialtest</b> command.\r\n   </ol>\r\n   <p>\r\n    The following <b>~/ics46projects/trivialtest</b>\r\n      Terminal window shows all these actions (<b>D</b> through <b>O</b>).\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/trivialtest.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Use the finder to navigate to the\r\n      <b>Macintosh HD/users/yourname/ics46projects/trivialtest</b> \r\n      directory.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following Finder should appear on your screen.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/trivialtest finder.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    You can use any combination of Mac OS and Terminal command lines to\r\n       manipulate the files in this directory: whichever is simplest.\r\n    <p>\r\n    It would also be useful to make an alias to this <b>ics46projects</b> folder\r\n      and place it conveniently on the desktop, so you can easliy reach the\r\n      projects you are working on.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>Edit, rebuild, and rerun the <b>main.cpp</b> program,\r\n   <ul>\r\n   <p>\r\n   <li>Use an editor to change the <b>cout</b> to print\r\n         <b>\"Goodbye, World!\"</b>.\r\n   <li>Show the <b>main.cpp</b> program file, by using the <b>more</b> command.\r\n   <li>Rebuild the <b>trivialtest</b> file using the same <b>make</b> command.\r\n       There is no reason to use the <b>cmake</b> command here: it must be used\r\n       only if we <b>change</b> the <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file.\r\n   <li>Rerun the edited <b>trivialtest</b> file,\r\n          by using the <b>./trivialtest</b> command.\r\n   </ul>\r\n   <p>\r\n    The following <b>~/ics46projects/trivialtest</b>\r\n      Terminal window shows all these actions.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/trivialtest rebuild.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Create a syntax error (remove the <b>;</b> at the end of the <b>cout</b>\r\n      line), and then follow the rebuilding/rerunning steps above\r\n    The following <b>~/ics46projects/trivialtest</b>\r\n      Terminal window shows all these actions.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/trivialtest syntax error.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    The failed results of attempting to rebuild the program appear after the\r\n      <b>make</b> command.\r\n    In this case, the Clang compiler accurately indicates the source of the\r\n      error.\r\n    I have lengthened the window so as not cause lines to wrap.\r\n</ol>\r\nWe will now continue by learning how to download a project and run it.\r\nDuring the quarter, you will be asked to do this for all programming\r\n  assignments and many quizzes.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<hr align=\"left\" width=\"33%\">\r\n<h3>Section 2) Testing Downloadable Projects with the Course Libraries</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nIn this section you will download the course libraries and then\r\n  download/build/run a project that contains various programs that use these\r\n  libraries.\r\n<p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>If you have not already done so, make an alias to the folder\r\n      <b>Macintosh HD/users/yourname/ics46projects</b> named\r\n      named <b>ics46projects</b> and place it on your desktop.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>Download and unzip the file <a href=\"libraries.zip\">template</a>;\r\n    Copy its three directories (<b>courselib</b>, <b>googletestlib</b>, and\r\n      <b>test_all_data_types</b>) into the directory that\r\n      <b>ics46projects</b> aliases; it should already contain the\r\n      <b>trivialtest</b>  directory, created by the operations above.\r\n    <p>\r\n    Generally, whenever you download projects, you will unzip them and \r\n      then copy their directories into the directory that <b>ics46projects</b>\r\n      shortcuts.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following <b>~/ics46projects</b>\r\n      Terminal window lists these four directories.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/libraries.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Connect to the <b>test_all_data_types</b> directory,\r\n      by using the <b>cd</b> command.\r\n    Hint: type only <b>cd te</b> and then press the <b>tab</b> key and Terminal\r\n      should complete the name of this directory; generally using <b>tab</b> for\r\n      directory/file name completion can drastically reduce your typing in\r\n      Terminal.\r\n    <p>\r\n    List the contents of the <b>ics46project/test_all_data_types</b> directory,\r\n          by using the <b>ls</b> command.\r\n    Notice that this project folder contiains various <b>.cpp</b> files\r\n      and a <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> file\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following <b>~/ics46projects/test_all_data_types</b>\r\n      Terminal window shows all these actions.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/test_all_data_types.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Edit the <b>driver.cpp</b> file by uncommenting lines 30-35, so they\r\n      appear as follows\r\n    <b><pre>#include \"driver_set.hpp\"\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  ics::DriverSet d;\r\n  return 0;\r\n}</pre></b>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>Build and run the <b>main.cpp</b> program,\r\n   <ul>\r\n   <p>\r\n   <li>Create the <b>make</b> files needed for this project,\r\n         by using the <b>cmake .</b> command (recall you will\r\n         do this just the first time you use a project).\r\n   <li>Build the <b>test_all_data_types</b> file needed to execute this\r\n         program, by using the <b>make</b> command (you will do this each time\r\n         that you modify a <b>.cpp</b> file in a project).\r\n   <li>Run the <b>test_all_data_types</b> executable file,\r\n          by using the <b>./test_all_data_types</b> command\r\n          (remember to use command-completion to reduce your typing:\r\n          but since many file names start with <b>test_</b> you will\r\n          have to type <b>test_d</b> (a unique prefix for the <b>exe</b> file)\r\n          before pressing <b>tab</b>.\r\n   </ul>\r\n   <p>\r\n    The following <b>~/ics46projects/test_all_data_types</b>\r\n      Terminal window shows all these actions.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/test_all_data_types run.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Experiment with this driver by entering commands (and their arguments, when\r\n      prompted) to better understand the <b>set</b> data type.\r\n    You can enter the <b>q</b> command to terminate the driver, or you can\r\n      type <b>command-c</b> to terminate the driver.\r\n    <p>\r\n    I suggest that you try terminating the driver with a <b>q</b> command; then,\r\n      rerun the program and terminate it with <b>command-c</b>.\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>Using the <b>ics46projects</b> alias (you created in step 1), naviagate\r\n      to the <b>test_all_data_types</b> project folder.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following window should appear on your screen.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/test_all_data_types project.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Double-click the <b>test_all_data_types</b> file to run this program\r\n      in a Terminal window.\r\n    The following Terminal window should appear on your screen.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/TerminalRun.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    You can use all commands except the <b>lf</b> command, which is explained\r\n      below.\r\n    Then terminate the Terminal window.\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li>Find the <b>input files</b> directory in the <b>test_all_data_types</b>\r\n      folder and copy all of its <b>.txt</b> data files up one level in the\r\n      directory (the one that contains the <b>test_all_data_types</b> file).\r\n    <p>\r\n    Then, run the program from a Terminal window\r\n      (connnected to the <b>test_all_data_types</b> directory)\r\n      issue the <b>lf</b> command (load from file); when prompted for the file\r\n      name, just press the enter key to choose the default (<b>loadset.txt</b>).\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following <b>~/ics46projects/test_all_data_types</b>\r\n      Terminal window shows all these actions.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/lf command run.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    Note that because the directory name <b>input files</b> contains a space,\r\n      it appears in double quotes (<b>\"input files\"</b>) in this and most\r\n      Terminal commands.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <b>IMPORTANT</b>: If a program reads data files, the root directory for the\r\n         specifying the files is the directory in which the executable file\r\n         appears.\r\n       It is simplest to copy all the data files into this directory.\r\n       An alternative would be to leave the files in the <b>input files</b>\r\n         directory, and enter their names like <b>input files/loadset.txt</b>\r\n         (note no quotes are needed here: this is not a Terminal command).\r\n      <p>\r\n      When you double-click an executable file to run it (as you did in Step 7)\r\n        it <b>does not</b> run the program in the expected directory; so a\r\n        program run this way cannot correctly read files in that directory!\r\n<p>\r\n\r\n<li>A typical project folder may have more than one <b>.cpp</b> file with a\r\n     main function (as <b>test_all_data_types</b> has).\r\n    Only one of these <b>.cpp</b> files can have its main function uncommented,\r\n      otherwise the build will fail.\r\n    When working on project, it is typical to \r\n    <p>\r\n    <ol type=\"a\">\r\n      <li>Comment-out code in one <b>.cpp</b> file.\r\n      <li>Uncomment code in another <b>.cpp</b> file.\r\n      <li>Rebuild/Rerun the newly uncommented <b>.cpp</b> file.\r\n    </ol>\r\n    <p>\r\n    In the <b>test_all_data_types</b> project folder, the <b>driver.cpp</b>\r\n      file has many main functions: we uncommented one (in step 4) to allow us\r\n      to run the Set driver.\r\n    If more than one main function is uncommented, attempting to build the code\r\n      will result in the compiler specifying a <b>redefinition of 'main'</b>\r\n      error.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The <b>test_all_data_types</b> project folder also contains many <b>.cpp</b>\r\n      files (their names all start with <b>test</b>) that each contain one main\r\n      function (each is a <b>Googletest</b> for one data type).\r\n    If more than one file contains a main function, attempting to build the\r\n      code will result in the linker specifying a\r\n      <b>multiple definition of 'main'</b> error.\r\n    <p>\r\n    To switch this project from running the Set driver to the Set Googletest\r\n    <ol type=\"a\">\r\n      <li>Edit the <b>driver.cpp</b> file and comment-out lines 30-35.\r\n      <li>Edit the <b>test_set.cpp</b> file and uncomment all its lines.<br>\r\n          Most program editors have a special command that allows commenting\r\n          on selected lines to be toggeled.\r\n    </ol>\r\n    <p>\r\n    Rebuild/Rerun the newly uncommented <b>.cpp</b> file.\r\n    <p>\r\n    The following <b>~/ics46projects/test_all_data_types</b>\r\n      Terminal window shows all these actions.\r\n    <p>\r\n    <img src=\"images/commandline/test_set run.png\">\r\n    <p>\r\n    <p>\r\n\r\n<li><b>IMPORTANT:</b>When downloading all other project folders, Mac users must\r\n      remove the following two lines from their <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> files.\r\n<b><pre>set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER \"/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang++\")\r\nset(CMAKE_C_COMPILER \"/cygdrive/c/cygwin64/bin/clang\")</pre></b>\r\n<p>\r\nThese two lines are necessary on PCs to find the Clang C and C++ compilers, but\r\n  they are not necessary on Macs.\r\nI want to supply just one download, and it is easier for Mac users to remove\r\n  these two lines than for PC users to add them.\r\n<p>\r\nFor this document, I provided a link to Mac-compatible <b>CMakeLists.txt</b>\r\n  files, so this operation was unneeded.\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>\r\nWe are now at the end of this handout.\r\nYou will not need to repeat the first two sections during the course, but you\r\n  will frequently download project folders and use them as demonstrated in\r\n  section 2.\r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n\r\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
