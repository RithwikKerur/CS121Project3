The Bill of Rights says that \ncongress shall amend no law that takes away a right from the people \nspecifically stated in  \nthe constitution.  For the government to censor people who use the \ninternet is a direct violation of the Bill of Rights, as is reading \nsomeone's electronic mail(e-mail).  We should have a \nright to do whatever we want as long as it does not inflict harm on any \none else.  Additionally, what is in someone's e-mail directory is their \nbusiness and no one else's.  The government needs to understand that the \nBill of Rights cannot be ignored where the internet is concerned.</P>\n\n<A Name=\"Anchor2\"><B>Issues</B></A>\n\n<P> The internet has a variety of resources located within its realms. \nThere are things like Gopher and the World Wide Web, which are\ndivisions of the Internet that contain even more information.  The Internet \nalso contains \nInternet Relay Chat(IRC), which allows people from all over the world to \n<I>talk</I>  to each other.  There is a lot of information out there and for\nthe government to try to censor some of it is wrong.  That is limiting \nsome of the resources and, when we start limiting our resources, we are \npossibly taking away some valuable information.  Even though the \ngovernment may not feel that the information is valuable, it can still \nhave value if other people feel it does.</P>\n\n <P>There is also the issue of privacy, because, in order \nfor Congress to censor the internet, they will have to have access to \neveryone's account.  This is not censorship but rather and invasion of \nprivacy.  What I keep in my account is my business.  Unless there is \nsome way that what I have in my account can hurt someone, then the \ngovernment has no business reading what is in it.  There is the \nproblem of how the government could find out if there is \nsomething harmful in someone's account.  This issue of privacy recently \ncame up in a case involving a guy who detailed the brutal rape and murder \nof a girl in one of his classes.  He used the girls name and detailed the \nstory on IRC.  Because of this incident, the government wants to have \naccess to all e-mail accounts.  That would not be legal under current \njurisdiction, because, in June, 1967, a joint committee, comprised of \nrepresentatives \nfrom the American Association of University Professors, U. S. \nNational Student Association, Association of American Colleges, \nNational Association of Student Personnel Administrators, and National\nAssociation of Woman Deans and Counselors, met in Washington, \nD.C., and drafted the Joint Statement on Rights and Freedoms of \nStudents<A \nHREF=\"ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/academic/student.freedoms.aaup\">(JSRF)</A>\nThe Joint Statement on Rights and Freedoms of Students \nproves that even if searches by the government were allowed, they \ncould not possibly be very effective if they were done legally.  In \nArticle VI., section B. Investigation of Student Conduct, part 1. of the <A \nHREF=\"ftp://ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/academic/student.freedoms.aaup\">JSRF,</A>  \n it is \nclearly stated that \" Except under extreme emergency circumstances, \npremises occupied by students and the personal possessions\n of students should not be searched unless appropriate authorization\n has been obtained.  Only in extreme cases could searches \nbe done, therefore, there would be very few cases where the government \nwould be obliged to access someone's account.  Someone's e-mail account \nis there personal possession and should fall under the rules and \nguidelines of the Joint Statement of Rights and Students.</P> \n\t\n<A Name=\"Anchor3\"><B>Sites</B></A>\n\n<P>An example of a site that might be considered for censorship is the \n<A HREF=\"http://www.playboy.com/playmates/playmate-mar95.html\">March 1995 \nPlaymate page.</A>  It contains a picture of\n<A HREF= \"http://www.playboy.com/playmates/imx/playmate-mar95.jpg\">Stacey \nSanchez.</A>  If this were just a normal picture, \nthen there probably would not be any problem.  This however is not a \nnormal picture.  Stacey Sanchez is the March 1995 Playboy Playmate of the \nMonth and the picture is a nude photograph of Ms. her.  I understand \nthat many people may consider this pornography and therefore, want to ban \nthe picture and/or the whole <A \nHREF=\"http://www.playboy.com/\">Playboy</A> site itself.  There is \nnothing wrong the naked human body and therefore, nothing wrong with \nhaving access to  a picture of the naked human body.  I understand that \nthis is a personal view, but to say that the picture is pornographic and  \nshould be banned is also exercising personal opinion.  The only \ndifference is that the government is imposing its personal opinion on \nothers.  If the government bans the picture and others like it, such as \nthese nude pictures of \n<A HREF=\"http://www.playboy.com/playmates/imx/playmate-dec94.jpg\">Elisa \nBridges</A> and <A \nHREF=\"http://www.playboy.com/playmates/imx/playmate-feb95.jpg\">Lisa Marie \nScott,</A> it is \nnot giving those who like these kinds of pictures a choice of whether or not \nthey can \nsee the pictures.  Whereas, if the government were to leave the picture \nsite alone, then everyone would have a choice.  People could choose to \neither look at the picture or not.  No one is stopping them from doing \neither.  Also, if the majority of people feel that children should not be \nallowed to look at the pictures, there are steps that can be taken to \nprevent their access.  For instance, at the First Amendment Privacy \nCurtain for Ambers Playhouse<A \nHREF=\"http://www.infohaus.com/access/by-seller/Ambers_Playhouse\">(FAPCAP),</A> the\nuser is asked to enter their age.  This is the equivalent of 900 numbers \nsaying that children under the age of eighteen must get parent permission \nbefore calling or that you must be at least eighteen years of age to \ncall.  Of course, someone under twenty-one could always type in that they \nare twenty-one or older, just as someone under the age of eighteen could \ncall a 900 number without their parent's permission.  To stop \nunauthorized people from calling 900 numbers from their number, Pacific \nBell allows people to put a 900 number block on their phone.  There is no \nsuch \"block\" available on the internet as yet that I have been able to \nlocate, however little kids are not the ones buying the computers in most \ncases and they are also not the ones signing up for e-mail accounts, \neither.  Parents are the ones who control the use of the computers in \ntheir home.  If they do not want their kids to have access to material \nthey deem inappropriate, then there are a few alternatives they have.   \nThe parents can supervise their children when they use the computer, \nthey cannot let their kids know the password to their e-mail accounts, \nor they could lock the keyboard, since almost all computers have a lock \nthat can be engaged when desired.  </P>\n\n<A Name=\"Anchor8\"><B>Benefits</B></A>\n\n<P>The internet offers many benefits to its users.  Each of the various \nsights on the internet or the World Wide Web or Gopher has something to \noffer.  Additionally the sites that someone finds will have links to \nother sites and that site will have links and so on.  The information is \nendless and each day, more information is added.  I am a rap music fan \nand \"Vibe\" is a rap magazine that I like to read.  On the World Wide Web, \nthere is the <A HREF=\"http://www.vibe.com/\"><I>Vibe</I> Magazine \nHomepage.</A>  It has articles on rappers and even has clips of music \nvideos.  This is only one of the many sites on the internet.</P> \n\n<A Name=\"Anchor4\"><B>Agencies</B></A>\t\n\n<P>There are many agencies out there that attempt to prevent \ncensorship and protect people's right to privacy, especially on the \nInternet.  One organization is the Electronic Frontiers Foundation of \nNew Hampshire, <A \nHREF=\"http://www.efnh.org/efnh/efnhinfo.html\">EFF.</A>  The EFF attempts \n\"to ensure protection of freedom of speech and privacy in electronic \ncommunication;  to help policy-makers, the media, and the general public \nunderstand the online world;  and to help the citizens of New Hampshire \ngain access to government information electronically.\"  Organizations \nlike the EFF try to watch out for ordinary internet users who otherwise \nwould not know that the government is trying to take away some of their \nrights.  Without such organizations, we might not have some of the rights \nwe currently enjoy.</P>\n \n<A Name=\"Anchor5\"><B>Conclusion</B></A>\n\n<P>What is located in someone's e-mail file is their personal business. \n It is as personal as a letter that is written.  The government does \nnot have the right to read anyone's mail unless it an extreme \ncircumstance and the same should hold true for an e-mail account.       \nUntil Congress can prove that it is possible for someone to \nbe physically injured by something that they see or hear while using \nthe internet, then I do not see just cause for censorship of the \ninternet.  Too many people in this world rely on the internet for the \ngovernment to censor some of the sites or some of the pictures located on \nthe internet.  There are various avenues that can be taken to prevent the \nunauthorized use of the internet by those people who are underage for \nthat to be an excuse.  The benefits of the internet so far outway any \nminute costs that there is no need for the government to attempt to \ncensor it.   </P> \n\n<A Name=\"Anchor7\"><P><B>References:</B> <OL></A>\n<LI><A HREF=\"ftp:/ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/statements/caf-statement\"> \nftp:/ftp.eff.org/pub/CAF/statements/caf-statement</A><BR>\nThis site clarifies some of the terms that go along with privacy on the internet.
