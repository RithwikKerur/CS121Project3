We define such matching problems in terms of minimizing a directed Hausdorff distance between a pair of such oriented point sets, based on an underlying metric that combines positional distance and angular distance. We present a family of fast approximation algorithms for such oriented point-set pattern matching problems that are based on simple pin-and-query and grid-refinement strategies. Our algorithms achieve an approximation ratio of 1 + &epsilon;, for any fixed constant &epsilon; &gt; 0.\n</p>\n\n\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
