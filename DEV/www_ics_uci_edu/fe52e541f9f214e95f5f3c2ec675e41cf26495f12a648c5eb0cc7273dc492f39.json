Bender, Jeremy T. Fineman, and Seth Gilbert, appeared in SODA '09.</h2>\n<h2> Presented by Darren Strash, UC Irvine </h2>\n\n\n<p>\nConsider the following problem: We begin with a graph consisting of n \nnodes and zero edges. An adversary adds m edges to the graph, one \nedge at a time. Throughout this process, we would like to maintain \na topological ordering of the graph. I will discuss a recent paper \nwhich presents a new algorithm that has a total running time of \nO(n2 log n) for maintaining the topological ordering throughout \nall the edge insertions. \n</body>\n</html>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
