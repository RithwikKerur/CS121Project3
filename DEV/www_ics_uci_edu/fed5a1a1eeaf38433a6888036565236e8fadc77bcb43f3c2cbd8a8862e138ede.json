There are also connections with\n<A HREF=\"carto.html\">geographic information systems</A> relating\nto problems of surveying or otherwise measuring large areas of land.\n\n<P>One type of problem of particular interest in\n<A HREF=\"cam.html\">manufacturing</A> is determining\nfrom a sequence of measurements the tolerance of a part;\nthat is, its departure from the Platonic ideal form of its design.\nThere has been some related work in the computational geometry community,\non problems such as constructing the minimum width annulus containing the\nboundary of an input figure (a measure of its roundness) however there\nhas been little systematic treatment of such problems.\nChee Yap recently spoke on this subject at the 5th MSI\nWorksh. on Computational Geometry; his talk pointed out the possibility\nof designing algorithms\nthat take advantage of some known structure in a sequence of measurements,\nand of coupling measurement and computation in an adaptive probing algorithm.\n<P><UL>\n<li><a href=\"ftp://ams.sunysb.edu/pub/geometry/msi-workshop/95/yap.ps.gz\">Aspects of Dimensional Tolerancing</a>,\nChee Yap, 5th MSI Worksh.
