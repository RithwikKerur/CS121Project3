Most of the research has concentrated on the\nfinite element or boundary element part of the problem. Little\neffort has been applied to integrating design optimization with\nCAD.</p>\n\n<p>With the introduction of parametric and variational CAD, it is\nmore desirable than ever to merge these technologies, i.e., to\nperform the analysis directly on the CAD geometry and to use the\nCAD parameters/dimensions as design variables. In this talk, one\npart of the problem is examined, the calculation of geometric\nsensitivities on variational CAD geometry. It is shown that for a\nwell-conditioned set of constraint equations, the geometric\nsensitivities are easily obtained by a straight-forward application\nof the implicit function theorem.</p>\n\n<p>When the constraint equations become singular, the situation is\nmore complex. The nature of singularities is explored, and a\nmethod, based on rational transformations that are common in\nalgebraic curve tracing, is suggested to resolve singular points.\nIt is shown that the geometric sensitivity is a natural by-product\nof the transformation. The talk concludes with an overview of a\nsymbolic algebra package, coded in Mathematica, that was found to\nbe useful in the investigation.</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
