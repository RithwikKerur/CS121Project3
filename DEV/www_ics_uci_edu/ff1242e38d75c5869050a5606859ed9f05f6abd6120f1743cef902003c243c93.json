This detail comes from his 1904 US Passport Application and 1932 Death Certificate, both in his hometown of Lorain, OH. He married Bertha Neumann on 30 Jun 1899 in Cuyahoga County, Ohio and they had three known children. Nothing is known about Michael's siblings or how he connects to the overall Langsam tree, but there are two hints. Sailing aboard the Pretoria out of the port of Hamburg was a Feige Langsam, age 18, from Stroze, Poland (which is 3.5 miles from Grybow). She arrived in NYC on 1 December 1906 and listed her final destination as her uncle Mechele Langsam in Lorain, OH. No other detail can be found about her (the recorded age of 18 makes it unlikely that she was actually Fannie, the daughter of Michael, rather than his niece). The second hint also comes from the town of Stroze, Poland. Jacob Aron Langsam left Bremen, Germany and arrived at Ellis Island aboard the Main on 29 May 1906. He also come from Stroze, was married and 42 years old. His occupation was dealer and his final destination was a brother, Moche Langsam living at 46 Bayard, Brooklyn NY. The Brooklyn City directories list a Morris Langsam in 1906 at 144 Bayard, Brooklyn. In the 1905 NY Census Morris Langsam, age 36, b. Hungary was living at 142 Bayard St. His family is listed on Bayard in 1910 as well. This Morris Langsam family is listed as <a href=\"mrrs-h58.htm\">H58</a> in the Langsam-Spira Book. No other reference to Jacob Aron Langsam is found in US vital records. Perhaps the grandparent of Morris/Jacob Aron was a sibling to Leopold (father of Michael). \r\n</TD></TR></TABLE><P>\r\n<UL><LI><font size=\"+1\"><B>Fannie</B></FONT> (23 Jun 1890 - 4 Dec 1969) was born in Lorain, Ohio.
