But if the SCM system is the backend of\n&gt; a version-aware web server, with the actual work happening in \"stateless\"\n&gt; web clients, then that context must be represented by a cookie.\n&gt; \n&gt; The cookie belongs to the underlying SCM system; whether it is an MD5\n&gt; hash of the document contents, some cryptic string churned up from bowels\n&gt; of the SCM database, or \"allworkandnoplaymakesjohnnyadullboy\" is not\n&gt; HTTP's or a Web authoring tool's business.  They just have to keep it\n&gt; associated with the checked-out document so that it can be reunited with\n&gt; the checkout context at checkin time.\n&gt; \n&gt; This cookie is the single most important component of distributed web\n&gt; authoring, IMHO.\n\nHmmm, are you using the general computer meaning of \"cookie\", or\nspecifically the Cookie and Set-Cookie mechanisms?  The reason I ask\nis that the Content-Version and Derived-From fields in earlier\nHTTP drafts were intended to carry that information for versioned\nresources, and there is no reason why this group cannot complete\ntheir definition for HTTP/1.2 (in fact, that is what I am hoping).\n\nI suppose that Cookie/Set-Cookie could be used, but there are a variety\nof concerns (like which cookie, what is its realm, how do you deal with\nnormal cookie control for privacy, etc.) which would need to be addressed.\n\n\n ...Roy T.
