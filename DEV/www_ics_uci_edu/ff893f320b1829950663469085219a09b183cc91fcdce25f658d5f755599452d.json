For example, (n,m)=(2,3) yields a \ntriangular prism. Note that there are nm vertices of this figure, yet in \nthe most symmetric case there are only 2 distances between the vertices. \n\nIf there are p points in the plane, n above, and m below, then the result \nis the p-times iterated cone over the product of n-point and m-point \nsimplices. For example, when (p,n,m) = (1,2,2), the result is a \nsquare-based pyramid; when (p,n,m) = (2,2,2), the result is a hyper \npyramid whose base is a square-based pyramid. This even makes sense when \none or more of p, n, and m equal 0.\n\nThe proofs are straightforward, so I hope I did them correctly: First, \nnote that the combinatorial type is determined by p, n, and m. Second, \nuse the coordinatization of an k-point simplex as nonnegative real \nordered k-tuples which sum to 1. For the p=0 case, it suffices to \nconsider the plane defined by setting the sum of the first n coordinates \nto 1/2; this is also implies that the sum of the last m coordinates is \n1/2, hence the intersection is the Cartesian product of 1/2-size n-point \nand m-point simplices. The case of p&gt;0 is similar.\n\nThis is a really neat problem. I'll have to think about the higher\nco-dimension cases and cubes, cross-polytopes, and hemi-cubes instead of\nsimplices. I'll also post to the Geometry Forum's geometry.puzzles,\ngeometry.college, and/or goemetry.research\n(<A HREF=\"http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/HTMLthreads/index.html\">http://forum.swarthmore.edu/~sarah/HTMLthreads/index.html</A>), but I don't\nsee how to link those to posts to sci.math. \n\nDouglas Zare\n<A HREF=\"http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~zare\">http://www.cco.caltech.edu/~zare</A>\n</PRE>\n", "encoding": "ascii"}
