This algorithm is one part of the larger problem of\nsimulating protein aggregation such as occurs in Alzheimer's,\nHuntington's and other neurodegenerative diseases. We briefly\npresent the problem context, including the medical need and an\noverview of the protein folding and aggregation problems, and then\nconcentrate on the enumeration algorithm. This algorithm is shown\nto be O(|L|^4 |a||b|^2), where L is the dimension of the lattice,\n|a| is the length of the peptide that is held fixed during the\nenumeration and |b| is the length of the peptide whose position and\norientation are varied. After presenting the basic algorithm, we\ngive several improvements suggested by the author for reducing time\nand/or space, making use of, among other things, multi-dimensional\nhash tables. The talk concludes with speculation on further\nimprovements of the enumeration algorithm as integrated into the\nprotein aggregation problem.</p>\n\n<p>(Based on S. Istrail, R. Schwartz, and J.
