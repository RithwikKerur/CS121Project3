Ekbia and Bonnie A. Nardi<br />\n2017</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nThe computerization of the economy\u2014and everyday life\u2014has transformed the division of labor between humans and machines, shifting many people into work that is hidden, poorly compensated, or accepted as part of being a \u201cuser\u201d of digital technology. Through our clicks and swipes, logins and profiles, emails and posts, we are, more or less willingly, participating in digital activities that yield economic value to others but little or no return to us. Hamid Ekbia and Bonnie Nardi call this kind of participation\u2014the extraction of economic value from low-cost or free labor in computer-mediated networks\u2014\u201cheteromation.\u201d In this book, they explore the social and technological processes through which economic value is extracted from digitally mediated work, the nature of the value created, and what prompts people to participate in the process.<br />\nArguing that heteromation is a new logic of capital accumulation, Ekbia and Nardi consider different kinds of heteromated labor: communicative labor, seen in user-generated content on social media; cognitive labor, including microwork and self-service; creative labor, from gaming environments to literary productions; emotional labor, often hidden within paid jobs; and organizing labor, made up of collaborative groups such as citizen scientists. Ekbia and Nardi then offer a utopian vision: heteromation refigured to bring end users more fully into the prosperity of capitalism.<br />\n</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/stuff-bits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4932 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/collidbooks_covers_0isbn9780262036207type-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/collidbooks_covers_0isbn9780262036207type-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/collidbooks_covers_0isbn9780262036207type.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">The Stuff of Bits</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Paul Dourish<br />\n2017</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nVirtual entities that populate our digital experience, like e-books, virtual worlds, and online stores, are backed by the large-scale physical infrastructures of server farms, fiber optic cables, power plants, and microwave links. But another domain of material constraints also shapes digital living: the digital representations sketched on whiteboards, encoded into software, stored in databases, loaded into computer memory, and transmitted on networks. These digital representations encode aspects of our everyday world and make them available for digital processing. The limits and capacities of those representations carry significant consequences for digital society.</p>\n<p>In The Stuff of Bits, Paul Dourish examines the specific materialities that certain digital objects exhibit. He presents four case studies: emulation, the creation of a \u201cvirtual\u201d computer inside another; digital spreadsheets and their role in organizational practice; relational databases and the issue of \u201cthe databaseable\u201d; and the evolution of digital networking and the representational entailments of network protocols.

In her work, Star highlighted the messy practices of discovering science, asking hard questions about the marginalizing as well as the liberating powers of science and technology. In the landmark work Sorting Things Out, Star and Geoffrey Bowker revealed the social and ethical histories that are deeply embedded in classification systems. Star\u2019s most celebrated concept was the notion of boundary objects: representational forms\u2014things or theories\u2014that can be shared between different communities, with each holding its own understanding of the representation.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Leigh was unable to complete a work on the poetics of infrastructure that further developed the full range of her work. This volume collects articles by Star that set out some of her thinking on boundary objects, marginality, and infrastructure, together with essays by friends and colleagues from a range of disciplines\u2014from philosophy of science to organization science\u2014that testify to the wide-ranging influence of Star\u2019s work.<br />\n</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Participatory-Culture-Networked-Era-Conversation/dp/0745660711\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1261\" src=\"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/618j5wKf5jL._SX325_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" alt=\"Participatory Culture in a Networked Era: A Conversation on Youth, Learning, Commerce, and Politics\" width=\"212\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Participatory Culture in a Networked Era: A Conversation on Youth, Learning, Commerce, and Politics </p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">by Henry Jenkins, Mizuko Ito, danah boyd<br />\n2015</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nIn the last two decades, both the conception and the practice of participatory culture have been transformed by the new affordances enabled by digital, networked, and mobile technologies.

The consequence of having so many choices is that they compete for our attention: we continually switch our attention between different types of information while doing different types of tasks; in other words, we multitask. The activity of information workers in particular is characterized by the continual switching of attention throughout the day. In this book, empirical work is presented, based on ethnographic and sensor data collection, which reveals how multitasking affects information workers&#8217; activities, mood, and stress in real work environments. Multitasking is discussed from various perspectives: activity switching, interruptions as triggers for activity switching, email as a major source of interruptions, and the converse of distractions: focused attention. All of these factors are components of information work. This book begins by defining multitasking and describing different research approaches used in studying multitasking. It then describes how multiple factors occur to encourage multitasking in the digitally-enabled workplace: the abundance and ease of accessing information, the number of different working spheres, the workplace environment, attentional state, habit, and social norms. Empirical work is presented describing the nature of multitasking, the relationship of different types of interruptions and email with overload and stress, and patterns of attention focus. The final chapter ties these factors together and discusses challenges that information workers in our digital age face.<br />\n</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/collidbooks_covers_0isbn9780262027823type.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4936 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/collidbooks_covers_0isbn9780262027823type-253x300.jpg\" alt=\"The Interconnections Collection\" width=\"253\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/collidbooks_covers_0isbn9780262027823type-253x300.jpg 253w, https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/collidbooks_covers_0isbn9780262027823type.jpg 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 253px) 100vw, 253px\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">The Interconnections Collection:<br />\n&#8211;Short Circuits.

Of particular interest is the rise of what have come to be known as \u201cvirtual worlds\u201d: persistent graphical environments populated (and often partially authored) by large communities of individual users. Interactors in these worlds are embodied as avatars: digital puppets or representations through which the user exerts his or her will on the environment. It is this virtual embodiment that makes today\u2019s virtual worlds so interesting. With virtual embodiment comes a host of new and important communicative possibilities, and an assortment of new challenges and literacies including a wide range of nonverbal communication behaviors and non-linguistic social signaling options.</p>\n<p>In this book, we begin the work of articulating the challenges and possibilities for non-verbal communication in virtual worlds.

The intention is to give readers a comprehensive background in order to understand what has been done and what promises and challenges lie ahead. By providing a classification scheme and general review, this book can also help technology designers and researchers better understand what technologies have been successful, what problems remain open, and where innovations can further address challenges and opportunities for individuals with autism and the variety of stakeholders connected to them.<br />\n</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Adaptive-Hypertext-Hypermedia-Peter-Brusilovski/dp/9048149444/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426521179&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=Adaptive+Hypertext+and+Hypermedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1994\" src=\"//www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/Kobsa-AdaptiveHypertextandHypermedia.jpg\" alt=\"Kobsa-AdaptiveHypertextandHypermedia\" width=\"331\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/Kobsa-AdaptiveHypertextandHypermedia.jpg 331w, https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/Kobsa-AdaptiveHypertextandHypermedia-199x300.jpg 199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Adaptive Hypertext and Hypermedia</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Peter Brusilovski\u00a0(Editor), Alfred Kobsa (Editor), Julita Vassileva (Editor)<br />\n2013</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nHypertext/hypermedia systems and user-model-based adaptive systems in the areas of learning and information retrieval have for a long time been considered as two mutually exclusive approaches to information access. Adaptive systems tailor information to the user and may guide the user in the information space to present the most relevant material, taking into account a model of the user&#8217;s goals, interests and preferences. Hypermedia systems, on the other hand, are `user neutral&#8217;: they provide the user with the tools and the freedom to explore an information space by browsing through a complex network of information nodes. Adaptive hypertext and hypermedia systems attempt to bridge the gap between these two approaches.</p>\n<p>Adaptation of hypermedia systems to each individual user is increasingly needed. With the growing size, complexity and heterogeneity of current hypermedia systems, such as the World Wide Web, it becomes virtually impossible to impose guidelines on authors concerning the overall organization of hypermedia information. The networks therefore become so complex and unstructured that the existing navigational tools are no longer powerful enough to provide orientation on where to search for the needed information. It is also not possible to identify appropriate pre-defined paths or subnets for users with certain goals and knowledge backgrounds since the user community of hypermedia systems is usually quite inhomogeneous. This is particularly true for Web-based applications which are expected to be used by a much greater variety of users than any earlier standalone application.</p>\n<p>A possible remedy for the negative effects of the traditional `one-size-fits-all&#8217; approach in the development of hypermedia systems is to equip them with the ability\u00a0to adapt to the needs of the individual users.\u00a0A possible way of achieving adaptivity is by modeling the users and tailoring the system&#8217;s interactions to their goals, tasks and interests. In this sense, the notion of adaptive hypertext/hypermedia comes naturally to denote a\u00a0hypertext or\u00a0hypermedia system, which reflects some features of the user and/or\u00a0characteristics of his system usage in a user model, and utilizes this\u00a0model in order to adapt various behavioral aspects of the system to\u00a0the user.</p>\n<p>This book is the first comprehensive publication on adaptive hypertext and hypermedia. It is oriented towards researchers and practitioners in the fields of hypertext and hypermedia, information systems, and personalized systems. It is also an important resource for the numerous developers of Web-based applications. The design decisions, adaptation methods, and experience presented in this book are a unique source of ideas and techniques for developing more usable and more intelligent Web-based systems suitable for a great variety of users. The practitioners will find it important that many of the adaptation techniques presented in this book have proved to be efficient and are ready to be used in various applications.<br />\n</p>\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Games-Learning-Society-Computational-Perspectives/dp/0521144523\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51aJc5%2BUjlL._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" width=\"250\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Games, Learning, and Society: Learning and Meaning in the Digital Age</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Edited by Constance Steinkuehler,\u200e Kurt Squire,\u200e Sasha Barab<br />\n2012</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nThis volume is the first reader on videogames and learning of its kind.

Leonardi, Bonnie A. Nardi, Jannis Kallinikos<br />\n2012</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nAsk a person on the street whether new technologies bring about important social change and you are likely to hear a resounding &#8220;yes.&#8221; But the answer is less definitive amongst academics who study technology and social practice. Scholarly writing has been heavily influenced by the ideology of technological determinism &#8211; the belief that some types or technologically driven social changes are inevitable and cannot be stopped. Rather than argue for or against notions of determinism, the authors in this book ask how the materiality (the arrangement of physical, digital, or rhetorical materials into particular forms that endure across differences in place and time) of technologies, ranging from computer-simulation tools and social media, to ranking devices and rumors, is actually implicated in the process of formal and informal organizing. The book builds a new theoretical framework to consider the important socio-technical changes confronting people&#8217;s everyday experiences in and outside of work. Leading scholars in the field contribute original chapters examining the complex interactions between technology and the social, between artifact and humans. The discussion spans multiple disciplines, including management, information systems, informatics, communication, sociology, and the history of technology, and opens up a new area of research regarding the relationship between materiality and organizing.<br />\n\u201cMateriality and Organizing marks a long overdue turning point in the scholarly study of the human-technology relationship that now engulfs our lives. For too long, researchers have tended to treat technology as a dream conjured by agents and imbued with their projects. This brilliant sequence of essays restores and deepens the entire field of perception. It finally returns us to the facticity of technology as it persistently redefines the horizon of the possible. These tightly argued masterpieces reestablish technology as embodied and significant. Most importantly, they return us to materiality just in time. With each passing day, technology becomes both more abstracted from its physical manifestations and more ubiquitous, producing a dematerialized materiality. Only a relentless focus on this paradox will yield the intellectual tools that are required to participate in our own destinies.\u201d<br />\n-Shoshana Zuboff, Charles Edward Wilson Professor, Harvard Business School<br />\n\u201cThis volume is a much-needed exploration of the material aspects of the technologies that have reshaped our world. For two decades, a narrative framing technologies as social constructions has led to important advances in our understanding of their nature and impacts. Materiality and Organizing provides an important counterbalance to this approach in its exploration of the dimensions of materiality that constrain but also enable technologies to connect with and affect people, organizations, and society. This volume is required reading for scholars interested in technology, its development, and its impacts. Its insights into information technology are particularly significant.\u201d<br />\n-Professor Marshall Scott Poole, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign<br />\n\u201cFor too long the materiality of social life has been ignored by sociologists and organization studies scholars. The role of materiality in social life is turning out to be one of the most interesting and difficult issues in the field. This multidisciplinary collection does not offer a single solution but offers the latest thoughts of scholars who try and take materiality seriously in their own research. The resulting volume is a deep and fascinating collection of essays.\u201d<br />\n-Professor Trevor Pinch, Cornell University<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Video-Games-Learning-Participatory-Education-Connections/dp/0807751987\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Wu4mGoZbL._SX385_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg\" width=\"250\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Video Games and Learning: Teaching and Participatory Culture in the Digital Age (Technology, Education&#8211;Connections)</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Kurt Squire<br />\n2011</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nCan we learn socially and academically valuable concepts and skills from video games?

The designers of Quest to Learn developed an approach to learning that draws from what games do best: drop kids into inquiry-based, complex problem spaces that are built to help players understand how they are doing, what they need to work on, and where to go next. Content is not treated as dry information but as a living resource; students are encouraged to interact with the larger world in ways that feel relevant, exciting, and empowering. Quest to Learn opened in the fall of 2009 with 76 sixth graders. In their first semester, these students learned\u2014among other things\u2014to convert fractions into decimals in order to break a piece of code found in a library book; to use atlases and read maps to create a location guide for a reality television series; and to create video tutorials for a hapless group of fictional inventors.

The resulting volume is divided into four parts, preceded by a general editorial chapter providing a more detailed review of the domain of collaborative software engineering. Part 1 is on &#8220;Characterizing Collaborative Software Engineering&#8221;, Part 2 examines various &#8220;Tools and Techniques&#8221;, Part 3 addresses organizational issues, and finally Part 4 contains four examples of &#8220;Emerging Issues in Collaborative Software Engineering&#8221;.<br />\nAs a result, this book delivers a comprehensive state-of-the-art overview and empirical results for researchers in academia and industry in areas like software process management, empirical software engineering, and global software development. Practitioners working in this area will also appreciate the detailed descriptions and reports, which can often be used as guidelines to improve their daily work.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hanging-out-messing-around-and-geeking-out\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/Hanging-out-Messing-Around-and-Geeking-Out-Kids-Living-and-Learning-with-New-Media-Mizuko-Ito.jpg\" alt=\"book1\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out: Kids Living and Learning with New Media</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Mizuko Ito<br />\n2010</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nConventional wisdom about young people&#8217;s use of digital technology often equates generational identity with technology identity: today&#8217;s teens seem constantly plugged in to video games, social networks sites, and text messaging. Yet there is little actual research that investigates the intricate dynamics of youth&#8217;s social and recreational use of digital media. Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out fills this gap, reporting on an ambitious three-year ethnographic investigation into how young people are living and learning with new media in varied settings\u2014at home, in after school programs, and in online spaces. By focusing on media practices in the everyday contexts of family and peer interaction, the book views the relationship of youth and new media not simply in terms of technology trends but situated within the broader structural conditions of childhood and the negotiations with adults that frame the experience of youth in the United States.</p>\n<p>Integrating twenty-three different case studies\u2014which include Harry Potter podcasting, video-game playing, music-sharing, and online romantic breakups\u2014in a unique collaborative authorship style, Hanging Out, Messing Around, and Geeking Out is distinctive for its combination of in-depth description of specific group dynamics with conceptual analysis.</p>\n<p>This book was written as a collaborative effort by members of the Digital Youth Project, a three-year research effort funded by the John D. and Catherine T.

It&#8217;s a massively multiplayer online game, or MMO in gamer jargon, where each person controls a single character inside a virtual world, interacting with other people&#8217;s characters and computer-controlled monsters, quest-givers, and merchants.</p>\n<p>In My Life as a Night Elf Priest, Bonnie Nardi, a well-known ethnographer who has published extensively on how theories of what we do intersect with how we adopt and use technology, compiles more than three years of participatory research in Warcraft play and culture in the United States and China into this field study of player behavior and activity. She introduces us to her research strategy and the history, structure, and culture of Warcraft; argues for applying activity theory and theories of aesthetic experience to the study of gaming and play; and educates us on issues of gender, culture, and addiction as part of the play experience. Nardi paints a compelling portrait of what drives online gamers both in this country and in China, where she spent a month studying players in Internet cafes.</p>\n<p>Bonnie Nardi has given us a fresh look not only at World of Warcraft but at the field of game studies as a whole.

We envy children&#8217;s natural affinity for computers, the ease with which they click in and out of digital worlds. Thirty years ago, however, the computer belonged almost exclusively to business, the military, and academia. In Engineering Play, Mizuko Ito describes the transformation of the computer from a tool associated with adults and work to one linked to children, learning, and play. Ito gives an account of a pivotal period in the 1980s and 1990s, which saw the rise of a new category of consumer software designed specifically for elementary school aged children. &#8220;Edutainment&#8221; software sought to blend various educational philosophies with interactive gaming and entertainment, and included such titles as Number Munchers, Oregon Trail, KidPix, and Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?.</p>\n<p>Drawing from observations of kids&#8217; play, interviews with software developers, and advertising and industry materials, Ito identifies three educational philosophies and genres in children&#8217;s software that connect players in software production, distribution, and consumption: instruction, focused on transmission of academic content; exploration, tied to open-ended play; and construction, aimed at empowering young users to create and manipulate digital media.</p>\n<p>The children&#8217;s software boom (and the bust that followed), says Ito, can be seen as a microcosm of the negotiations surrounding new technology, children, and education. The story she tells is both a testimonial to the transformative power of innovation and a cautionary tale about its limitations.</p>\n<p>John D. and Catherine T.

Historically, scientific collaborations were carried out by scientists in the same physical location\u2014the Manhattan Project of the 1940s, for example, involved thousands of scientists gathered on a remote plateau in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Today, information and communication technologies allow cooperation among scientists from far-flung institutions and different disciplines. Scientific Collaboration on the Internet provides both broad and in-depth views of how new technology is enabling novel kinds of science and engineering collaboration. The book offers commentary from notable experts in the field along with case studies of large-scale collaborative projects, past and ongoing.</p>\n<p>The projects described range from the development of a national virtual observatory for astronomical research to a National Institutes of Health funding program for major multilaboratory medical research; from the deployment of a cyberinfrastructure to connect experts in earthquake engineering to partnerships between developed and developing countries in AIDS research. The chapter authors speak frankly about the problems these projects encountered as well as the successes they achieved. The book strikes a useful balance between presenting the real stories of collaborations and developing a scientific approach to conceiving, designing, implementing, and evaluating such projects. It points to a future of scientific collaborations that build successfully on aspects from multiple disciplines.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.springer.com/computer/database+management+%26+information+retrieval/book/978-3-540-72078-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/The-Adaptive-Web-Methods-and-Strategies-of-Web-Personalization-Alfred-Kobsa.jpg\" alt=\"book1\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">The Adaptive Web: Methods and Strategies of Web Personalization</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Edited by Peter Brusilovski, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl<br />\n2007</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nWeb personalization has evolved into a large research field that attracts scientists from different communities such as hypertext, user modeling, machine learning, natural language generation, information retrieval, intelligent tutoring systems, cognitive science, and Web-based education.

A companion work to Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman&#8217;s textbook Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals, The Game Design Reader is a classroom sourcebook, a reference for working game developers, and a great read for game fans and players.</p>\n<p>Thirty-two essays by game designers, game critics, game fans, philosophers, anthropologists, media theorists, and others consider fundamental questions: What are games and how are they designed? How do games interact with culture at large? What critical approaches can game designers take to create game stories, game spaces, game communities, and new forms of play?</p>\n<p>Salen and Zimmerman have collected seminal writings that span 50 years to offer a stunning array of perspectives. Game journalists express the rhythms of game play, sociologists tackle topics such as role-playing in vast virtual worlds, players rant and rave, and game designers describe the sweat and tears of bringing a game to market. Each text acts as a springboard for discussion, a potential class assignment, and a source of inspiration. The book is organized around fourteen topics, from The Player Experience to The Game Design Process, from Games and Narrative to Cultural Representation. Each topic, introduced with a short essay by Salen and Zimmerman, covers ideas and research fundamental to the study of games, and points to relevant texts within the Reader. Visual essays between book sections act as counterpoint to the writings.</p>\n<p>Like Rules of Play, The Game Design Reader is an intelligent and playful book. An invaluable resource for professionals and a unique introduction for those new to the field, The Game Design Reader is essential reading for anyone who takes games seriously.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Memory-Practices-Sciences-Inside-Technology/dp/0262524899\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/Memory-Practices-in-the-Sciences-Geoffrey-Bowker.jpg\" alt=\"book1\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Memory Practices in the Sciences</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Geoffrey C. Bowker<br />\n2005</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nThe way we record knowledge, and the web of technical, formal, and social practices that surrounds it, inevitably affects the knowledge that we record. The ways we hold knowledge about the past &#8212; in handwritten manuscripts, in printed books, in file folders, in databases &#8212; shape the kind of stories we tell about that past. In this lively and erudite look at the relation of our information infrastructures to our information, Geoffrey Bowker examines how, over the past two hundred years, information technology has converged with the nature and production of scientific knowledge. His story weaves a path between the social and political work of creating an explicit, indexical memory for science &#8212; the making of infrastructures &#8212; and the variety of ways we continually reconfigure, lose, and regain the past. At a time when memory is so cheap and its recording is so protean, Bowker reminds us of the centrality of what and how we choose to forget. In Memory Practices in the Sciences he looks at three &#8220;memory epochs&#8221; of the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries and their particular reconstructions and reconfigurations of scientific knowledge. The nineteenth century&#8217;s central science, geology, mapped both the social and the natural world into a single time package (despite apparent discontinuities), as, in a different way, did mid-twentieth-century cybernetics. Both, Bowker argues, packaged time in ways indexed by their information technologies to permit traffic between the social and natural worlds. Today&#8217;s sciences of biodiversity, meanwhile, &#8220;database the world&#8221; in a way that excludes certain spaces, entities, and times. We use the tools of the present to look at the past, says Bowker; we project onto nature our modes of organizing our own affairs.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/personal-portable-pedestrian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/Personal-Portable-Pedestrian-Mobile-Phones-in-Japanese-Life-Mizuko-Ito.jpg\" alt=\"book1\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Personal, Portable, Pedestrian: Mobile Phones in Japanese Life</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Edited by Mizuko Ito, Misa Matsuda, Daisuke Okabe<br />\n2005</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nThe Japanese term for mobile phone, keitai (roughly translated as &#8220;something you carry with you&#8221;), evokes not technical capability or freedom of movement but intimacy and portability, defining a personal accessory that allows constant social connection. Japan&#8217;s enthusiastic engagement with mobile technology has become\u2014along with anime, manga, and sushi\u2014part of its trendsetting popular culture. Personal, Portable, Pedestrian, the first book-length English-language treatment of mobile communication use in Japan, covers the transformation of keitai from business tool to personal device for communication and play.</p>\n<p>The essays in this groundbreaking collection document the emergence, incorporation, and domestication of mobile communications in a wide range of social practices and institutions. The book first considers the social, cultural, and historical context of keitai development, including its beginnings in youth pager use in the early 1990s. It then discusses the virtually seamless integration of keitai use into everyday life, contrasting it to the more escapist character of Internet use on the PC. Other essays suggest that the use of mobile communication reinforces ties between close friends and family, producing &#8220;tele-cocooning&#8221; by tight-knit social groups. The book also discusses mobile phone manners and examines keitai use by copier technicians, multitasking housewives, and school children.

In Rules of Play Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman present a much-needed primer for this emerging field. They offer a unified model for looking at all kinds of games, from board games and sports to computer and video games. As active participants in game culture, the authors have written Rules of Play as a catalyst for innovation, filled with new concepts, strategies, and methodologies for creating and understanding games. Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like &#8220;play,&#8221; &#8220;design,&#8221; and &#8220;interactivity.&#8221; They look at games through a series of eighteen &#8220;game design schemas,&#8221; or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance.</p>\n<p>Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide.

Yet it is also a philosophical enterprise in the way it represents the world and creates and manipulates models of reality, people, and action. In this book, Paul Dourish addresses the philosophical bases of human-computer interaction. He looks at how what he calls &#8220;embodied interaction&#8221; &#8212; an approach to interacting with software systems that emphasizes skilled, engaged practice rather than disembodied rationality &#8212; reflects the phenomenological approaches of Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and other twentieth-century philosophers. The phenomenological tradition emphasizes the primacy of natural practice over abstract cognition in everyday activity. Dourish shows how this perspective can shed light on the foundational underpinnings of current research on embodied interaction. He looks in particular at how tangible and social approaches to interaction are related, how they can be used to analyze and understand embodied interaction, and how they could affect the design of future interactive systems.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Coordination-Theory-Collaboration-Technology-Olson/dp/0415647029\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/Coordination-Theory-and-Collaboration-Technology-Gary-Olson.jpg\" alt=\"Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Coordination Theory and Collaboration Technology</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Edited by Gary M.

All are examples of classification &#8212; the scaffolding of information infrastructures.</p>\n<p>In Sorting Things Out, Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star explore the role of categories and standards in shaping the modern world. In a clear and lively style, they investigate a variety of classification systems, including the International Classification of Diseases, the Nursing Interventions Classification, race classification under apartheid in South Africa, and the classification of viruses and of tuberculosis.</p>\n<p>The authors emphasize the role of invisibility in the process by which classification orders human interaction. They examine how categories are made and kept invisible, and how people can change this invisibility when necessary. They also explore systems of classification as part of the built information environment. Much as an urban historian would review highway permits and zoning decisions to tell a city&#8217;s story, the authors review archives of classification design to understand how decisions have been made. Sorting Things Out has a moral agenda, for each standard and category valorizes some point of view and silences another. Standards and classifications produce advantage or suffering. Jobs are made and lost; some regions benefit at the expense of others. How these choices are made and how we think about that process are at the moral and political core of this work.

The research described in Context and Consciousness presents activity theory as a means of structuring and guiding field studies of human-computer interaction, from practical design to theoretical development. Activity theory is a psychological theory with a naturalistic emphasis, with roots going back to the 1920s in the Soviet Union. It provides a hierarchical framework for describing activity and a set of perspectives on practice. Activity theory has been fruitfully applied in many areas of human need, including problems of mentally and physically handicapped children, educational testing, curriculum design, and ergonomics. There is growing interest in applying activity theory to problems of human- computer interaction, and an international community of researchers is contributing to the effort.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Science-Run-Information-Management-Schlumberger/dp/B005Q73J2I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/Science-on-the-Run-Geoffrey-Bowker.jpg\" alt=\"book1\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Science on the Run: Information Management and Industrial Geophysics at Schlumberger, 1920-1940</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Geoffrey C. Bowker<br />\n1994</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nThis is the story of how one company created and codified a new science &#8220;on the run,&#8221; away from the confines of the laboratory. By construing its service as scientific, Schlumberger was able to get the edge on the competition and construct an enviable niche for itself in a fast-growing industry. In this engaging account, Geoffrey Bowker reveals how Schlumberger devised a method of testing potential oil fields, produced a rhetoric, and secured a position that allowed it to manipulate the definition of what a technology is. Bowker calls the heart of the story &#8220;The Two Measurements That Worked,&#8221; and he renders it in the style of a myth. In so doing, he shows seamlessly how society becomes embedded even in that most basic and seemingly value-independent of scientific concepts: the measurement. Bowker describes the origins and peregrinations of Schlumberger, details the ways in which the science developed in the field was translated into a form that could be defended in a patent court, and analyzes the company&#8217;s strategies within the broader context of industrial science.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/small-matter-programming\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-619\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/A-SMALL-Matter-of-Programming-Bonnie-Nardi.jpg\" alt=\"A SMALL Matter of Programming-Bonnie Nardi\" width=\"220\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/A-SMALL-Matter-of-Programming-Bonnie-Nardi.jpg 220w, https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/A-SMALL-Matter-of-Programming-Bonnie-Nardi-201x300.jpg 201w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 220px) 100vw, 220px\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">A Small Matter of Programming: Perspectives on End User Computing</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Bonnie A. Nardi<br />\n1993</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">A Small Matter of Programming asks why it has been so difficult for end users to command programming power and explores the problems of end user-driven application development that must be solved to afford end users greater computational power.<br />\nDrawing on empirical research on existing end user systems, A Small Matter of Programming analyzes cognitive, social, and technical issues of end user programming. In particular, it examines the importance of task-specific programming languages, visual application frameworks, and collaborative work practices for end user computing, with the goal of helping designers and programmers understand and better satisfy the needs of end users who want the capability to create, customize, and extend their applications software.<br />\nThe ideas in the book are based on the author&#8217;s research on two successful end user programming systems\u2014spreadsheets and CAD systems\u2014as well as other empirical research. Nardi concentrates on broad issues in end user programming, especially end users&#8217; strengths and problems, introducing tools and techniques as they are related to higher-level user issues.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Systems-Symbolic-Computation-Artificial-Intelligence/dp/3540183809\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/Symbolic-Comutation-Alfred-Kobsa.jpg\" alt=\"book1\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">User Models in Dialog Systems (Symbolic Computation / Artificial Intelligence)</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Edited by Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Wahlster<br />\n1989</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nUser models have recently attracted much research interest in the field of artificial intelligence dialog systems. It has become evident that a flexible user-oriented dialog behavior of such systems can be realized only if the system disposes of a model of the user, containing assumptions about the user`s background knowledge as well as the user`s goals and plans in consulting the system. Research in the field of user models investigates how such assumptions can be automatically created, represented and exploited by the system in the course of an interaction with the user. This volume is the first survey pertaining to the field of user modeling. Most of the prominent international researchers in this area have contributed to this volume. Their papers are grouped into four sections: The introductory section contains a general view of the field as a whole, and a number of surveys of specific problems and techniques in user modeling. Sections two and three describe eight user modeling systems, with the focus lying on the automatic creation and exploitation of assumptions about the user respectively. The final section discusses several limits of current systems, and proposes solutions as to how some of the shortcomings might be overcome. In order to increase the quality and the coherency of the volume, each paper has been reviewed by all other contributors. Cross-references have been integrated wherever appropriate. All contributions are introduced in editorial prefaces pertaining to each section. A subject index and an extensive bibliography supplement the book.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Benutzermodellierung-Dialogsystemen-Informatik-Fachberichte-K%C3%BCnstliche-Intelligenz/dp/3540160744/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426521240&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr0&amp;keywords=Benutzmodellierung+in+Dialogsystemen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1995\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/Kobsa-BenutzermodellierunginDialogsystemen.jpg\" alt=\"Kobsa-BenutzermodellierunginDialogsystemen\" width=\"348\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/Kobsa-BenutzermodellierunginDialogsystemen.jpg 348w, https://www.informatics.uci.edu/wp-content/informatics/uploads/Kobsa-BenutzermodellierunginDialogsystemen-209x300.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 348px) 100vw, 348px\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Benutzermodellierung in Dialogsystemen (Informatik-Fachberichte / Subreihe K\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz) (German Edition)</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Alfred Kobsa<br />\n1986</p>\n<p class=\"book_paragraph\">\nUser modeling is gradually becoming recognized as a key issue in the design of cooperative computer based dialogue systems. Assumptions about the beliefs, goals and plans of the user are seen as necessary prerequisites for a system to be capable of exhibiting user-oriented dialogue behavior, Research in this field, however, is still incoherent and lacks a solid groundwork of precise problem definitions, proposals for solutions, comparable realized systems. Much work in this area is done on a very informal base.</p>\n<p>This work aims at contributing to such groundwork, both through theoretical analysis and by presenting a user model in which many of the theoretical proposals have been realized.<br />\n</p></div>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"book_listing group\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Karel-The-Robot-Introduction-Programming/dp/0471597252\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-361\" src=\"http://www.informatics.uci.edu//wp-content/informatics/uploads/Karel-the-Robot-A-Gentle-Introduction-to-the-Art-of-Programming-With-Pascal-Richard-E.-Pattis.jpg\" alt=\"book1\" width=\"250\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"book_title\" style=\"font-family: District-Medium, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">Karel The Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Programming</p>\n<p class=\"book_subtitle\" style=\"font-family: District-BoldItalic, Helvetica; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;\">By Richard E.
